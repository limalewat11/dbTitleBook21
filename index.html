It's windy on the Danish island of Samso. Meet the environmentally friendly people who now proudly call their home Energy Island.</p><p>At a time when most countries are producing ever-increasing amounts of CO2, the rather ordinary citizens of Sams� have accomplished something extraordinary--in just ten years they have reduced their carbon emissions by 140% and become almost completely energy independent. A narrative tale and a science book in one, this inspiring true story proves that with a little hard work and a big idea, anyone can make a huge step towards energy conservation.</p></p><p><p>Author/illustrator Allan Drummond studied at the Royal College of Art. His many books include Tin Lizzie, a Green Earth Honor Book. He lives in Savannah, Georgia ,where he is Chair of Illustration at the Savannah College of Art and Design.</p><p>&#x201c;The thrilling idea, the book concludes, is that Samso is &#x2018;not very different from where you live.' Your community doesn't need wind; it needs a spark, to get people to think and work together.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Energy Island</i> opens with the power of wind captured by a pinwheel, an illustration that neatly encapsulates this remarkably accessible book about the path to energy independence on the Danish island of Samso.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this first title in a planned series of picture books about sustainable energy, Drummond combines winsome, kinetic, ink-and-wash illustrations with a succinct, simply phrased, smoothly flowing narrative that describes how Sams� transformed itself.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Starred, Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;The illustrations further personalize the story with energy of their own as they bring Sams� and its residents to life.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Starred, School Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;The message is clear: An initially unconcerned community banded together and took steps that led to their current fame as a model of environmental action; we other residents of the island that is planet Earth can do that, too.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Energy independence may not seem like a gripping topic for a picture book, but Drummond (Tin Lizzie) tells the story of the Danish island of Sams� so engagingly that families may find themselves considering wind turbines for their backyards.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>Little Book Of Woodland Bird Songs</h2><p>A book for the whole family to enjoy and the sequel to the bestselling The Little Book of Garden Bird Songs.Birds can be hard to spot at the best of times and never more so than in the woods, so let this book and your ears do the work instead.

By the end of this book, no walk in the woods will be the same again.</p><p></p><h2>Think Like a Champion: An Informal Education In Business and Life</h2><p>Over the years, President Donald Trump has written many bestselling books, but he has also written shorter essays that encompass his philosophy about how to live life to the fullest, both personally and professionally. In these pieces, which have been personally selected by Trump for this book, he gives his special perspective in what amounts to an "informal education" about success in business and in life. With a foreword by <i>Rich Dad, Poor Dad,</i> author Robert Kiyosaki, Trump's business acumen is on full display in such essays as:<br> <br> *Keep the Big Picture in Mind<br> *Essays, Assets, and Stephen King<br> *Imagination: A Key to Financial Savvy<br> *Financial Literacy<br> *Think Like a Genius<br> *How to Get Rich</p><p><b>Donald J. Trump</b> is the Chairman and President of the Trump Organization. He is the preeminent developer of quality real estate around the world, making the Trump brand synonymous with the gold standard. His commitment to excellence extends from his real estate holdings to the entertainment industry. As the star and co-producer of the NBC hit series <i>The Apprentice</i>, to his award-winning golf courses and skyscrapers, his business acumen is unparalleled. His Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue has become one of the most famous landmark buildings in New York City, and his Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower in New York City has received the coveted Mobil Five-Star Award. He is the archetypal businessman--a deal maker without peer and an ardent philanthropist.Given Trump's larger than life&#x2014;and polarizing&#x2014;public persona, part of Skipp Sudduth's achievement as narrator is his creation of a buffer zone of sorts. Granted, the entrepreneur does deliver a zealous introduction, but as Sudduth takes over, it becomes possible to overlook the positive and negative caricatures of Trump the celebrity and focus on his tangible no-nonsense advice. While viewers of <i>The Apprentice</i> will certainly recognize The Donald 's bravado in the recurring litany of accomplishments related to the global Trump brand, Sudduth's presentation of the career and personal growth tips will resonate with listeners. <i>A Vanguard hardcover.

People today are more fatigued, burned out, and overwhelmed than ever. Smartphones constantly ping and alert and demand our attention.

But, though the uniform is a little different, Callahan soon finds herself right back in the middle of a mystery when a client's pretty, pious nineteen-year-old nanny is gone ... along with the jewelry, silver, and a few rather sensitive real estate documents.</p><p>Before she knows it, the meticulous Callahan is up to her elbows in a case involving illicit love triangles, crooked business deals, long-distance scams, and a dead body. Now she has to roll up her sleeves and start some industrial strength sleuthing to solve -- and survive -- this mess.</p></p><p><p><strong>Kathy Hogan Trocheck</strong> is the author of ten critically acclaimed mysteries, including the Callahan Garrity mystery series. A former reporter for the <em>Atlanta Journal Constitution</em>, she is also the author of <em>Little Bitty Lies</em> and the Edgar�- and Macavity-nominated <em>Savannah Blues</em>, under the name Mary Kay Andrews.</p>Cloying debut of ex-Atlanta cop turned part-time p.i. Callahan Garrity, who, with her wisecracking, three-pack-a-day mom, Edna Mae, also runs House Mouse, a cleaning business that's short on help, which means that Callahan arrives to tidy the Beamish residence just as Kristee, the nanny, is discovered missing--along with jewels, furs, rare coins, and important business papers. Callahan also discovers that the wayward Kristee was juggling three romances, had lied about her Mormon background, was blackmailing the philandering Bo Beamish about a shady real-estate deal he'd hustled, and, as a result of all this--or some of it--is now lying dead in the fur vault at Rich's department store. Whodunit? The House Mouse maids reconnoiter various homes, while the police arrest the wrong suspect. Meanwhile, Callahan makes lots of calls to Utah; Edna Mae pays the killer a visit; and the sinners are separated from the Church of the Latter-day Saints. Overly cute, with (predictably) the cleanup crews finding all the clues. And heavy-handed attempts at social satire, plus leaden repartee between Callahan and her mom and cop friends, don't help. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The females repeat this journey every two to three years.<br> <br>ALL ROADS LEAD home. That thought mingled with the soothing sound of Debussy as Cara descended from the majestic highlands of Tennessee toward the sultry lowcountry of South Carolina. Her brand-new red station wagon wound its way past racing rivers and creeks that flowed south to the ocean, past billboards advertising fireworks, fruit stands, deserted gas stations, and tumbledown antiques shops. Signs of spring&#x2014;yellow jasmine blooms against lush greens&#x2014;dotted the countryside. From time to time a flock of birds would fill the sky, and she would crane her neck to watch them migrating north. A short laugh escaped her lips. We are all heading home to nest, Cara thought.<br> <br>She stretched her long legs as best she could while driving in skinny jeans. The cuff of her white cotton shirt was stained with coffee from a quick swerve. Everything had been too fast in the past few weeks as she scrambled to pack up and move home&#x2014;too many fast decisions and too much fast food. And here she was, journeying the same stretch of road again. Going home never seemed to get easier. She glanced into the rearview mirror as the passing years flashed in her mind. How many times had she made this journey back to the Isle of Palms?<br> <br>At forty, she&#x2019;d driven back from the chilly North to seek refuge at her mother&#x2019;s beach house in the sultry South, as listless as a rudderless ship. Primrose Cottage had been her sanctuary, as it had been her mother&#x2019;s before her. A special place by the sea to recharge one&#x2019;s batteries and find renewed purpose. At fifty, she&#x2019;d buried the past and left again, looking for a fresh start. Now, three years later, like the loggerhead sea turtle she was named for, Caretta was returning to the only place she&#x2019;d ever considered home.<br> <br>She leaned slightly to the right to glance in the rearview mirror again. Her dark eyes were smudged with fatigue and had a few more lines around the corners. She wasn&#x2019;t a child any longer, or even a young woman. Each decision she made now had rippling consequences. Cara felt her resolve stir. She needed to be home now, more than ever.<br> <br><br> <br>LINNEA WAS SO done with the four-lane I-26. She&#x2019;d sped along that endless stretch of highway from the University of South Carolina in Columbia to her home in Charleston so many times in the past four years that she could drive it in her sleep. And there were some trips that had come dangerously close to that. Red Bull could only do so much. This was her last one, however. She&#x2019;d graduated at last, and after a final round of parties, she&#x2019;d crammed everything she could into her blue convertible Mini Cooper and headed home.<br> <br>At last she exited in Charleston. If she&#x2019;d been a tourist, she would have followed the main road and got caught in the horrid logjams on East Bay, Meeting, and King Streets. Every time she came home, there was another hotel going up in the city. Traffic was a nightmare. She tapped her fingers on the steering wheel and swore the whole peninsula was going to sink in the next flood.<br> <br>But, having been born and raised in Charleston, Linnea was no stranger to the city. She made a sharp right, then shot down Broad Street toward the water, ducking down narrow alleys only locals knew about&#x2014;bumpy cobblestone roads lined with parked cars. After two more turns, she veered sharply into their driveway on Tradd Street, then slammed on the brakes. Panting and clutching the wheel, she stared at the imposing black iron gate and exhaled in relief that she hadn&#x2019;t hit it. Her father would have tanned her hide if she&#x2019;d damaged that elaborately curved and exorbitantly expensive ironwork.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Mama . . .&#x201d; she muttered as she collected her wits. Her mother had complained for years about how the tourists brazenly peeked into their walled garden or even through the windows. While gardening one Sunday morning a few months ago, her mother had turned her head to see a strange man standing inside their enclosed garden taking pictures as free as he pleased&#x2014;including one of her bent over pulling weeds. She&#x2019;d screamed at him, but he&#x2019;d only laughed and strolled away. Her first call was to the police and the next to an ironsmith. Of course, being Tradd Street, it had to be a skilled craftsman who could create an elaborate, Charleston-worthy gate in the style of Philip Simmons. Daddy&#x2019;d had a fit when he saw the bill.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hell, Julia,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d argued, &#x201c;that fella just took a picture of your best side.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mama had won the argument, of course, as she had with each improvement of the grand house on Tradd.<br> <br>Linnea had completely forgotten about this when she turned into the driveway. Staring at it now, she had to admit that it was imposing, if annoying.<br> <br>She dug through her purse and pulled out the slip of paper with the combination her mother had e-mailed to her. She raised her sunglasses, then carefully punched in the numbers, and with a gratifying click, the great gate smoothly split open. Linnea felt pretentious driving through and wondered if that was exactly the effect her mother had hoped for. After all, she did love panache.<br> <br>Linnea parked in front of the stately cream stucco house and tapped the horn twice in announcement of her arrival. Manicured ivy climbed the walls of the garage along trellises&#x2014;her mother wouldn&#x2019;t allow an untidy mess&#x2014;and flowers exuberantly tumbled from classic Charleston window boxes. Linnea was always proud to bring her friends to her house near the famous Charleston Battery in the golden perimeter known as South of Broad. The handsome Greek revival never failed to impress with its gracious three-story piazza. But, in the end, it was just home.<br> <br>She ran her fingers through her blond hair, which fell smooth and straight to her shoulders, the same cut she&#x2019;d worn some version of since high school. She swiped on a bit of rosy lip gloss and blush to cover up the effects of one too many graduation parties the previous week. God knew, her mother had binocular vision when it came to telltale red eyes.<br> <br>Linnea climbed out of the car and smoothed out her floral swing skirt. One of her passions was vintage clothing, especially from the 1950s. No sooner had she closed her door than her younger brother trotted around the house from the garden.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cooper!&#x201d; she called out. Her knight in shining armor was coming to carry her luggage.<br> <br>Cooper Pringle Rutledge was wearing baggy beige shorts frayed at the hem and a stretched-out Porter-Gaud T-shirt. He was in that adorable stage she liked to call a man-child. At eighteen, he was tall and long-legged like his aunt Cara. Like her, he took after the Rutledge side of the family with his thick, dark hair and eyes and his strong jaw and proud nose. He looked like a young John Kennedy. In contrast, Linnea was a tintype of her grandmother Olivia. Petite, blond, and blue-eyed, she fit the stereotype of a southern belle, even if the expectations chafed her.<br> <br>Cooper trotted toward her with his friendly, gangly gait. He was restless, like his father, always tossing a ball in the air, rushing from place to place, playing sports, and perfecting his game. Linnea was more solitary. She preferred to read, sew her own vintage-style clothes, or walk outdoors and observe nature. The Tortoise and the Hare, her mother had called them growing up. The fact that Linnea was mad for sea turtles made the description apropos.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Sis,&#x201d; Cooper called out. When he reached her side, he bent to kiss her cheek. &#x201c;Nice to have you back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice of you to not make it to my graduation.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cooper ducked his head with a wry grin. &#x201c;Yeah, about that . . . sorry. It was the big Porter-Gaud&#x2013;Bishop England basketball game.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bigger than my college graduation?&#x201d; she asked, her words ringing with doubt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, well, I&#x2019;m on the team.&#x201d; He looked up at her, eyes twinkling. &#x201c;We can make it up when you come to my graduation next week.&#x201d;<br> <br>Linnea could never stay mad at him. She socked him in the arm. &#x201c;Yeah, well,&#x201d; she replied, teasing his phrasing, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see if I can make it. I&#x2019;ve got a lot of parties and all. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>They laughed, both knowing she wouldn&#x2019;t miss it.<br> <br>A shiny black pickup truck pulled up, dwarfing her car. She was blinded by the amount of chrome on the grille. The big engine rumbled loudly, and inside the cab she saw four boys she&#x2019;d watched grow up since the first grade. She greeted them all warmly, congratulating them all on somehow managing to graduate high school.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gotta go,&#x201d; Cooper called out as he climbed into the truck&#x2014;probably the driver&#x2019;s graduation gift.<br> <br>Linnea was flabbergasted. &#x201c;What? You&#x2019;re leaving? I just got here!&#x201d;<br> <br>He shrugged with an endearing grin, and she couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh. That boy&#x2019;s smile is going to get him into trouble someday, she thought as she called out, &#x201c;Thanks for helping me with my luggage!&#x201d;<br> <br>The truck&#x2019;s engine roared with a show of testosterone and whipped out of the driveway. Before it squealed down the street, she heard Cooper bark out to a friend, &#x201c;Shut up, that&#x2019;s my sister!&#x201d;<br> <br>Linnea shook her head and wondered what kind of trouble her brother was going to get into this time. Mama had called her just last week, worried to leave Cooper home alone for her graduation since Missy Bond&#x2019;s house had just been trashed by a graduation party.<br> <br>She wiped away the perspiration forming along her brow. It was four o&#x2019;clock on a steamy May afternoon. Summer had come early this year. The azaleas had bloomed in February, and it was already hitting the nineties. Early springs and late winters seemed to be the new normal.<br> <br>She almost burned her fingers opening her trunk. &#x201c;Thanks a lot, Cooper,&#x201d; she groaned upon seeing it packed to the gills. As she began tugging out the boxes, though, she heard the rumble of the garage door opening.<br> <br>Rescue came in the form of her father.<br> <br>&#x201c;Daddy!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, baby girl! Welcome home!&#x201d;<br> <br>She set a box down on the cement and hurried into his embrace. Her daddy, Palmer Rutledge, took after his mother&#x2019;s side. Like her, he was blond and blue-eyed. In bare feet he reached five feet eight inches, but most of his shoes boosted his height another inch. Being relatively short was a sore point between him and her aunt Cara. She was tall and dark; he was short and blond. Palmer claimed their mother got the genes mixed up.<br> <br>He was a handsome man, dependably clean-shaven and well presented in his usual uniform of polished shoes, a pale polo, and tan trousers. Looking at him in the full sun, Linnea could see his hair was thinning on top. His belly was fuller, too. But it was his ruddy cheeks so early in the day that concerned her. In his hand was a thick-cut crystal glass half-filled with ice and a brown liquid she&#x2019;d bet good money was bourbon.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a little early for a cocktail, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>He squinted and shook the ice in his glass. &#x201c;I got home early to see my little girl and now she&#x2019;s busting my chops?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Daddy. I&#x2019;m just teasing,&#x201d; she said quickly, though it wasn&#x2019;t true. When her parents had come up to Columbia the previous weekend for her graduation, Linnea had been shocked at how much her father drank. He downed bourbon like water, morning and night. When she&#x2019;d mentioned it to her mother, Julia had simply tightened her lips and shaken her head, both in resignation and refusal to discuss it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look at you,&#x201d; he said, holding her at arm&#x2019;s length. &#x201c;I swear, you look more like my mama every day.&#x201d; He smiled wryly at her skirt. &#x201c;Or maybe it&#x2019;s just &#x2019;cause you&#x2019;re wearing her clothes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Daddy,&#x201d; Linnea said with a teasing pout. &#x201c;I made this skirt myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s right pretty,&#x201d; he said, and gently tapped her nose. &#x201c;Just like you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Palmer looked around as he walked toward her car trunk. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Cooper? I sent him out here to fetch your luggage.&#x201d;<br> <br>Linnea followed him. &#x201c;He took off when a truck full of his friends pulled up. Lord, all those babies are becoming men already. Unleashed on an unsuspecting world.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I swear, that boy&#x2019;s never around when you need him. He&#x2019;s perfected the art of the dodge.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;At least he made it through high school.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her father made a face. &#x201c;Thanks to a handshake and a hefty donation. Cooper never took to school like you did. He hasn&#x2019;t the sense God gave a mule.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, he&#x2019;s smart,&#x201d; Linnea countered, reaching into the trunk. Defending her little brother was second nature to her. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just lazy.&#x201d; She pulled out a box and handed it to her father. &#x201c;And he sure is cute. The girls must be going crazy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Palmer rubbed his jaw to hide his smile. It was obvious her father doted on the boy. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t shoo &#x2019;em away with a flyswatter.&#x201d; He narrowed his gaze on her. &#x201c;What about you? You&#x2019;ve got some fish on the hook I should meet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Linnea said, turning back to the trunk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; he replied, hoisting the box. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re as pretty as they come. I used to sleep with a shotgun by my bed when you were in high school for all the tomcats crying at your window.&#x201d;<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t reply because it was true. In high school she&#x2019;d been an incorrigible flirt. With experience, however, she&#x2019;d grown choosier.<br> <br>Palmer started walking toward the house. Over his shoulder he called, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not getting any younger, you know.&#x201d;<br> <br>Linnea felt the drag of the suitcase. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m only twenty-two! Hardly an old maid!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your mama married me at your age.&#x201d; He set the box by the door with a thunk. &#x201c;Graduation in May. A bride in June.&#x201d;<br> <br>She wanted to say, And look how well that turned out, but she wasn&#x2019;t that stupid. Linnea just parked the luggage by the door, turned on her heel and walked back to the car to carry the last vestiges of her college life into her childhood home. With each step, she felt her family&#x2019;s expectations closing in around her.<br> <br><br> <br>THE SKY WAS as black as tar by the time Cara left the mainland to cross the Connector Bridge to the island. Few stars shone through the night, the moon was hidden by clouds, and the vast acres of salt marsh were as inky as the sky. Ahead, tiny red lights blinked on the island&#x2019;s water tower, and here and there golden light shone from a few houses.

The gentle name of the small barrier island off the Charleston coast was synonymous with home to her. A sun-kissed place where visitors came to feel the caress of salt-tinged breezes, dip their toes into the warm waters of the Atlantic, and stare out over the expanse of sea and sky. Here they could escape from the sometimes overwhelming strains of a hectic life beyond the marshland. Her mama used to say that barrier islands protected the mainland from the storms. But in truth, the marshes protected the islands from the stress of the mainland.<br> <br>Life was different on the islands. The pace was slower, the summer wind stronger.

In addition, this collection contains seven remarkable short stories; an extract on Indian women from Child's groundbreaking History of the Condition of Women in Various Ages and Nations (1835); a selection from her best-selling volume of journalistic sketches, <i>Letters from New-York</i> (1843); and her eloquent<i> Appeal for Indians</i> (1868).

Nonetheless, it is a form beloved and practiced by literature's greatest writers. In the Art Of The Novella series, Melville House celebrates this renegade art form and its practitioners with titles that are, in many instances, presented in book form for the first time.</p><p><b>Herman Melville</b> was born in New York City in 1819. At eighteen he set sail on a whaler, and upon his return, wrote a series of bestselling adventure novels based on his travels, including <i>Typee</i> and <i>Omoo</i>, which made him famous. Starting with <i>Moby-Dick</i> in 1851, however, his increasingly complex and challenging work drew more and more negative criticism, until 1857 when, after his collection <i>Piazza Tales</i> (which included <i>Bartleby the Scrivener</i>), and the novel <i>The Confidence Man</i>, Melville stopped publishing fiction. He drifted into obscurity, writing poetry and working for the Customs House in New York City, until his death in 1891."I wanted them all, even those I'd already read."<br> <b>&#x2014;Ron Rosenbaum, <i>The New York Observer</i></b><br><br> "Small wonders."<br> <b>&#x2014;<i>Time Out London</i></b><br><br> <i>"</i>[F]irst-rate...astutely selected and attractively packaged...indisputably great works."<br> <b>&#x2014;Adam Begley, <i>The New York Observer</i></b><br><br> "I&#x2019;ve always been haunted by Bartleby, the proto-slacker.

Except in England.<br> He sat up in bed.&nbsp; He was, indeed, in England, in the house called Windward Hall that he had owned for some years.&nbsp; He had landed in the early evening in the Strategic Services Gulfstream 600, on which he had caught a ride from Teterboro, New Jersey.&nbsp; The company jet was in England or Europe on almst a weekly basis, and the private runway on his land was long enough to accommodate it for landing and takeoff.&nbsp; It was a convenient way to commute between his New York residence and his house in England.<br><br>He looked at the bedside clock: a little after six AM.&nbsp; He fell back onto his pillow, tried for another hour of sleep and failed.&nbsp; He had come alone to England, so there was no opportunity of an erotic nature to occupy him until the kitchen was open for business, and he was hungry.&nbsp; He got out of bed and flung open the curtains in the room, then got back into bed with yesterday&#x2019;s crossword puzzle which he had not finished.<br> He regretted not inviting a companion on this trip, but his mind turned to the beautiful woman whose country house was just across the Beaulieu River from his.&nbsp; At that moment, his cellphone rang.&nbsp; &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; she said with a husky voice.&nbsp; &#x201c;I hope I didn&#x2019;t wake you.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Good morning, Felicity; I wish you were here to wake me properly.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m nearly there, darling,&#x201d; she replied, chuckling; just across the river.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Then come and have breakfast with me.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to have <i>you</i> for breakfast, but I have to be in London at 9:30 for an important meeting at the Foreign Ministry.&#x201d;&nbsp; Felicity was director of MI-6, the British foreign intelligence service, which came under the purview of the Foreign Minister.<br> &#x201c;What a pity,&#x201d; Stone said.<br> &#x201c;Not to worry; I&#x2019;ll be down tomorrow afternoon for the weekend.&nbsp; Why don&#x2019;t you host a dinner party?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Well, I didn&#x2019;t bring any guests with me, so I guess it will just have to be the two of us.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Tell you what,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I will assemble the guests for&nbsp; a table of, say, eight?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What a good idea; you&#x2019;re better acquainted with the locals than I.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Consider it done; I&#x2019;ll bring the place cards with me, so don&#x2019;t bother about that.&nbsp; Shall we say seven for eight?&#x201d;&nbsp; In British parlance, this meant dinner at eight, and show up at seven, if you&#x2019;d like a drink first.<br> &#x201c;Perfect.&nbsp; I&#x2019;ll get the cook to work on a menu and I&#x2019;ll unearth some good bottles from the cellar.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I will look forward to it,&#x201d; She said.<br> &#x201c;And bring your toothbrush; we&#x2019;ll make a weekend of it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What a good idea!.&#x201d;&nbsp; She made a kissing noise and hung up.<br> Stone went back to his crossword, a happier man.<br> &nbsp;<br> The following evening, dressed in his Royal Yacht Squadron mess kit - essentally, a tuxedo with a short, naval-style jacket and the appropriate insignia - inspected the beautifully set table in the small dining room, then went to the library, where drinks would be served.&nbsp; It was about three minutes past seven when he heard the doorbell, and a couple of minutes later, Dame Felicity Devonshire entered the library, followed by three couples.&nbsp; One, he recognized as Felicity&#x2019;s boss, the foreign minister, Sir Oswald Towne and Lady Towne, AKA Dierdre;&nbsp;&nbsp; another was a younger man in a proper naval mess kit, sporting quite a lot of braid, and his apparent wife; the third couple looked familiar.<br> &#x201c;Stone,&#x201d; Felicity said,&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course you know Sir Oswald and Lady Towne - Ozzie and Dierdre.&#x201d;&nbsp; They all shook hands.&nbsp; &#x201c;And this is Admiral Sir Timothy Barnes, and Lady Barnes, Tim and Kate.&#x201d; More handshaking.&nbsp; &#x201c;Tim is the First Sea Lord,&#x201d; Felicity added.&nbsp; Hands were shaken.<br> Stone knew that that post was the Royal Navy equivalent of the American chief of naval operations.<br> &#x201c;And,&#x201d; Felicity said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if you&#x2019;ve met the newly-elected commodore of the Royal Yacht Squadron, Derek Drummond, and his wife, Hildy.&#x201d;&nbsp; Drummond was also dressed in a Squadron mess kit, which should have been a clue.<br> &#x201c;Congratulations on your election,&#x201d; Stone said, shaking their hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Stone; it&#x2019;s good to see an American member here.&#x201d; the commodore replied.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to be here,&#x201d; Stone said.&#x201d;<br> Geoffrey, the butler, served champagne and cocktails, and there was chat among the guests and their hosts.<br> &#x201c;Do you have a place in the neighborhood?&#x201d; Stone asked Tim Barnes.<br> &#x201c;No, I had to come down from London for the launching of a new submarine; Ozzie and Dierdre were staying with Felicity, and she asked us to join them, so my barge brought us from Portsmouth to her dock on the Beaulieu.<br> &#x201c;What does an admiral&#x2019;s barge consist of these days?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br> &#x201c;A very comfortable Nelson motorboat of forty feet; it suitable for a weekend place.&#x201d;<br> Felicity joined them.&nbsp; &#x201c;Tim has also just come from a visit to our Station Two, in the Scottish Highlands.&nbsp; He was kind enough to give me a lift back in a naval aircraft.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Why does MI-6 have a station so far north?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br> &#x201c;Station Two is our training facility for new recruits to the service,&#x201d; she said.&nbsp; &#x201c;I drove up there last week for my own inspection, but I was called back to London and had to leave my car there and fly back.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Is this the Aston Martin DB 11?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It is, and I miss it already.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;How will you get it back from Scotland?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;A good question; would you like to drive it back?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a very tempting thought,&#x201d; Stone said.&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never driven that car.&#x201d;<br> The foreign minister joined them in time to hear that exchange.&nbsp; &#x201c;You look like a fit fellow,&#x201d; he said to Stone.&nbsp; You might enjoy a taste of the training up there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good idea,&#x201d; Tim said.&nbsp; &#x201c;The place is run by an old chum of mine, a colonel in the Royal Marines.&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be happy to give him a call and tell him not to be too hard on you.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Is this a sort of boot camp, then?&#x201d; Stone asked, intrigued.<br> &#x201c;The first two weeks are very much a boot camp,&#x201d; Tim replied.&nbsp; &#x201c;Lots of hikes and runs, weapons training, hand to hand fighting, that sort of thing.&nbsp; The next two months are all the secret stuff: codes; tradecraft, communications: all the James Bond stuff.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re in the first week of training now,&#x201d; Felicity said.&nbsp; &#x201c;You could join them for the second week, then drive the car back.&#x201d; She turned to the FM: &#x201c;Stone is a consultant to our colleages at Langley, so he&#x2019;s a family member, in a way.&nbsp; He&#x2019;s also been of help to us on occasion.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Then I don&#x2019;t see why he shouldn&#x2019;t have a bit of fun at our expense,&#x201d; the FM said.&nbsp; &#x201c;Send me an authorization to sign - and, of course a release for his signature, absolving us from any liability for serious injury or an early death.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You make it sound like such fun,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;but . . . &#x201c;<br> &#x201d;Nonsense,&#x201d; the FM chortled, clapping him on the back.&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all decided and authorized.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They were called in to dinner, and Stone put the thought of a Highland vacation out of his mind.&nbsp; He noticed that Felicity left the table to use her phone for a few minutes, but that often happened.&nbsp; <br> She returned to the table.&nbsp; &#x201c;Good news,&#x201d; she said &#x201c;We&#x2019;re flying some equipment and a few people up to Station Two tomorrow, and the aircraft will pick you up at your airstrip at seven o&#x2019;clock tomorrow morning.&#x201d;<br> Stone choked on his wine.<br> &#x201c;I envy you the experience,&#x201d; the FM said.&nbsp; &#x201c;Just the sort of romp I&#x2019;d have enjoyed in my youth.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not all that young,&#x201d; Stone said, and everyone laughed heartily.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1A<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Stone woke up with a warm hand cradling his genitals.&nbsp; He checked the narrow opening in the curtains: still dark outside.<br> &#x201c;Ah, you&#x2019;re awake,&#x201d; Felicity said, climbing on top of him.<br> &#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Five AM,&#x201d; she said.&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve time for love, breakfast and packing.&nbsp; We&#x2019;re starting with love.&#x201d;<br> They spent half an hour on love, then Stone dove into a shower.&nbsp; When he came out, Felicity was dressed.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call Stan to help you with the boat,&#x201d; he said.<br> &#x201c;Not to worry; my car is picking me up here in about three-quarters of an hour.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Call down for breakfast,&#x201d; he said.&nbsp; &#x201c;Just press the button marked Kitchen.&nbsp; I&#x2019;ll have the usual; you have whatever you like.&nbsp; He grabbed a large leather duffle, and began stuffing things into it.<br> &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Felicity said, &#x201c;just pack what you&#x2019;ll need for the return drive; Station Two will provide you with everything else.&#x201d;&nbsp; She picked up the phone and ordered breakfast.<br> &nbsp;<br> At 7 AM Stone stood at the hangar on his airstrip and watched the airplane turn final.&nbsp; To his surprise, it was a Dakota, the British name for the American DC-3 or C-47.&nbsp; It touched down lightly ran down half the runway, then turned 180 Degrees and stopped where he stood.&nbsp; He walked toward the airplane, propeller was whipping his clothes around him. The rear door opened, and a man in fatigues, what the Brits called, &#x2018;battle dress,&#x2019; clapped his hands together and held them out to receive Stone&#x2019;s duffle.&nbsp; Stone climbed the ladder and was directed forward past other luggage, each with a green canvas object secured to it.&nbsp; There were no proper seats, so he set himself down on a sort of canvas bench, affixed to the airplane&#x2019;s bare metal.&nbsp; There was no insulation.<br> He got into his seat harness up front, just aft of the cockpit, which gave him a good view of the pilot and his controls.&nbsp; The rear door was closed, the ladder stowed, and the pilot, advanced the throttles slightly applied right brake and sputn the airplane around.&nbsp; He then shoved the throttles all the way forward, and the airplane left the ground in what seemed to Stone an amazingly short time.<br> He was handed a set of ear protectors, like a headset without the wiring, and he gratefully put them on.&nbsp; There was no point in trying to speak to his companions, because the engine noise was too great, and they were wearing the same earmuffs he wore.<br><br>The man next to him handed him a copy of the <i>International New York Times - </i>yesterday&#x2019;s, as it happened, and in the next hour and a half he&#x2019;d read every word of it.&nbsp; They were somewhere over the Midlands, at 8,000 feet, on top of a cloud layer.&nbsp; He started on the crossword, which was challenging enough to engage him for another hour and a half.&nbsp; <br> The airplane began a descent, and suddenly, all the passengers were on their feet, strapping on backpacks.&nbsp; A sergeant handed Stone one and helped him get into it.&nbsp; He&nbsp; got close to Stone&#x2019;s ear and lifted a muff.&nbsp; &#x201c;Ever jumped before?&#x201d; he yelled.<br> Stone shook his head.&nbsp; &#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d; he shouted back, but the man couldn&#x2019;t hear him.&nbsp; Stone could hear him shouting, though.&nbsp; The man took a length of nylon line from behind Stone&#x2019;s shoulder and clipped one end of it to a steel cable running the length of the cabin.&nbsp; &#x201c;Static line,&#x201d; he shouted.&nbsp; &#x201c;Count to ten; if your chute doesn&#x2019;t open by the time you&#x2019;re finished, pull this.&#x201d;&nbsp; He held up a triangular piece of tubing, took Stone&#x2019;s arm and moved it out and up from his body.&nbsp; &#x201c;Rip cord,&#x201d; he said.<br> &#x201c;Wait a minute!&#x201d; Stone shouted, but the group of men started shuffling aft, and the sergeant grabbed Stone&#x2019;s arm and marched him along, snatching the muffs from his ears.&nbsp; There was a red light over the open rear door, and as he watched it went out, and a green light came on.&nbsp; People began to jump out of the airplane.&nbsp; As Stone approached the open door he craned his neck to get a look outside, and as he did the sergeant pushed him through the door.&nbsp; &#x201c;Noooooooo,&#x201d; Stone yelled as he fell into the daylight.&nbsp; Immediately, he felt a hard jerk, and he looked up to see his parachute billowing.<br><br>Suddenly, it was quiet, as the airplane flew away, turning.&nbsp; There was no wind, and Stone could hear a dog barking somewhere on the ground.&nbsp; The parachutes of those who had jumped before him were stretched out into a line, and looking down, from what he estimated was a thousand feet or so, he saw a mostly bare, green landscape, with a tree here and there.<br> He knew from old movies that he could pull on the straps holding him to alter his direction, but he seemed aligned with everyone else, so he didn&#x2019;t see any point in experimenting.&nbsp; He began to think about how he was going to handle the landing.&nbsp; The others had their feet together, so he kept his that way.<br> As he neared the ground he seemed to be going faster and faster as it rose to meet him, then his feet struck the ground and he fell, rolling over.&nbsp; The chute settled over him, blocking his view of everything.<br> &#x201c;Get out of there,&#x201d; someone shouted and pulled at the nylon.&nbsp; Stone got to his feet and figured out how to release the harness, then he was standing and, amazingly, alive.&nbsp; A man was gathering up his parachute.<br> Another man tugged at his sleeve and pointed up.&nbsp; Stone looked to see several chutes floating down.&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s your luggage,&#x201d; the man said.&nbsp; Stone was surprised that he wasn&#x2019;t shouting, but speaking fairly normally.&nbsp; &#x201c;It will be taken by truck to your quarters.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;How do I get there?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br> &#x201c;You run,&#x201d; the man said; follow the others, and don&#x2019;t get lost; because you might never be seen again.&#x201d;&nbsp; He pointed Stone in the right direction and gave him a shove.&nbsp; Stone was wearing a pair of high-topped thickly-soled walking shoes that he used on pavement, and they worked fairly well.&nbsp; He began jogging along, unbuttoning his jacket as he warmed up.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> Half an hour later the group pulled up at a gate in a high, chain-link fence with coils of razor wire at the top.&nbsp; Stone wondered if that was meant to keep people out or, perhaps, in.&nbsp; He was pleased to see that he wasn&#x2019;t breathing any harder than the other men in the party.&nbsp; They were herded through the gat and into a quonset hut, with its semicircular roofline.&nbsp; Inside there were folding chairs, and people were getting out of their warmer clothing and mopping their brows.&nbsp; Stone followed the line, just as he had done since they jumped, making him the last to sit down.<br> A man wearing a military sweater with epaulets came into the hut and walked to the front of the room.&nbsp; &#x201c;Listen up,&#x201d; he said.&nbsp; &#x201c;I am Captain Moffat; you no longer have names; you are designated. . . &#x201c; he pointed at Stone, then down he line . . &#x201c;Alpha, Beta, Charley, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel.&nbsp; While you are at Station Two you will not tell anyone your former name, nor anything about yourself.&nbsp; Does anyone not understand that?&#x201d;&nbsp; He waited for a moment and was met ...</p><h2>Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America</h2><p><p><strong>A provocative history that reveals how guns&#x2015;not abortion, race, or religion&#x2015;are at the heart of America's cultural divide.</strong></p><em>Gunfight</em> promises to be a seminal work in its examination of America's four-centuries-long political battle over gun control and the right to bear arms. In the tradition of <em>Gideon's Trumpet</em>, Adam Winkler uses the landmark 2008 case <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em>, which invalidated a law banning handguns in the nation's capital, as a springboard for a groundbreaking historical narrative. From the Founding Fathers and the Second Amendment to the origins of the Klan, ironically as a gun control organization, the debate over guns has always generated controversy. Whether examining the Black Panthers' role in provoking the modern gun rights movement or Ronald Reagan's efforts to curtail gun ownership, Winkler brilliantly weaves together the dramatic stories of gun rights advocates and gun control lobbyists, providing often unexpected insights into the venomous debate that now cleaves our nation. 20 black-and-white illustrations</p><p><strong>Adam Winkler</strong> is a professor at UCLA School of Law, where he specializes in American constitutional law.

Organized by decade, the book includes a wealth of archival material and photographs&#x2014;menus; invitations; pictures of Alice at the restaurant and around the world, with those who have passed through her life&#x2014;and interviews from public figures and cooks who have been inspired by or mentored at the restaurant.<br> &nbsp;<br> This tribute to the delicious food revolution that began with Alice Waters and Chez Panisse is an important work for anyone who cares about food, sustainability, and the powerful legacy that Alice has built.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, August 2011</strong>: In 1971, a young Montessori teacher with no cooking experience beyond having friends to dinner inspired some of these friends to help her open a restaurant in Berkley, serving one perfectly delicious meal each night. In <i>40 Years of Chez Panisse: The Power of Gathering</i>, Alice Waters gives a lively history of how this modest beginning grew into a mecca that helped catalyze the rise of local food culture. Photos and ephemera that evoke each decade come alive through vivid little stories from 90 other collaborators and patrons&#x2014;the chefs, waiters, fishmongers, farmers, winemakers, bakers, food writers, and friends who grew with the restaurant into an extended, cross-generational family.<p></p> First galvanized by political action at UCLA in the mid-&#x2018;60s, Waters experienced a more personal revolution in Europe: Paris taught her how food &#x201c;anchored life to the land&#x201d; and caf� culture built community; in London, she devoured the culinary classics Elizabeth David, internalizing her ethic of seeking fresh, local ingredients and &#x201c;leaving well alone&#x201d;; and in Greece and Turkey, she awakened to the transformative power of hospitality. Backed by an inventive crew, Waters brought all these elements to life at Chez Panisse, buying directly from growers (giving them, for the first time, bylines on the menu) and cultivating a hospitality that extended into the community through incredible parties and initiatives like the Edible Schoolyard Project. Beyond creating four decades of memorable meals, Chez Panisse demonstrated how restaurants can shift America's cultural relationship to agriculture and eating, a change that gains momentum each year. Destined to become a food-lit classic, this gorgeous volume pays homage to the power of gathering around a table, culminating in this luscious truth: "ripeness is all." --<i>Mari Malcolm</i>ALICE WATERS&#x2019;s influence on American cooking is unrivaled. She opened Chez Panisse (named Best Restaurant in America by <i>Gourmet</i>) in 1971, Chez Panisse Caf� in 1980, and Caf� Fanny in 1984. She founded her career on creating dishes using fresh, local, and seasonal ingredients long before sustainability was a household term. Among her many awards, Alice has received the James Beard Best Chef in America, Humanitarian, and Lifetime Achievement awards, and most recently the French L�gion d&#x2019;Honneur. In 1996, she created the Chez Panisse Foundation to fund the Edible Schoolyard, a model of edible education in the public school system. She is the author of eight cookbooks, most recently <i>In the Green Kitchen</i> and <i>The Art of Simple Food</i>.

Filling a huge gap in historical literature that long focused on the non-white, eminent historian Nell Irvin Painter guides us through more than two thousand years of Western civilization, tracing not only the invention of the idea of race but also the frequent worship of &#x201c;whiteness&#x201d; for economic, social, scientific, and political ends.<br><br> Our story begins in Greek and Roman antiquity, where the concept of race did not exist, only geography and the opportunity to conquer and enslave others. Not until the eighteenth century did an obsession with whiteness flourish, with the German invention of the notion of Caucasian beauty. This theory made northern Europeans into &#x201c;Saxons,&#x201d; &#x201c;Anglo-Saxons,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Teutons,&#x201d; envisioned as uniquely handsome natural rulers.<br><br> Here was a worldview congenial to northern Europeans bent on empire. There followed an explosion of theories of race, now focusing on racial temperament as well as skin color. Spread by such intellectuals as Madame de Stael and Thomas Carlyle, white race theory soon reached North America with a vengeance. Its chief spokesman, Ralph Waldo Emerson, did the most to label Anglo-Saxons&#x2015;icons of beauty and virtue&#x2015;as the only true Americans. It was an ideal that excluded not only blacks but also all ethnic groups not of Protestant, northern European background. The Irish and Native Americans were out and, later, so were the Chinese, Jews, Italians, Slavs, and Greeks&#x2015;all deemed racially alien. Did immigrations threaten the very existence of America? Americans were assumed to be white, but who among poor immigrants could become truly American? A tortured and convoluted series of scientific explorations developed&#x2015;theories intended to keep Anglo-Saxons at the top: the ever-popular measurement of skulls, the powerful eugenics movement, and highly biased intelligence tests&#x2015;all designed to keep working people out and down.<br><br> As Painter reveals, power&#x2015;supported by economics, science, and politics&#x2015;continued to drive exclusionary notions of whiteness until, deep into the twentieth century, political realities enlarged the category of truly American.<br><br> A story filled with towering historical figures, <em>The History of White People</em> forcefully reminds us that the concept of one white race is a recent invention. The meaning, importance, and realty of this all-too-human thesis of race have buckled under the weight of a long and rich unfolding of events. 70 illustrations</p><p>Advance praise for <em>The History of White People</em>:<br><br> &#x201c;Deeply researched, intelligent, and wonderfully common-sensical, this is a ground-breaking book, and if we&#x2019;re ever going to get to that so- called &#x2018;post-racial&#x2019; society, a necessary book. It locates race where it actually exists, inside our heads, and shows us how recently it came to reside there.&#x201d;&#x2015;Russell Banks, author of <em>The Sweet Hereafter</em> and <em>Affliction</em><br><br> &#x201c;In this wide-ranging and passionate book, Nell Painter makes the story of American history into something new. Her array of writers, artists, and politicians, some familiar and some surprising, struggle mightily to create a concept many Americans of all backgrounds now take for granted: &#x2018;white people.&#x2019; &#x201d;&#x2015;Edward Ayers, author of <em>In the Presence of Mine Enemies</em><br><br> &#x201c;<em>The History of White People</em> is a brilliant meditation on the invention of the idea of &#x2018;whiteness.&#x2019; Deeply researched and elegantly written, Painter&#x2019;s presentation will certainly spark conversation and controversy&#x2015;as it should. Painter&#x2019;s high-octane intelligence makes her perfectly suited to the task.&#x201d;&#x2015;Annette Gordon-Reed, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <em>The Hemingses of Monticello</em><br><br> &#x201c;Nell Painter&#x2019;s <em>The History of White People</em> is an amazing race-bending narrative. With grace and energy, she confronts the myth of white people as race-less. She offers an eye-opening examination of slavery, the creation of white-ness, and the way in which racial categories have been both false and destructive. This is story-telling at its best.&#x201d;&#x2015;Ellen Goodman, syndicated columnist, <em>Washington Post</em> Writers Group<br><br> &#x201c;Not since Stephen Jay Gould&#x2019;s <em>The Mismeasure of Man</em> has there been such a synoptically provocative appreciation of the myths by which a now demographically challenged people sustained themselves and restrained others.&#x201d;&#x2015;David Levering Lewis, professor of history, New York University Abu Dhabi, and Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <em>W.

Barker, recognizing it for what it is, uses the key to unlock an anonymous door in the alleyway, which opens to an underground tunnel leading to Downing Street. </p><p>The Prime Minister has a small task for Cyrus Barker. A Foreign Office agent stole a satchel in Eastern Europe, but was then himself murdered at Charing Cross. The satchel contains a document desperately wanted by the German government, but while the agent was killed, the satchel remains in English hands. With a cold war brewing between England and Germany, it's in England's interest to return the document contained in the satchel to its original owners and keep it out of German hands. </p><p>The document is an unnamed first century gospel; the original owner is the Vatican. And the German government isn't the only group trying to get possession of it. With secret societies, government assassins, political groups, and shadowy figures of all sorts doing everything they can&#x2015;attacks, murders, counter-attacks, and even massive street battles&#x2015;to acquire the satchel and its contents, this small task might be beyond even the prodigious talents of Cyrus Barker.</p></p><p>WILL THOMAS is the author of the critically acclaimed Cyrus Barker and Thomas Llewelyn series, including <i>Some Danger Involved</i>, <i>Fatal Enquiry</i>, <i>Old Scores</i>, and<i> Blood Is Blood</i>.

He weaves in history&#x2015;London especially comes alive&#x2015;without it seeming like clumps of a school lesson and gives just enough background so that new readers aren't lost in arcane references to past events.

It is time now for the human race to hold still, to delve into its wells of collective wisdom, both ancient and modern.--Arundhati Roy <br><br><i>The Power of Nonviolence,</i> the first anthology of alternatives to war with a historical perspective, with an introduction by Howard Zinn about September 11 and the U.S. response to the terrorist attacks, presents the most salient and persuasive arguments for peace in the last 2,500 years of human history. Arranged chronologically, covering the major conflagrations in the world, <i>The Power of Nonviolence</i> is a compelling step forward in the study of pacifism, a timely anthology that fills a void for people looking for responses to crisis that are not based on guns or bombs.<br><br>Included are some of the most original thinkers about peace and nonviolence-Buddha, Scott Nearing, Henry David Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience," Jane Addams, William Penn on "the end of war," Dorothy Day's position on "Pacifism," Erich Fromm, and Rajendra Prasad. Supplementing these classic voices are more recent advocates of peace: Albert Camus' "Neither Victims Nor Executioners," A. J.

His record was a perfect 49-0.</p><p><i>Unbeaten</i> is the story of this remarkable champion who overcame injury, doubt, and the schemes of corrupt promoters to win the title in a bloody and epic battle with Jersey Joe Walcott in 1952. Rocky packed a devastating punch with an innocent nickname, &#x201c;Suzie Q,&#x201d; against which there was no defense. As the champ, he came to know presidents and movie stars &#x2013; and the organized crime figures who dominated the sport, much to his growing disgust. He may have &#x201c;stood out in boxing like a rose in a garbage dump,&#x201d; as one sportswriter said, but he also fought his own private demons.</p><p>In the hands of the award-winning journalist and biographer Mike Stanton, <i>Unbeaten</i> is more than just a boxing story. It&#x2019;s a classic American tale of immigrant dreams, exceptional talent wedded to exceptional ambitions, compromises in the service of a greater good, astounding success, disillusionment, and a quest to discover what it all meant. Like Suzie Q, it will knock you off your feet.</p></p><p><b>Mike Stanton</b> is the author of<i> The Prince of Providence: The Rise and Fall of Buddy Cianci, America&#x2019;s Most Notorious Mayor</i>, which was a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.

In it, Laurence Dickey argues that the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> contains--and conceals--a great deal of how Smith actually thought a commercial society works. Guided by his conviction that the so-called Adam Smith Problem--the relationship between ethics and economics in Smith's thinking--is a core element in the argument of the work itself, Dickey's commentary focuses on the devices Smith uses to ground his economics in broadly ethical and social categories. An unparalleled guide to an often difficult and perplexing work.</p></p><p>Adam Smith&#39;s masterpiece, first published in 1776, is the foundation of modern economic thought and remains the single most important account of the rise of, and the principles behind, modern capitalism. Written in clear and incisive prose, The Wealth of Nations articulates the concepts indispensable to an understanding of contemporary society; and Robert Reich&#39;s new Introduction for this edition both clarifies Smith&#39;s analyses and illuminates his overall relevance to the world in which we live. As Reich writes, &#34;Smith&#39;s mind ranged over issues as fresh and topical today as they were in the late eighteenth century--jobs, wages, politics, government, trade, education, business, and ethics.&#34;"Adam Smith's enormous authority resides, in the end, in the same property that we discover in Marx: not in any ideology, but in an effort to see to the bottom of things."<br>--Robert L.

From the author of the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning novel <i>The Sympathizer</i> comes a searching exploration of the conflict Americans call the Vietnam War and Vietnamese call the American War&#x2015;a conflict that lives on in the collective memory of both nations.</p><p>From a kaleidoscope of cultural forms&#x2015;novels, memoirs, cemeteries, monuments, films, photography, museum exhibits, video games, souvenirs, and more&#x2015;<i>Nothing Ever Dies </i>brings a comprehensive vision of the war into sharp focus. At stake are ethical questions about how the war should be remembered by participants that include not only Americans and Vietnamese but also Laotians, Cambodians, South Koreans, and Southeast Asian Americans. Too often, memorials valorize the experience of one&#x2019;s own people above all else, honoring their sacrifices while demonizing the &#x201c;enemy&#x201d;&#x2015;or, most often, ignoring combatants and civilians on the other side altogether. Visiting sites across the United States, Southeast Asia, and Korea, Viet Thanh Nguyen provides penetrating interpretations of the way memories of the war help to enable future wars or struggle to prevent them.</p><p>Drawing from this war, Nguyen offers a lesson for all wars by calling on us to recognize not only our shared humanity but our ever-present inhumanity. This is the only path to reconciliation with our foes, and with ourselves. Without reconciliation, war&#x2019;s truth will be impossible to remember, and war&#x2019;s trauma impossible to forget.</p></p><p>Viet Thanh Nguyen is Aerol Arnold Chair of English and Professor of English and American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California. His novel <i>The Sympathizer</i> won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.&#x201c;[Nguyen] produces close readings of the novels, films, monuments, and prisons that form &#x2018;the identity of war&#x2019; in Vietnam, &#x2018;a face with carefully drawn features, familiar at a glance to the nation&#x2019;s people.&#x2019; Nguyen draws insights from Levinas, Ricoeur, and other philosophers, and his approach has affinities with that of hybridists such as W. G. Sebald and Maggie Nelson. The book is also notable for its inclusivity, addressing Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, and Korean experiences and the competition for narrative dominance in bookstores and box offices.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>New Yorker</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Nothing Ever Dies</i>, Nguyen has written a powerful meditation on the manner in which memories are produced, cultivated, even empowered and subdued...He&#x2019;s a lucid and robust voice for the forgotten&#x2015;forgotten people, forgotten places, and forgotten memories most of all...<i>Nothing Ever Dies</i> is one man&#x2019;s powerful entreaty to a country which has seen nearly endless conflict (one war running upon the next) for generations.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Matthew Snider</b><b>, </b><b><i>PopMatters</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Readers will discover the roots of Nguyen&#x2019;s powerful fiction in this profoundly incisive and bracing investigation into the memory of war and how war stories are shaped and disseminated...Ultimately, Nguyen&#x2019;s lucid, arresting, and richly sourced inquiry, in the mode of Susan Sontag and W. G. Sebald, is a call for true and just stories of war and its perpetual legacy.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Donna Seaman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Booklist (starred review)</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Nguyen&#x2019;s work is a powerful reflection on how we choose to remember and forget.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This thought-provoking book is recommended for all students of the Vietnam War and those interested in historical memory.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joshua Wallace</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[An] eloquent...narrative of the Vietnam War&#x2019;s psychological impact on combatants and civilians...This is primarily a work that comes to grips with memory and identity through the arts...Nguyen succeeds in delivering a potent critique of the war and revealing what the memories of living have meant for the identities of the next generation.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Is there hope for an ethics of memory, or for peace? <i>Nothing Ever Dies</i> reveals that, in our collective memories of conflict, we are still fighting the Forever War. Nguyen&#x2019;s distinctive voice blends ideas with family history in a way that is original, unique, exciting. A vitally important book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Maxine Hong Kingston, author of <i>To Be a Poet</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Inspired by the author&#x2019;s personal odyssey, informed by his wide-ranging exploration of literature, film, and art, this is a provocative and moving meditation on the ethics of remembering and forgetting. Rooted in the Vietnam War and its aftermath, it speaks to all who have been displaced by war and revolution, and carry with them memories, whether their own or of others, private or collective, that are freighted with nostalgia, guilt, and trauma.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Hue-Tam Ho Tai, editor of <i>The Country of Memory: Remaking the Past in Late Socialist Vietnam</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Nothing Ever Dies</i> provides the fullest and best explanation of how the Vietnam War has become so deeply inscribed into national memory.

Young, author of <i>The Vietnam Wars, 1945-1990</i></b></p><h2>Ex Libris: The Art of Bookplates</h2><p>A bookplate, or Ex Libris, is a small print for pasting inside the cover of a book to express ownership. The first books were highly valuable and prestigious objects to own, hence the first bookplates usually incorporated the decorative coats of arms of the fabulously wealthy. By the late nineteenth century, bookplates had developed into a highly imaginative form of the engravers and printmakers art in miniature. This delightful book showcases bookplates drawn from the rich collections of the British Museum, including works created by some of the most talented artists of their day, such as Albrecht Du rer, Edward Burne-Jones, Aubrey Beardsley and Eric Gill. Equally it shows how the content of bookplates has evolved over the years to feature a vast range of allegory and symbolism often incorporating a pun on the owners name uniquely relevant to that individual. For example, the bookplate for a professor of Sanskrit features Hindu imagery, while a Venetian publisher is associated with a lion, the symbol of his city. Endlessly diverse, surprising and touching, this is a book that will be treasured by art-lovers and book-lovers alike.</p><p><b>Martin Hopkinson</b>, formerly Curator of Prints at the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, is an art critic and writer.&#x201c;An excellent book...[showing] a diverse selection of bookplates from the collection of the British Library, some of which have never been reproduced before.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Dorfman, <i>Art and Antiques</i> (John Dorfman <i>Arts and Antiques</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Exquisite...In a year when we are contemplating the future of the printed word, a collection that celebrates the physical book and its connection to the reader is a particular treat.&#x201d;&#x2014;NPR.org (<i>NPR.org</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;If there&#x2019;s such a thing as bookplate porn, this gorgeous book is the ultimate.&#x201d;&#x2014;Sadie Stein, <i>The Paris Review</i> (Sadie Stein <i>The Paris Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;I reckon that the plates in this slim, richly illustrated volume may inspire another resurgence &#x2014; perhaps in digital form.&#x201d;&#x2014;Steven Heller, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> (Steven Heller <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;An easy gift for any booklover on your list.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Fine Books and Collections</i> (<i>Fine Books and Collections</i>)</p><h2>Native Universe: Voices of Indian America</h2><p>This gorgeous volume draws from the vast archives of the National Museum of the American Indian and the voices of some of the most prominent Native American scholars, writers, activists and tribal leaders. More than 300 full-color illustrations depict the artistry and culture of our hemisphere&#x2019;s diverse indigenous peoples. With its insightful, firsthand prose, the book is a reminder that the ancient philosophies and folkways are just as valuable and relevant in today&#x2019;s world as they were generations ago.</p><p>Geral McMaster (Plains Cree), formerly deputy assistant director for cultural resources for the Smithsonian&#x2019;s National Museum of the American Indian, is curator of Canadian art at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He is also the author of numerous books and articles.<br><br>Clifford E. Trafzer, of Wyandot ancestry, is a multiple award-winning author. He is professor of history and director of American Indian Studies at the University of California, Riverside.Published for the September 21 opening of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian on Washington Mall, the three main sections of this majestic book ("Our Universes," "Our Peoples" and "Our Lives") feature more than 300 color illustrations of Native artworks, from Inka to Iroquois, with poems by N. Scott Momaday, Louise Erdrich, Linda Hogan and others; extensive essays on Native mythology, history and identity; and even an excerpt from the Sherman Alexie script for <i>Smoke Signals</i>. The essays, which range from straightforward histories to deeply felt testimonials, are written by a wide range of Native cultural personages, including Wilma Mankiller (the first woman to be elected by the Cherokee Nation as its principal chief), Gabrielle Tayac (daughter of medicine man Chief Turkey Tayac in the Chesapeake Bay region) and Vine Deloria Jr., author of <i>Custer Died for Your Sins</i>. Despite the very generous and impressive selection of art, which even includes three multipage "Portfolios" of ancient, historical and contemporary Native artwork, the visual aspect of the book inevitably comes in second. This is not entirely the editors' fault: the intricacy and incredible range of Native artwork, which here includes both South and North American art, is simply too enormous to share space equally with the absorbing writing.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For two years, a small, daring band of Americans fed more than ten million men, women, and children across a million square miles of territory. It was the largest humanitarian operation in history&#x2015;preventing the loss of countless lives, social unrest on a massive scale, and, quite possibly, the collapse of the communist state. </p><p>Now, almost a hundred years later, few in either America or Russia have heard of the ARA. The Soviet government quickly began to erase the memory of American charity. In America, fanatical anti-communism would eclipse this historic cooperation with the Soviet Union. Smith resurrects the American relief mission from obscurity, taking the reader on an unforgettable journey from the heights of human altruism to the depths of human depravity. The story of the ARA is filled with political intrigue, espionage, the clash of ideologies, violence, adventure, and romance, and features some of the great historical figures of the twentieth century. </p><p>In a time of cynicism and despair about the world&#x2019;s ability to confront international crises, <i>The Russian Job</i> is a riveting account of a cooperative effort unmatched before or since.</p></p><p><b>Douglas Smith </b>is an award-winning historian and translator and the author of <i>Rasputin</i> and <i>Former People</i>, which was a bestseller in the U.K. His books have been translated into a dozen languages. The recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, he has written for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and has appeared in documentaries with the BBC, National Geographic, and Netflix. Before becoming a historian, he worked for the U.S. State Department in the Soviet Union and as a Russian affairs analyst for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. He lives with his family in Seattle.<p><b>A <i>Financial Times </i>Best Book of the Year</b></p><p>&#x201c;These young men [of the ARA] come to life in Smith&#x2019;s book, flickering past like characters in the black-and-white movies of the era. Their heroism and failings, their love of Russia (and Russian women) help humanize a story that could all too easily slip into the grim abstraction of statistics . . . Despite the epic sweep, the horror and moral splendor of this story, it is essentially unknown to both Russians and Americans; the Russians soon found the aid both a humiliation and a cover for espionage, while the Americans let it slip into the country&#x2019;s general ahistorical amnesia.&#x201d; &#x2015;Richard Lourie, <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Russian Job</i> by Douglas Smith repudiates the modern mythologies of both [the United States and Russia], and their leaders&#x2019; twisted histories . . . It is not just Russia that needs to be reminded of this story&#x2015;so does America, which derived much of its 20th-century greatness from its values rather than military power.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Economist</i></p><p>&#x201c;[The ARA] has been undeservedly forgotten . . .

Rare photos included in the book lend Smith&#x2019;s account an eerie vividness." &#x2015;Maria Lipman, <i>Foreign Affairs</i></p><p>"The hair-raising account of a great humanitarian act . . . Smith adeptly navigates all elements of the story . . . This expert account deserves a large readership." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i></p><p>"[Smith's] prose moves at a fast clip . . . An intriguing window onto the humanitarian work of the past." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"In July 1921, a massive humanitarian mission was initiated by American philanthropist Herbert Hoover to rescue the Russian people from a famine of cataclysmic proportions. <i>The Russian Job </i>pulls no punches in its brilliant, disturbing and at times horrifically graphic descriptions of people on the abyss of starvation, some of them driven to the ultimate crime of cannibalism. The sufferings witnessed by the American team were unimaginable and left an indelible impression that would haunt them for the rest of their lives. This is an important story that needed to be told and Douglas Smith has produced a fast moving and most compelling read." &#x2015;Helen Rappaport, author of <i>The Romanov Sisters: The Lost Lives of the Daughters of Nicholas and Alexandra</i></p></p><h2>Colonial Pathologies: American Tropical Medicine, Race, and Hygiene in the Philippines</h2><p><i>Colonial Pathologies</i> is a groundbreaking history of the role of science and medicine in the American colonization of the Philippines from 1898 through the 1930s. Warwick Anderson describes how American colonizers sought to maintain their own health and stamina in a foreign environment while exerting control over and &#x201c;civilizing&#x201d; a population of seven million people spread out over seven thousand islands. In the process, he traces a significant transformation in the thinking of colonial doctors and scientists about what was most threatening to the health of white colonists. During the late nineteenth century, they understood the tropical environment as the greatest danger, and they sought to help their fellow colonizers to acclimate. Later, as their attention shifted to the role of microbial pathogens, colonial scientists came to view the Filipino people as a contaminated race, and they launched public health initiatives to reform Filipinos&#x2019; personal hygiene practices and social conduct.<p></p><p>A vivid sense of a colonial culture characterized by an anxious and assertive white masculinity emerges from Anderson&#x2019;s description of American efforts to treat and discipline allegedly errant Filipinos. His narrative encompasses a colonial obsession with native excrement, a leper colony intended to transform those considered most unclean and least socialized, and the hookworm and malaria programs implemented by the Rockefeller Foundation in the 1920s and 1930s. Throughout, Anderson is attentive to the circulation of intertwined ideas about race, science, and medicine. He points to colonial public health in the Philippines as a key influence on the subsequent development of military medicine and industrial hygiene, U.S. urban health services, and racialized development regimes in other parts of the world.</p></p><p>&#34;It&#39;s difficult to overstate the significance of this book. Its account of hygiene as the means for establishing &#39;biomedical citizenship&#39; in the Philippines under U.S. rule is carefully crafted and powerfully argued. Sympathetically deconstructing the assertiveness and delusions of white colonial medical practitioners beset by the specters of native bodily excess, Warwick Anderson shows how race and biology defined civic identities in the colony and the metropole alike. A path-breaking work on imperial medicine, it is certain to attract a wide readership.&#34;--Vicente L.

Emphasizing traditional methods of joinery adapted to the use of power tools, this handsome volume covers a dozen furniture projects of classic Shaker and Colonial design. An abundance of high-quality photos and drawings nicely augment the detailed instructions. This seems to be for the more experienced woodworker having access to an especially well-equipped workshop. An introductory chapter, intended to present the basics of tools, joinery techniques, and wood selection, likewise appears far too sketchy for the novice furniture builder.

The Restless Passenger</p> <p>It all came about by pure chance! The previous day, Maigret had not known that he was about to go on a journey, even though it was the time of year when he usually began to find Paris oppressive. It was a March spiced up with a foretaste of spring and a clear, sharp sun that was already warm.</p> <p>Madame Maigret was away in Alsace for a couple of weeks, staying with her sister, who was having a baby.</p> <p>On the Wednesday morning, the inspector received a letter from a former colleague who had retired from the Police Judiciaire two years earlier and moved to the Dordogne.</p> <p> </p><p> <i>... And of course, if you happen to be in the area, do come and stay with me for a few days. I have an elderly housekeeper who is only too happy when there are guests to fuss over. And it&#x2019;s the start of the salmon season&#x2014;</i> </p> <p></p> <p>Maigret&#x2019;s imagination was particularly fired by the letterhead with its drawing of a manor house flanked by two circular towers above the address:</p> <p> </p><p> <i>La Ribaudi�re</i> </p> <p> <i>near Villefranche-en-Dordogne</i> </p> <p></p> <p>At midday, Madame Maigret telephoned from Alsace to say that her sister would probably give birth that night, adding, &#x2018;You&#x2019;d think it was summer ... The fruit trees are in blossom!&#x2019;</p> <p>Chance ... Pure chance ... A little later, Maigret was in the chief&#x2019;s office, chatting, when his superior said, &#x2018;By the way ... Did you ever go to Bordeaux to follow up that matter we talked about?&#x2019;</p> <p>It was a minor case of no urgency. At some point, Maigret had to go to Bordeaux to trawl through the municipal records.</p> <p>One idea led to another: Bordeaux ... the Dordogne.</p> <p>At that exact moment, a ray of sunlight struck the crystal globe paperweight on the chief&#x2019;s desk.</p> <p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s a thought! I&#x2019;m not working on anything at the moment.&#x2019;</p> <p>Later that afternoon, having purchased a first-class ticket to Villefranche, Maigret boarded the train at the Gare d&#x2019;Orsay. The guard reminded him to change trains at Libourne.</p> <p>&#x2018;Unless you&#x2019;re in the sleeper compartment which gets hitched to the connecting train.&#x2019;</p> <p>Maigret thought no more about it, read a few newspapers and made his way to the dining car where he sat until ten o&#x2019;clock.</p> <p>When he returned to his compartment, he found the curtains drawn and the light dimmed. An elderly couple had commandeered both seats.</p> <p>An attendant walked past.</p> <p>&#x2018;Is there a free bunk by any chance?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Not in first-class ... but I think there&#x2019;s one in second ... If you don&#x2019;t mind&#x2014;&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Of course not!&#x2019;</p> <p>And Maigret lugged his carpet-bag along the corridors. The attendant opened several doors and finally found the compartment in which only the upper bunk was taken.</p> <p>Here too, the light was dimmed and the curtains drawn.</p> <p>&#x2018;Would you like me to switch on the light?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;No thank you.&#x2019;</p> <p>The air was warm and stuffy. There was a faint hissing sound, as if there was a leak in the radiator pipes. Maigret could hear the person in the top bunk tossing and turning and breathing heavily.</p> <p>The inspector silently removed his shoes, jacket and waistcoat. He stretched out on the lower bunk and felt a slight draught coming from somewhere. He picked up his bowler hat and put it over his face for protection.</p> <p>Did he fall asleep? He dozed off, in any case. Perhaps for an hour, perhaps two. Perhaps longer. But he remained half conscious.</p> <p>And, in that semi-conscious state, he was aware of a feeling of discomfort. Was it because of the heat battling with the draught?</p> <p>Or was it because of the man in the top bunk, who couldn&#x2019;t keep still for a second? He tossed and turned continually, just above Maigret&#x2019;s head. Every movement made a rustling sound.</p> <p>His breathing was irregular, as if he had a fever.</p> <p>After a time, Maigret got up, exasperated, went into the corridor and paced up and down. But there it was too cold.</p> <p>So it was back into the compartment, and another attempt to sleep, his thoughts and sensations befuddled by drowsiness.</p> <p>Cut off from the rest of the world, the atmosphere was that of a nightmare.</p> <p>Had the man above him just raised himself up on his elbows and leaned over to try and get a look at his companion?</p> <p>Maigret, meanwhile, didn&#x2019;t dare move. The half-bottle of Bordeaux and the two brandies he had drunk in the dining car lay heavy in his stomach.</p> <p>The night was long. Whenever the train stopped at a station, there was a babble of voices, footsteps in the corridors, doors slamming. It felt as if the train would never get going again.</p> <p>It sounded as if the man was crying. There were moments when he held his breath. Then suddenly, there&#x2019;d be a snivel and he would turn over and blow his nose.</p> <p>Maigret regretted leaving his first-class compartment occupied by the elderly couple.</p> <p>He dozed off, woke up and drifted off again. Finally, unable to stand it any longer, he coughed to steady his voice and said, &#x2018;Monsieur, would you kindly try to keep still!&#x2019;</p> <p>He felt embarrassed, because his voice sounded much sterner than he had intended. Supposing the man was ill?</p> <p>There was no answer. The tossing and turning stopped. The man must have been making a huge effort to avoid making the slightest sound. And it suddenly occurred to Maigret that it might not be a man after all, but a woman! He hadn&#x2019;t seen the person who was wedged between the bunk and the ceiling.</p> <p>And the heat must be suffocating up there. Now Maigret tried to turn down the radiator, but the control knob was jammed.</p> <p>It was three o&#x2019;clock in the morning.</p> <p>&#x2018;I really must get some sleep!&#x2019;</p> <p>Now he was wide awake. He had become almost as jumpy as his fellow passenger. He listened out.</p></p><h2>The Ultimate Evil</h2><p>1989 Bantam Books, paperback; 1st edition, Thus; 7th Printing; The Ultimate Evil: An Investigation into a Dangerous Satanic Cult; by Maury Terry.</p><p></p><h2>The God Makers</h2><p>Mormons claim to follow the same God and the same Jesus as Christians.

It has been the seat of a priestly monarchy, a worldly church and the Soviet Union; it has served as a crossroads for diplomacy, trade, and espionage; it has survived earthquakes, devastating fires, and at least three revolutions.

She lives in Oxfordshire, England.<p>Introduction</p> <p>The Kremlin is one of the most famous structures in the world. If states have trademarks, Russia&#x2019;s could well be this fortress, viewed across Red Square. Everyone who comes to Moscow wants to see it, and everyone who visits seems to take a different view. &#x2018;The only guarantee of a correct response is to choose your position before you come,&#x2019; wrote the German philosopher Walter Benjamin. &#x2018;In Russia, you can only see if you have already decided.&#x2019; In 1927, his decision was to be enthralled.1 A hundred years before, however, a Frenchman called the marquis de Custine had opted for a scandalized tirade. To him, the Kremlin was &#x2018;a prop of tyrants&#x2019;, a &#x2018;satanic monument&#x2019;, &#x2018;a habitation that would suit some of the personages of the Apocalypse&#x2019;. &#x2018;Like the bones of certain gigantic animals,&#x2019; he concluded, &#x2018;the Kremlin proves to us the history of a world of which we might doubt until after seeing the remains.&#x2019;2</p> <p>The site still mesmerizes foreign visitors. As the newspaper correspondent Mark Frankland once lamented, &#x2018;there can be few other cities in the world where the feeling is so strong of being carried towards the centre whether one wants it or not.&#x2019;3 &#x2018;Do not forget that people went into some of those buildings and came out blinded,&#x2019; a British government interpreter reminded me.4 When it comes to falling for the magic of the place, however, no outsider competes with the Russians themselves. The Kremlin is the symbol of their nationhood.5 Its walls may not have managed to withstand invading hordes of Mongol horsemen, and they were later breached by Poles and even Frenchmen, but like Russia itself, the citadel endured. Most Russians know that it was here, outside the Kremlin gates, that Stalin reviewed the fresh Red Army troops as they marched off to fight and die in 1941. Less than four years later, in steady early summer rain, the same iconic walls and towers looked down on rank upon rank of marching men. As Marshal Zhukov struggled to control a tetchy thoroughbred horse, the banners of two hundred vanquished Nazi regiments were hurled on to the gleaming stones beside the steps of Lenin&#x2019;s mausoleum. The country&#x2019;s second capital, St Petersburg, may be an architectural miracle, but the Kremlin is Russia&#x2019;s wailing wall.</p> <p>The structure is not democratic. Built from specially hardened bricks, the walls of this red fortress were designed for war. Although they are so elegant that the fact is disguised, they are also exceptionally thick &#x2013; honeycombed by a warren of stairs and corridors that feels like a city in itself &#x2013; and in places they rise more than sixty feet above the surrounding land. The four main gates are made of ancient Russian oak, but their venerable iron locks have long been superseded by the pitiless systems of a digital age. Even now, the Kremlin is a military compound, managed by a person called the commandant, and its subterranean maze of tunnels and control-rooms is designed to survive a nuclear strike. There is no public access to the north-east quarter where the president&#x2019;s building stands. On Thursdays, in a tradition that dates from the era of the Communist Politburo, the entire site is closed, and it is also sealed, these days, at the first whiff of public disorder. But beauty of the most transcendent kind has flourished in this atmosphere of menace. The Kremlin&#x2019;s spired silhouette is crowned by its religious buildings, and the most entrancing of these are clustered like so many jewel-boxes round a single square. From almost any point on this historic ground, the eye will be drawn upwards from the white stones to an effulgence of coloured tile and on to the cascades of gilded domes that lead yet higher, up among the wheeling Moscow crows, to a dazzling procession of three-barred Orthodox crosses. The tallest towers are visible for miles around, standing white and gold above the city. Magnificent and lethal, holy and yet secretive, the fortress is indeed an incarnation of the legendary Russian state.</p> <p>Its spell depends on an apparent timelessness. History is everywhere. The Dormition Cathedral, which is the oldest and most famous sacred building on the site, has witnessed every coronation since the days of Ivan the Terrible. Across the square, in the Cathedral of the Archangel Michael, most visitors can barely squeeze between the waist-high caskets that hold the remains of almost every Moscow prince from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries. In the reign of the last tsar, a nationalist court administration had forty-six of the carved stone coffins covered in uniform bronze casings, row upon sombre row, reinforcing the impression of unbroken lineage. By then the shifting of the capital to St Petersburg had long put an end to royal Kremlin burials, but the coronations continued until 1896, and each was followed by a banquet. The fifteenth-century Faceted Palace, where the royal diners gathered in a blaze of diamonds and gold, still graces the western margin of Cathedral Square. Towering behind it, the vast Grand Palace is a nineteenth-century pastiche, but anyone who ventures past the armed police will come upon the curving stair, mutely guarded by stone lions, that leads up to the older royal quarters and the churches that were carefully preserved within. Like Jerusalem, Rome, or Istanbul, the Kremlin is a place where history is concentrated, and every stone seems to embody several pasts. The effect is hypnotic.</p> <p>It is also deliberately contrived. There is nothing accidental about the Kremlin&#x2019;s current appearance, from the chaos of its golden roofline to the overwhelming mass of palaces and ancient walls. Someone designed these shapes to celebrate the special character of Russian culture, and someone else approved the plans to go on building in a style that would suggest historically rooted power. The ubiquitous gold, in Orthodox iconography, may be a reminder of eternity, but for the rest of us it is also an impressive reflection of earthly wealth. From the churches and forbidding gates to the familiar spires that are its emblem, the Kremlin is not merely home to Russia&#x2019;s rulers. It is also a theatre and a text, a gallery that displays and embodies the current governing idea. That &#x2013; and the incongruity of its survival in the heart of modern Moscow &#x2013; has long been the secret of its magnetism.</p> <p>I have been fascinated by the place since I first saw it three decades ago, and its story has seemed to acquire an ever-deeper resonance. A turning point came in 2007, towards the end of Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s second four-year term as president, a time when the question of his future was beginning to preoccupy the Russian press. In true arch-nationalist style, his supporters had begun to justify an unconstitutional third term by drawing on the supposed lessons of the past. They argued that the Russian nation had endured because it followed special rules. The people suffered most when there was weakness at the heart of power. The national genius took a unique creative form, they said, and it could flourish only when it was protected by a strong and centralizing state. Obliging textbook-writers duly came up with historical proof. From Peter the Great to Stalin, and from the bigoted Alexander III to Putin himself, the past showed just why Russia still needed a firm governing hand. Even doubters were aware that the alternative was risky. Weak government was something every Russian knew about, for the most recent case had been Boris Yeltsin&#x2019;s presidency in the 1990s, a time of national humiliation and desperate human misery. The statist message therefore fell on willing ears. In a poll to find the greatest name in Russian history, organized by the Rossiya television channel in 2008, the implacably reactionary Nicholas I took an early lead, and Stalin followed close behind in second place.6</p> <p>The result came as no surprise to Russia-watchers in the west. If any thing, there was a depressing inevitability about it, as if the country were indeed eternally marked out for tyranny. Outsiders had been saying as much for centuries. &#x2018;The prince alone controls everything,&#x2019; a Jesuit envoy decided in the 1580s. &#x2018;The deference accorded the Prince is something the mind can scarcely comprehend.&#x2019;7 A succession of Englishmen who reported on Moscow in the reigns of Elizabeth and James I agreed.8 More than three hundred years later, when the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 turned into a dictatorship, expert onlookers were ready with a range of theories based on Russia&#x2019;s special path.9 It was the same when the reforms of perestroika faltered under Gorbachev. As one political scientist put it at the time: &#x2018;too much freedom makes many Russians feel uncomfortable.&#x2019;10 This sort of commentary flatters western prejudice, which is why it has persisted through so many complete changes of regime. In the end, however, the idea that Russia has a special destiny has survived because it suits the government of Russia itself. As a recent book on the subject neatly stated, &#x2018;the statist interpretation of Russian history is a justification for unaccountability and an absolution of past crimes&#x2019;.11 By using history, in the words of another writer, even the current government can &#x2018;integrate itself with the traditions of the past&#x2019;, casting the state itself as &#x2018;a focus of social and private life, in a way an ultimate justification for the life of the individual&#x2019;.12</p> <p>The Kremlin is an ideal site from which to think about all this. It is a place where myths are born, the stage on which the Russian state parades its power and its pedigree. But the fortress is also a character in its own right. I set out to explore its past because I wanted to know more about the present day, but in the end I found myself absorbed in its biography. It is a tale where show and fable often triumph over substance, but it is also very much about real things. In writing it, I have had to think about the stories rulers tell about themselves, and I have also had to master subjects ranging from the ideology behind the coronation ritual to the intricacies of Orthodox Christian theology. At the same time, however, I have found myself reading about clock-mechanisms, cannon-foundries and the technicalities of restoring old plaster. The story covers many cultures and at least two continents. In tracing it, I have looked to the grasslands of the east to follow the evolution of armies that began life on the Asian steppe, and I have also tried to picture the ride across forest and marsh that brought so many European craftsmen to Moscow&#x2019;s solemn, chilly, ritual-bound court. Each time the Kremlin was destroyed (it was not as eternal as it seemed), I have tried to discover how its masters saw the task of rebuilding and repossessing it. The French historian of places, Pierre Nora, would certainly have called the citadel a &#x2018;site of memory&#x2019;, but it has also been a place of action and change, a theatre where the dramas have been about the present even when they were disguised as evocations of the past.</p> <p>I soon confirmed that the idea of predestined continuity was very old. I also came to understand how the familiar stories were conceived. From monks to court scribes and from Soviet propagandists to Putin&#x2019;s favourite textbook-writers, there is nothing unusual in the idea that Russian courtiers should edit entire chapters of the past. They have usually done it in a calculated attempt to secure the authority of history in the name of a specific person, for the Russian state, far from enjoying stable and continuous leadership, has in fact suffered frequent crises at the heart of power. From princes and tsars to general secretaries and unelected presidents, many of its rulers have had only the slenderest of claims. To fend off chaos or potential civil war, therefore, their courts have worked to create a more or less convincing series of succession myths. Some appealed to religion, others invoked the people&#x2019;s will, but history has been the basis of almost everyone&#x2019;s tale. Ivan the Terrible&#x2019;s advisors were among the most assiduous when it came to rewriting the old records &#x2013; he was accorded divine authority as well as a fabulous pedigree &#x2013; and their successors in the seventeenth century did the same job for the first Romanov tsars. The Bolsheviks, despite their modernizing rhetoric, called on the blessing of a pantheon of dead heroes; they also made full use of the symbolic possibilities of the Kremlin itself. Through crisis after crisis, the immediate circumstances were so troubled that the people, for their part, were prepared to welcome even an implausible pretender if they believed that he conformed to a nostalgic, almost fairytale, ideal. Life was so hard, and every future so precarious, that even the most ordinary peasant craved the certainties of vanished times. &#x2018;The highest good in Muscovy was not knowledge but memory,&#x2019; James Billington decided half a century ago. &#x2018;There was no higher appeal in a dispute than the &#x201c;important good and firm memory&#x201d; of the oldest available authority.&#x2019;13</p> <p>But memory, as we all know, is mutable. The Kremlin itself is a record of the past. It is also a sacred place, and its buildings once marked Moscow&#x2019;s holiest sites. The rituals that formed round them, from celebrations of divine liturgy to coronations and royal funerals, were originally designed to embody the truth of a religious timelessness. Even in the age of saints, however, the ceremonial changed and mutated. From generation to generation, the meaning of the same words and the same processions evolved into radically new shapes. The buildings also did not stand unaltered, and they could be the most treacherous witnesses of all. If a wall was repainted, or a palace knocked down and rebuilt, it was as if its previous incarnation had never been. The cycle of familiar prayers returned, with lines of icon-bearing priests and courtiers in golden robes, but the setting had been modified so completely that it encouraged entirely new ideas, and (for want of a better term) false memories. With buildings, which are so concrete, the only past is what is there right now. It was a lesson that the Bolsheviks put to dramatic use when they destroyed the Kremlin&#x2019;s ancient monasteries in 1929. As I would find, few people, even Muscovites, can now say where the buildings stood. Some even doubt that they existed, scratching their heads over the old photographs that prove the case.</p> <p>This book, then, is about the Kremlin over centuries of time, but it is also very much about the Kremlin now. As I began to work on it, I quickly discovered the benefits of an association &#x2013; even an unreciprocated one &#x2013; with Russia&#x2019;s ultimate elite. Although the Kremlin&#x2019;s research staff work in conditions that are worse, if anything, than those of any university historian outside the walls, the general environment is spectacular. As I waved my hard-won cardboard pass at the armed guards at the Borovitsky Gate and swept past queues of early-bird tourists, I tasted the superiority that fellows of Oxford and Cambridge colleges surely enjoy every working day. I left the Moscow smog and traffic noise behind. Inside the walls, before the tour-groups really start, there is a pleasant quiet, and even now, in that land of diesel and cigarettes, the breeze carries a subtle perfume of incense. The library that I was heading for was high up, too, in an annex to the bell tower of Ivan the Great, which leaves the team who runs it without an inch of free space but means the crowds stay very far away.</p> <p>Any sense of membership is relative, however, for this is not a normal research site. In the Kremlin, a visitor will see what she is meant to see. Locked doors are waiting even for the most persistent guest. To write this book, I had to travel well beyond that tower reading-room.

Mystery Guild Main, Lit Guild Feat Alt, &amp; Doubleday Alt. Tour.</p><p>Sharyn McCrumb is one of the major wonders of the mystery world. Her books about forensic anthropologist Elizabeth MacPherson (including <i>Highland Laddie Gone</i>) are strong, meaty contemporary stories; her comic novels (<i>Bimbos of the Death Sun</i>, <i>Zombies of the Gene Pool</i>) are delightful satires. And then there's the jewel in her crown, the series known as the Ballad novels (including <i>The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter</i> and <i>The Rosewood Casket</i>) where the third-generation Appalachian resident McCrumb sews together what she calls "colored scraps of legends, ballads and fragments of rural life and local tragedy" into books that are like Appalachian quilts. <i>The Ballad of Frankie Silver</i> is the fifth in the Ballad series, and it might well be the best. The blend between the old story and the new is perfect, as Sheriff Spencer Arrowood digs into the 1832 case of the first woman ever hanged for murder in North Carolina--18-year-old Frankie Silver, charged with dismembering her husband--while some disturbing new evidence is surfacing about another, much more recent capital crime.

From that auspicious start, the family and its eponymous company would go on to &#x201c;build the world,&#x201d; from the construction of airports in Hong Kong and Doha, to pipelines and tunnels in Alaska and Europe, to mining and energy operations around the globe.<br> <br>Today Bechtel is one of the largest privately held corporations in the world, enriched and empowered by a long history of government contracts and the privatization of public works, made possible by an unprecedented revolving door between its San Francisco headquarters and Washington.

The fifth in a family of eight children, he was raised on a hardscrabble farm near Freeport, Illinois. His parents&#x2014;Elizabeth Bentz and John Moyer Bechtel&#x2014;were descendants of pioneer Pennsylvania German families. When he was twelve, his parents moved to Peabody, Kansas, where they eked out a living &#x201c;at a time when he saw many men missing an arm or a leg from service in the Civil War,&#x201d; as one account described the setting.<br> <br>It was a backbreaking childhood that he fantasized about escaping from an early age. Because he was tasked with farm chores since he was a toddler, Warren&#x2019;s schooling was confined to the winter months when the crops lay beneath frozen ground. Like many of his contemporaries, he hated farming as only a farmer&#x2019;s son can, but he disliked the classroom with equal fervor. Still, his father, who was also a grocery store proprietor, insisted that he finish high school. In 1887 the first railroad came through the area, and during the summers, Warren hired himself out to the construction crews to learn grading and machinery. He also worked for neighboring ranchers, branding cattle and driving herds. But his passion was the slide trombone, which he practiced while roaming the land. He dreamed of playing the instrument professionally.<br> <br>Upon graduation at the age of nineteen, he hit the road with an ensemble of performers who called themselves the Ladies Band. He hoped music would spare him a future in farming. &#x201c;Either the music of the ladies&#x2019; band was very bad or the Western audiences were lacking in appreciation,&#x201d; the New York Times would later describe the venture. &#x201c;The troupe came to grief in Lewiston, Ill., and the young slide-trombonist was stranded.&#x201d; Disheartened, he returned home to the unwelcome plow to raise corn for livestock feed. He remained there until 1897, when he became infatuated with a slender brunette named Clara Alice West. She was visiting relatives in nearby Peabody. After a fleeting courtship that alarmed her affluent Indiana parents, the two married, and Warren ventured into the cattle business. He embarked on his scheme to fatten Arizona draught steers as they awaited slaughter in the Kansas stockyards. But the bottom dropped out of both the corn and cattle markets to record lows at the end of the nineteenth century, leaving the newlyweds bankrupt. With their infant firstborn son, Warren Jr., their personal possessions, a slip grader, and two mules, they struck out for Indian Territory, where the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company was putting new lines westward from Chickasha in what is now Oklahoma.<br> <br>Earning $2.75 per day&#x2014;a good living for a man with his own mule team&#x2014;Warren found the work plentiful, as rail companies were expanding westward with boomtown gusto. His nascent construction company consisted mostly of muscle and ambition. As the railways forged west, so too did the little Bechtel family, with Warren grading track beds in Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, and Wyoming. Though a rugged and itinerant existence, the couple was optimistic, and welcomed the birth of their second son, Stephen Davison, while visiting Clara&#x2019;s parents in Aurora, Indiana.<br> <br>When he was offered a job as gang foreman with the Southern Pacific Railroad in Reno, Nevada, during the winter of 1902&#x2013;03, Warren was grateful for the opportunity. Eager for a more secure financial position, he had set his sights on the West Coast and the post&#x2013;Gold Rush promise that existed in California. Warren embraced newspaperman Horace Greeley&#x2019;s famous 1871 career advice to a young correspondent: &#x201c;Having mastered these, gather up your family and Go West!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I landed in Reno with a wife and two babies, a slide trombone, and a ten-dollar bill,&#x201d; Warren later recalled. The railroad supervisor who had promised him the job had gone bust. Twenty-seven years old, Warren lived with his wife and small sons in a converted railroad boxcar. Discouraged, he hitched a ride on a buckboard to Wadsworth, Nevada&#x2014;a remote railroad site on the banks of the Truckee River known for its wild mustang herd and native Paiute population. He found a job there as an estimator for the Southern Pacific, earning $59 a month. &#x201c;He was learning all the time, but he seemed to me a natural engineer,&#x201d; his supervisor later recalled. An engineer who worked with him during those early days described him as &#x201c;a horse-drawn fresno-scraper type of contractor&#x201d;&#x2014;meaning an old-fashioned laborer who had come up the hard way on the railroad construction gangs.<br> <br>A series of jobs ensued from which Warren acquired technical experience in lieu of a formal education. From Wadsworth, he moved to Lovelock, Nevada, where he became a gravel pit superintendent at a quarry. He, his wife, and two young sons were a familiar sight at the primitive migrant job sites. He soon acquired the nickname &#x201c;Dad,&#x201d; as his ubiquitous brood called him. He bounced around various posts, gaining a reputation for efficiency and, especially, for mastering the newfangled modern transportation and construction equipment&#x2014;most conspicuously the giant excavating machine called the steam shovel. &#x201c;Many of the old-timers were reluctant to have anything to do with the big, belching mechanized monsters,&#x201d; according to one account, &#x201c;but Bechtel put them to immediate&#x2014;and profitable&#x2014;use.&#x201d; That specialty brought him to the attention of an inspector for a construction firm, based in Oakland, California, that had a contract to build the Richmond Belt Railroad and to extend the Santa Fe line into Oakland.<br> <br>In 1904 Dad moved his family to Oakland, where a third son, Kenneth, was born. The city, named for the massive oak forest that dominated the landscape, was surrounded by redwoods, farmland, and rural settlements. Even then a sad relative to booming, raucous San Francisco, located six miles west across the San Francisco Bay, the city&#x2019;s future as Northern California&#x2019;s busiest seaport was not yet apparent. Still, its sunny and mild Mediterranean climate lured an increasing number of immigrants from throughout the country, and its population (eighty-two thousand upon the Bechtels&#x2019; arrival) would double in just six years. A few blocks away from their Linden Street home, tracks of the interurban electric line to San Francisco were being laid. Dad had the contract to fill the swamp at the head of Lake Merritt for Oakland&#x2019;s Lakeshore Park.<br> <br>By 1906, Dad was ready to strike out on his own. At thirty-four years old, he obtained his first subcontract with the Western Pacific Railroad, building a line between Pleasanton and Sunol. This independent undertaking marked the birth of the modern Bechtel company. Dad began assembling the team of colleagues that would help him make construction history. For an extortionate fee, he rented the impressive Model 20 Marion steam shovel that had been memorably developed for the Panama Canal construction. When he purchased the imposing machine, thanks to a loan from his well-to-do father-in-law, his company was officially launched. His steam shovel was in great demand, and he undertook ever-larger railroad projects while expanding into building roads, tunnels, bridges, and dams. In large white block script, he stenciled &#x201c;W. A. BECHTEL CO.&#x201d; onto the red cab door. It would be another sixteen years before he would formally incorporate his business. Home now to a family of five, their residential boxcar was called WaaTeeKaa for the combination of their three toddlers&#x2019; baby names: &#x201c;Waa-Waa&#x201d; for Warren, &#x201c;Tee-Tee&#x201d; for Steve, and &#x201c;Kaa-Kaa&#x201d; for Kenneth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Still largely undeveloped, California was booming&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and, with the recent addition of the steam engine, railroads couldn&#x2019;t lay track fast enough to link the new west to the rest of the country,&#x201d; a newspaper described the moment. A man of unlimited ambition, Dad expanded his vision to the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, where he came into contact with the imposing and pugnacious sheep-ranching Wattis brothers of Ogden, Utah. W. H. and E. O. Wattis were the founders and chief executives of the Utah Construction Company&#x2014;one of the great railroad construction firms of the West&#x2014;who were devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The sons of a forty-niner &#x201c;whose trek to California ended six hundred miles short in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. northern Utah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they were reared in the dynamic, enterprising environment of Brigham Young&#x2019;s Mormon commonwealth,&#x201d; wrote historian Joseph E. Stevens. They were notoriously reluctant to work with non-Mormon &#x201c;gentiles.&#x201d; But they admired Dad&#x2019;s abilities and resourcefulness and, as W.H. reportedly put it to his brother: &#x201c;Might as well ask him in as to have him bitin&#x2019; our feet.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Wattis brothers wielded extraordinary political power in Utah. David Eccles, patriarch of the single largest Mormon fortune, leading tither to the church, and the father of Marriner Eccles, who would later become chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, supplied most of their capital. (The Eccleses&#x2019; formidable Utah Corporation was an international conglomerate of mining, shipping, and construction involved in the production of iron, coal, and uranium ore on three continents.) The Wattises gave Bechtel his most lucrative jobs to date: three large contracts for railroad lines in Northern California and central Utah. His work with the Northwestern Pacific Railroad required more sophisticated construction techniques, and he became the first contractor in the country to replace the horse- and mule-drawn freight teams with chain-driven, gasoline-powered dump trucks. At a yard in San Leandro, he retrofitted 1912 model Packards and Alcos with dump bodies. Referred to later as the &#x201c;coming of age&#x201d; period for the Bechtel organization, the completion of the last 106-mile stretch of the Northwestern Pacific line signaled the beginning of the company&#x2019;s rise. &#x201c;I never expected to have that much money in a lifetime,&#x201d; the unlettered son of a small-town grocer confided to a friend upon receiving his nearly $500,000 payment.<br> <br>Now flush, he turned his attention to family&#x2014;which included daughter Alice Elizabeth, born in 1912&#x2014;purchasing a spacious Victorian home and furnishing it lavishly with rare Oriental rugs that had been exhibited at the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. He chose the Estudillo Avenue house in nearby San Leandro, where the children would have &#x201c;more room to grow.&#x201d; Evocative of his farm upbringing, the house was surrounded by acres of tomatoes and elaborate flower gardens. A tennis court on the grounds affirmed the family&#x2019;s fresh wealth.<br> <br>But just as the official history of the company smooths over the &#x201c;near misses, the bad judgment calls, and the numerous failures&#x201d; of Dad&#x2019;s early climb&#x2014;as an academic critique of the corporate culture of Bechtel portrayed his dismal performance in the cattle, farming, and grading enterprises, not to mention the nomadic lifestyle to which he subjected his young family&#x2014;so too are his subsequent fiascos whitewashed. &#x201c;It is difficult to connect the sober-headed, hard-working straight-shooter depicted in the official history with the man whose main ambition on leaving home, for instance, was to play the slide trombone with a largely female dance band,&#x201d; wrote Canadian postcolonialist professor Heather Zwicker.<br> <br>Despite the revisionist and mythologizing company narrative of Warren A. Bechtel&#x2019;s entrepreneurial individualism&#x2014;the American exceptionalism that would be much ballyhooed by later generations of Bechtels&#x2014;in the years following the Northwestern Pacific windfall, Dad made a string of bad calls. Smug with his newfound success, &#x201c;and still fancying himself the wheeler-dealer of his youth,&#x201d; according to Friends in High Places: The Bechtel Story&#x2014;The Most Secret Corporation and How It Engineered the World, by Laton McCartney, he sank tens of thousands of dollars into an unsuccessful Oregon gold mine, followed by several hundred thousand more invested in a folding toothbrush company that tanked. The salvation of his fortune and future would lie not in the up-from-the-bootstraps chronicle that would become family legend, but with the US government. With government patronage, Bechtel was able to build a network of tracks and highways throughout the land at the very moment that railroad expansion and the automobile industry were exploding.<br> <br>Sales of Henry Ford&#x2019;s iconic black Model Ts had passed the five hundred thousand mark by 1918&#x2014;giving the Ford Motor Company a veritable monopoly, as a Ford was driven by more than half the car owners in America. Dad was not alone in recognizing that all of these cars needed roads to travel on, but he was among a handful of California builders positioned to capitalize on the new construction market. The Federal Aid Road Act had been approved in 1916 to meet the overwhelming demand, resulting in the creation of the US Bureau of Public Roads. Bechtel lobbied for a role, and in 1919 received the first federal highway contract in California. He first built the Klamath River Highway near the Oregon border; the scenic byway, considered an engineering marvel at the time, jutted through volcanic rock and granite. The following year, he built another highway for the federal government in Los Angeles County that ran through the rugged San Gabriel Canyon; this one required a bluff to be blasted down with the rarely used powerful explosive, picric powder. Next was the Generals Highway in Sequoia National Park, named after the largest, most famous giant sequoia trees&#x2014;General Sherman and General Grant&#x2014;and famous for its steep, often-impassable switchbacks. Then came the job of making additions and improvements to the highway system in Yosemite National Park, followed by contracts in New Mexico and Arizona to double track the Santa Fe Railroad from Gallup to Chambers.<br> <br>Dad, fleshy and always well groomed, gained a reputation for keeping his jobs orderly and his equipment in top condition. He espoused a &#x201c;cleanliness is next to godliness&#x201d; motto. He wore a trademark felt fedora and gold watch fob, and his dapper style set him apart from the workers on his many sites. Known for his hearty appetite, he hired the finest cooks and bakers he could find to accompany him to his worksites. Since his California labor force was composed mostly of what he called &#x201c;eye-talians,&#x201d; his cooks became expert at cooking spaghetti, for which Dad acquired a penchant. A stickler for verbal agreements and handshake deals with his associates&#x2014;&#x201c;When you can&#x2019;t trust a man&#x2019;s word, you can&#x2019;t trust his signature,&#x201d; he would declare&#x2014;he also insisted on fifty-fifty partnerships. &#x201c;Dad had no patience with 51-49 arrangements,&#x201d; a former partner once said. &#x201c;He used to say &#x2018;No man with a sense of self-respect wants to be controlled on that kind of percentage.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>Although the business of road and railroad construction was steady and profitable, Bechtel began turning his attention to oil&#x2014;the coming boom that accompanied the automobile. Predicting a surge in the development of the West&#x2019;s oil and gas resources to meet the energy needs of a growing industrial economy, Bechtel envisioned a network of refineries and pipelines snaking throughout the country. The vision turned out to be prescient, heralding the ...</p><h2>Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time</h2><p>Shipwrecked in a mysterious, unknown land, a scientist and his son stumble upon a world in which humans and dinosaurs coexist.

Here, dinosaurs live in harmony with a colony of humans, made up of other marooned travelers and their descendants. Will and his father are fascinated by the technology of their new home. They visit a hatchery, a blacksmith in Volcaneum, and a city built on waterfalls. The boy is most impressed by the Skybax Riders, people who are trained to fly on winged reptiles. Deciding to join them, he goes through their rigorous training program. In the meantime, his father finds a route to the dinosaur underground, a mythic place referred to in old dinosaur tales. He returns to find his son has ``earned his wings,'' but his discoveries are saved for (one assumes) another book. This fairytale will capture the interests of older fantasy readers--those perhaps, who enjoy the ``Lord of the Rings'' trilogy (Houghton), or Lewis's ``Narnia'' series (Macmillan). Younger readers, too, will be enticed by the dramatic, full-color illustrations, which include both panoramic sweeps of the utopian cities and detailed sketches of Dinotopian contraptions. While the women are more active than their Victorian counterparts, the adventurers here are still Will and Dad. Also, the illustrations tend to portray nonwhite Dinotopians as exotics, a stereotype better left in the past. Overall, the success of this story depends upon readers' ability to accept these creatures as peaceful, intelligent herbivores. Advanced readers who find sharp-toothed carnivores more to their liking may prefer a visit to Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park (Knopf, 1990), for a not-so-tame tale also set on a dinosaur isle. --Cathryn A.

It's a miracle that I survived as long as I did." </p><p>For years, Chen Cao managed to balance the interests of the Communist Party and the promises made by his job. He was both a Chief Inspector of Special Investigations of the Shanghai Police Department and the deputy party secretary of the bureau. He was considered a potential rising star in the Party until, after one too many controversial cases that embarrassed powerful elements in the Party, Chen Cao found himself neutralized. Under the guise of a major promotion, a new position with a substantial title but no power, he's stripped of his job duties and isolated. But that's still not enough, as it becomes increasingly clear that someone is attempting to set him up, for public disgrace and possibly worse. </p><p>Chen Cao is technically in charge of the corruption case of a "Red Prince"---a powerful, high Party figure who embodies the ruthless ambition, greed, and corruption that is increasingly evident in the new China. This "Red Prince" has the kind of connections and power to deflect any attempts to bring him to justice.

It answers everyday cooking quandaries - what to give the kids for tea, how to rustle up a meal for friends or an impromptu kitchen party in moments, or what to do about those black bananas, wrinkled apples and bullet-hard plums - and since real cooking is so often about leftovers, here one recipe can morph into another...from ham hocks to pea soup and pasties, from braised chicken to Chinatown salad. This isn&#39;t just about being thrifty but about being creative and seeing how recipes evolve. As well as offering the reader a mouthwatering array of inspired new recipes - from clams with chorizo to Guinness gingerbread, from Asian braised beef to flourless chocolate lime cake, from Pasta alla Genovese to Venetian carrot cake - Nigella rounds up her kitchen kit must-haves (and, crucially, what isn&#39;t needed) in the way of equipment and magical standby ingredients. But above all, she reminds the reader how much pleasure there is to be had in real food and in reclaiming the traditional rhythms of the kitchen, as she cooks to the beat of the heart of the home, creating simple, delicious recipes to make life less complicated. The expansive, lively narrative, with its rich feast of food, makes this new work a natural 21st-century successor to Nigella&#39;s classic How To Eat, this time with a wealth of photographs from the instructive to the glorious, and accompanied by a BBC TV series. 190 recipes, including over 60 express-style at 30 minutes or under.</p><p>Nigella Lawson is the author of bestselling books - How to Eat (&#39;may just be the best cookery book ever&#39; Daily Telegraph), How to be a Domestic Goddess (British Book Awards 2001), Nigella Bites (WHSmith Award 2002) Forever Summer (&#39;images of warmth and Mediterranean climes&#39; Time Out), Feast, (&#39;a voluptuous and delicious piece of food writing&#39; Guardian), Nigella Express (no. 1 bestseller with over 1 million sales), Nigella Christmas (&#39;everything to make your Christmas sparkle&#39; Independent) and Nigellissima - which, together with her successful TV series and her recent iPhone App, Nigella Quick Collection, have made hers a household name around the world. She lives in London with her family.<b>Spanish chicken with chorizo and potatoes</b><br><br>Much as I love to have a pan bubbling away on the stove, I often feel that the most stressfree way to feed people is by taking the oven route. When I'm frazzled, I firmly believe that the tray-bake is the safest way to go. Enjoy the easefulness of the oven: you just bung everything in, and you're done. I think I'd go to the supreme effort of laying on a green salad as well but, other than that, you may kick up your flamenco heels and enjoy the fiesta.<br><br><b>Serves 6</b><br>2 x 15ml tablespoons regular olive oil<br>12 chicken thighs (bone in, with skin)<br>750g chorizo sausages, whole if baby ones, or cut into 4cm chunks if regular-sized<br>1kg new potatoes, halved<br>2 red onions, peeled and roughly chopped<br>2 teaspoons dried oregano<br>grated zest 1 orange<br><br>Preheat the oven to 220�C/gas mark 7. Put the oil in the bottom of 2 shallow roasting tins, 1 tablespoon in each. Rub the skin of the chicken in the oil, then turn skin-side up, 6 pieces in each tin.<br><br>Divide the chorizo sausages and the new potatoes between the 2 tins. Sprinkle the onion and the oregano over, then grate the orange zest over the contents of the 2 tins.<br><br>Cook for 1 hour, but after 30 minutes, swap the top tray with the bottom tray in the oven and baste the contents with the orange-coloured juices.<br><br><i>Making leftovers right</i><br>chicken<br>tortillas<br><i>You can reheat what remains (removing the bones from the chicken first) within 2 days, maybe with some canned chopped tomatoes, sherry and orange juice, but my absolute favourite final destination for this dish is a quesadilla. When I was last in Kansas, that shining city of lights, I breakfasted on a chicken, pepperjack and potato quesadilla (as one does) and it inspired me. So, just get as many soft flour tortillas as your leftovers command, take the bones out of the chicken, dice the meat along with the chorizo and potatoes, and stir in some diced, shredded or grated cheese (Cheddar, mozzarella, Monterey Jack, all are possible), dollop some of the mixture into each tortilla, fold, then griddle or fry. Make sure the chicken is piping hot. This makes for a splendid hangover-banishing breakfast or near-instant supper, the sort you chow down on while watching something compellingly bad on TV.</i><br><b>Vietnamese pork noodle soup</b><br><br>I couldn't contemplate a section of speedy suppers without a noodle soup. Nothing can give succour as fast as a bowl of noodles in flavoursome broth. This is good for chowing down and for slurping and for keeping body and soul together when your stomach's empty and your day's been full.<br><br>In extremis, I am more than happy to use frozen chopped ginger and chilli, which are kept in my deep-freeze for just such an eventuality (not so infrequent).<br><br><b>Serves 2 - 4</b>, <i>depending how hungry you are</i><br><br>275g pork fillet, cut into thin discs and then fine strips<br>2 x 15ml tablespoons lime juice<br>2 x 15ml tablespoons soy sauce<br>� teaspoon paprika<br>2 x 15ml tablespoons fish sauce<br>250g ramen noodles<br>1 x 15ml tablespoon garlic oil<br>6 thin or 3 fat spring onions, finely sliced<br>1 x 15ml tablespoon chopped fresh (or frozen) ginger<br>1 litre chicken stock (good-quality cube or concentrate is fine), preferably organic<br>300g beansprouts<br>175g baby pak choi, torn into pieces<br>2 teaspoons chopped red chilli<br><br>Put the strips of pork fillet into a bowl and add the lime juice, soy sauce, paprika and fish sauce, but don't let this stand for more than 15 minutes.<br><br>Cook the noodles according to packet instructions and then refresh in cold water. Heat a wok or a deep, heavy-based frying pan, then add the garlic oil and fry the spring onions and ginger for a minute or so. Add the pork and its liquid to the wok, stirring as you go.<br><br>Cook the meat in the pan for another 2 minutes, then make up the chicken stock with boiling water, add the hot stock to the pan and bring to the boil.<br><br>Check the pork is cooked through, then add the beansprouts and baby pak choi. Add water if the soupy base has evaporated too much - about 125ml of freshly boiled water should do the trick, but you may not need it.<br><br>Arrange the drained noodles equally in 2 large or 4 small warmed bowls, ladle over them the pork and vegetables, and finally the soupy stock. Scatter the chopped chilli on top and serve.<br><b>Maple pecan bundt cake</b><br><br>This is the cake that emblematically scratches that Domestic Goddess itch: it's feelgood food (for cook and eater) by way of some simple stirring. The nutty syrupy filling is simply forked into being; you could make the cake batter with no more equipment than a bowl and a wooden spoon. But I'm afraid even my alter ego, the Domestic Goddess, is lazy, so I use an electric mixer. But beware the processor here: it's easy to overmix as you blitz, and while a dense sponge is good, a rubbery one - clearly - is not.<br><br>Not only do I love making this cake, but I get a rare feeling of calm contentment just seeing it on its stand on the kitchen surface. Then there's the eating of it, a greedy slice alongside a mid-afternoon mug of coffee, which produces nothing less than a surge of body-and-soul-bolstering joy. Now, this is what a weekend is for . . .<br><br><b>Cuts easily into 12 slices</b><br><br><i>for the maple pecan filling:</i><br>75g plain flour<br>30g soft unsalted butter<br>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>150g pecans (or walnuts), roughly chopped<br>125ml maple syrup<br><br><i>for the cake:</i><br>300g plain flour<br>1 teaspoon baking powder<br>1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda<br>125g soft unsalted butter<br>150g caster sugar<br>2 eggs<br>250ml cr�me fra�che or sour cream<br>1-2 teaspoons icing sugar, for decoration<br>flavourless oil, for greasing<br>1 x 23cm bundt tin<br><br>Preheat the oven to 180�C/gas mark 4. Using flavourless oil (or a squirt of cooking spray) grease your bundt tin, and leave upside down on newspaper for the excess oil to drain out.<br><br>Make the filling for the cake by mixing together the 75g flour and 30g butter with a fork, till you end up with the sort of mixture you'd expect when making crumble topping. Then, still using the fork, mix in the cinnamon, chopped pecans (or walnuts) and maple syrup, to form a sticky, bumpy paste. Set aside for a moment.<br><br>For the cake, measure the 300g flour, the baking powder and bicarb into a bowl.<br><br>Now, cream the butter and sugar (i.e. beat well together until light in texture and pale in colour), then beat in 1 tablespoon of the flour mixture, then 1 egg, then another tablespoonful of flour mixture followed by the second egg.<br><br>Add the rest of the flour mixture beating as you go, and then finally the cr�me fra�che or sour cream. You should expect to end up with a fairly firm cake batter.<br><br>Spoon just more than half the cake batter into the oiled bundt tin. Spread the mixture up the sides a little and around the funnel of the tin to create a rim. You don't want the sticky filling to leak out to the sides of the tin.<br><br>Dollop the maple filling carefully into the dent in the cake batter, then cover the filling with the remaining batter. Smooth the top and put the tin into the oven for 40 minutes, though it's best to check with a cake tester after 30 minutes.<br><br>Once cooked, and the cake tester comes out clean where it hits the sponge (obviously, any gooey filling will stick to the tester), let the cake cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes in its tin, then loosen the edges with a small spatula, including around the middle funnel bit, and turn the cake out onto the rack.<br><br>When the cake is cold, dust with icing sugar by pushing a teaspoonful or so through a tea strainer.<br><br><i>make ahead note</i><br>Can be baked up to 2 days ahead. Wrap tightly in clingfilm and store in airtight container. Dust with icing sugar just before serving.<br><br><i>freeze note</i><br>The cake can be frozen, tightly wrapped in double layer of clingfilm and a layer of foil, for up to 3 months. Defrost overnight at room temperature and dust with icing sugar just before serving.</p><h2>Ray</h2><p>A small-town southern physician, in his mid-thirties--who is also an adoring husband, a philanderer, a devoted but unnoticing father, a frustrated poet, and a frustrated killer--finds some fulfillment in caring for losers and lunatics.</p><p>Nominated for the American Book Award, Ray is the bizarre, hilarious, and consistently adventurous story of a life on the edge.

By <i>mysterious</i> coincidence, it seems, many Masons have been major figures in modern history. many of the Founding Fathers of the United States&#x2014;including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Paul Revere&#x2014;were Freemasons. Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Italian freedom fighter, was also one, as were the composers Franz Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and writers Fran�ois Marie Arouet de Voltaire and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. <i>The Meaning of Masonry</i> explores the beliefs behind the order, its cryptic rites and symbols, and uncovers its ultimate purpose.</p><p></p><h2>Nella Last in the 1950s: The Further Diaries of Housewife, 49</h2><p><i>'I can never understand how the scribbles of such an ordinary person ... can possibly have value.'</i> So wrote Nella Last in her diary on 2 September 1949. Sixty years on, tens of thousands of people have read and enjoyed the first two volumes of her uniquely detailed and moving diaries, written during World War II and its aftermath as part of the Mass Observation project, and the basis for BAFTA-winning drama Housewife 49 starring Victoria Wood (with a follow-up under discussion).<br><br>This third compelling volume sees Nella, now in her sixties, writing of what ordinary people felt during those years of growing prosperity in a modernising Britain. Her diary offers a detailed, moving and humorous narrative of daily life at a time that shaped the society we live in today. It is an account that's full of surprises as we learn more about her relationship with 'my husband' (never 'Will') and her fears of nuclear war. Outwardly Nella's life was commonplace; but behind this mask were a penetrating mind and a lively pen.

Drawn in part from Wilentz&#x2019;s essays as &#x201c;historian in residence&#x201d; of Dylan&#x2019;s official website, <i>Bob Dylan in America </i>is a unique blend of fact, interpretation, and affinity&#x2014;a book that, much like its subject, shifts gears and changes shape as the occasion warrants. <br><br> Beginning with his explosion onto the scene in 1961, this book follows Dylan as he continues to develop a body of musical and literary work unique in our cultural history. Wilentz&#x2019;s approach places Dylan&#x2019;s music in the context of its time, including the early influences of Popular Front ideology and Beat aesthetics, and offers a larger critical appreciation of Dylan as both a song�writer and performer down to the present. Wilentz has had unprecedented access to studio tapes, recording notes, rare photographs, and other materials, all of which allow him to tell Dylan&#x2019;s story and that of such masterpieces as <i>Blonde on Blonde </i>with an unprecedented authenticity and richness. <br><br> <i>Bob Dylan in America</i>&#x2014;groundbreaking, comprehensive, totally absorbing&#x2014;is the result of an author and a subject brilliantly met.</p><p><b>SEAN WILENTZ </b>is Sidney and Ruth Lapidus Professor in the American Revolutionary Era at Princeton University. He is the author of <i>The Rise of American Democracy</i>, which received the coveted Bancroft Prize, and, most recently, <i>The Age of Reagan</i>. He has also received a Deems Taylor Award for musical com�mentary and a Grammy nomination for his liner notes to <i>Bootleg Series, Vol. 6: Bob Dylan, Live 1964: The Concert at Philharmonic Hall</i>.<p>PART I: BEFORE<br>&nbsp;<br>1<br>&nbsp;<br>MUSIC FOR THE COMMON MAN:<br>&nbsp;<br>The Popular Front and Aaron Copland's America<br>&nbsp;<br>Early in October 2001, Bob Dylan began a two-month concert tour of the northern United States. In his first performances since the terrorist attacks of September 11, Dylan debuted many of the songs on his new album, "Love and Theft," including the prescient song of disaster, "High Water (for Charley Patton)." Columbia Records, eerily, had released "Love and Theft" on the same day that the terrorists struck. How, if at all, would Dylan now respond to the nation's trauma? Would he, for once, speak to the audience? What would he play?<br>&nbsp;<br>The new tour had no opening act, but as a concert prelude the audience heard (as had become commonplace at Dylan's shows) a prerecorded selection of orchestral music. And on this tour, Dylan began playing what may have seemed a curious choice: a recording of the "Hoe-Down" section of Aaron Copland's Rodeo. Then Dylan and his band took the stage and, with acoustic instruments, further acknowledged the awfulness of the moment, while also marking Dylan's changes and continuities over the years, by playing the country songwriter Fred Rose's "Wait for the Light to Shine":<br>&nbsp;<br>When the road is rocky and you got a heavy load<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait for the light to shine<br>&nbsp;<br>For the rest of the month, through fifteen shows, Dylan opened with "Wait for the Light to Shine," often after hitting the stage to "Hoe-Down." He would continue to play snatches of Rodeo at his concerts for several tours to come, and now and then he would throw in the opening blasts of Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man or bits of Appalachian Spring. Copland's music from the 1940s served as Dylan's call to order, his American invocation. Sixty years on, whether he knew it or not, Dylan had closed a mysterious circle, one that arced back through the folk-music revival where he got his start to the left-wing New York musical milieu of the Great Depression and World War II.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anyone familiar with Dylan's music knows about its connections to the 1930s and 1940s through the influences of Woody Guthrie and, to a lesser extent, Pete Seeger. But there are other connections as well, to a broader world of experimentation with American music and radical politics during the Depression years and after. These larger connections are at times quite startling, especially during the mid-1930s, when shared leftist politics brought together in New York a wide range of composers and musicians not usually associated with one another. Thereafter, many of the connections are elliptical and very difficult to pin down. They sometimes involve not direct influence but shared affinities and artistic similarities recognized only in retrospect. Yet they all speak to Dylan's career, and illuminate his artistic achievement, in ways that Guthrie's and Seeger's work alone do not. The most important of these connections leads back to Aaron Copland and his circle of politically radical composers in the mid-1930s.<br>&nbsp;<br>On March 16, 1934, Copland participated in a concert of his own compositions, sponsored by the Composers' Collective of the Communist Party-affiliated Workers Music League and held at the party's Pierre Degeyter Club on Nineteenth Street in New York. Copland was still known, at age thirty-three, a decade after first making his mark, as a young, iconoclastic, modernist composer. The collective, with which Copland was closely associated, had been founded in 1932 to nurture the development of proletarian music, and it consisted of about thirty members. The Degeyter Club took its name from the composer of the melody of "The Internationale."<br>&nbsp;<br>The review of the concert in the Communist newspaper Daily Worker praised Copland for his "progress from [the] ivory tower" and hailed his difficult Piano Variations, written in 1930, as a major, "undeniably revolutionary" work, even though Copland "was not 'conscious' of this at the time." A few months later, Copland, increasingly drawn to the leftist composers and musicians, won a songwriting contest, cosponsored by the collective and the pro-Communist periodical New Masses, for composing a quasi-modernist accompaniment to the militant poem "Into the Streets May First," written by the poet Alfred Hayes, who is best-known today for his lyrics to the song "Joe Hill." In the 1950s, Copland would publicly disown the piece as "the silliest thing I did." At the time, though, he was proud enough of what he called "my communist song" to bring it to the attention of his friend the Mexican composer Carlos Ch�vez, and to note that it had been republished in the Soviet Union. The Daily Worker's music reviewer later recalled that the contest judges agreed that Copland's song was "a splendid thing."<br>&nbsp;<br>That reviewer, who was one of the founders of the Composers' Collective and wrote under the pseudonym Carl Sands, was the Harvard-trained composer, professor, and eminent musicologist Charles Seeger. At this point, Seeger, a musical modernist, had little use for traditional folk music as a model for revolutionary culture. "Many folksongs are complacent, melancholy, defeatist," he wrote, "intended to make the slaves endure their lot-pretty, but not the stuff for a militant proletariat to feed on." A year later, though, the Communist Party, on instructions from the Comintern, abandoned its hyper-militant politics and avant-garde artistic leanings in favor of the broad political and cultural populism of the so-called Popular Front. The Composers' Collective duly folded in 1936, but Seeger took the shift in stride. In 1935, he moved his family to Washington, D.C., to work as an adviser to the Music Unit of the Special Skills Division of the Resettlement Administration, the forerunner of the New Deal's Farm Security Administration; and he and his second wife, the avant-garde composer Ruth Crawford Seeger, were able to collaborate with their friend John Lomax and his son Alan in helping to build the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress. In addition to collecting and transcribing traditional songs that were in danger of disappearing, the archive and its friends would encourage the development of folk music as a tool for radical politics-efforts that eventually helped inspire Bob Dylan and the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s.<br>&nbsp;<br>Charles's son Peter, then a teenager, had accompanied his father and stepmother to hear Copland discourse at the Degeyter Club, and during the summer of 1935 he traveled with his father to a square dance and music festival in Asheville, North Carolina, run by the legendary folklorist and mountain musician Bascom Lamar Lunsford. The youngster was already a crack ukulele player, but in Asheville he heard traditional folk music for the first time, played by Lunsford on a cross between a mandolin and a five-string banjo-and it changed his life forever.<br>&nbsp;<br>A few years later, after dropping out of Harvard and working under Alan Lomax at the Library of Congress, Pete Seeger teamed up with a revolving commune of folk artists, including a young songwriter discovered and recorded by Lomax, Woody Guthrie, to form the leftist Almanac Singers, who promoted union organizing, racial justice, and other causes with their topical songs. (The supervisor for one of the Almanacs' recording sessions in 1942, Earl Robinson, had written the tunes for "Joe Hill" and the Popular Front classic "Ballad for Americans"-and in 1935 he had studied piano with Copland at the Workers Music League's school.) In the late 1940s, the Almanac Singers evolved into the Weavers.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Weavers' recordings would later prove essential in introducing a younger generation, including Bob Dylan, to the music of Woody Guthrie and in sparking the broader folk-music revival. But the Weavers were not the only influential musical descendants of the Composers' Collective-and not the only ones drawn to American folk music.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like the Seegers, Aaron Copland continued his musical career with his politics intact. After winning his Communist song award in 1934, Copland spent the summer with his teenage lover, the photographer and aspiring violinist Victor Kraft, at a cabin his cousin owned in Lavinia, Minnesota, alongside Lake Bemidji and just to the west of the Mesabi Iron Range. Copland worked hard on his abstract and purposefully radical formal work, Statements for Orchestra, but also relaxed and took in what he called the "amusing town" of Bemidji, nearby. As he told a radical friend in New York, the amusements included some political escapades:<br>&nbsp;<br>It began when Victor spied a little wizened woman selling a Daily Worker on the street corners . . . From that, we learned to know the farmers who were Reds around these parts, attended an all-day election campaign meeting of the C.P. unit, partook of their picnic supper and [I] made my first political speech! . . . I was being drawn, you see, into the political struggle with the peasantry! I wish you could have seen them-the true Third Estate, the very material that makes revolution . . . When S. K. Davis, Communist candidate for Gov. in Minn. came to town and spoke in the public park, the farmers asked me to talk to the crowd. It's one thing to think revolution, or talk about it to one's friends, but to preach it from the streets-OUT LOUD-Well, I made my speech (Victor says it was a good one) and I'll probably never be the same!<br>&nbsp;<br>The "good one" for the Communist candidate in Bemidji was, as far as we know, the last political stump speech Copland ever delivered, and his slightly bemused, slightly awkward, and maybe self-ironic description-"the peasantry"? "the true Third Estate"? in northern Minnesota?-makes it sound out of character. But Copland and Kraft did seek out the "Reds around these parts" and joined in their political activity. "The summer of 1934," Copland's most thorough biographer writes, "found him no mere fellow traveler, but rather an active, vocal 'red.' " Thereafter, and until 1949, Copland, if not a member of the Communist Party, was aligned with the party, its campaigns, and its satellite organizations, connections he would later try to minimize and evade under hateful and intense political pressure-and under oath.<br>&nbsp;<br>Soon after he returned to New York, via Chicago, for the winter, Copland had his own reckoning with the Popular Front. But the first great musical sensation to come out of the Composers' Collective group and Copland's circle of friends after 1935 involved another young composer, Marc Blitzstein-who, many years later, would have a direct and profound impact on Bob Dylan, independent of the Popular Front folksingers. Born to an affluent Philadelphia family in 1905, Blitzstein had been a prodigy and made his professional debut at age twenty-one with the Philadelphia Orchestra, playing Liszt's E-flat piano concerto. Like Copland, Blitzstein had studied piano and composition in Paris in the 1920s with the formidable Nadia Boulanger, but after the onset of the Depression, living in New York, he found himself attracted to the radical theater more than to the concert hall. He felt a special kinship with the founders of the left-wing, socially conscious Group Theatre, including Harold Clurman (who had shared an apartment with Copland in Paris), Clifford Odets, and Elia Kazan.<br>&nbsp;<br>In 1932, Blitzstein wrote a one-act musical drama, The Condemned, based on the Sacco and Vanzetti case, a leftist cause c�l�bre, that was never produced. Through the mid-1930s, as a member of the Composers' Collective, he wrote film scores and workers' songs, including a submission to the songwriting contest that Copland won. All along, Blitzstein had begun turning to concepts of populist, modernist, left-wing musical theater, blending Marxist politics with jazz, Igor Stravinsky, cabaret, and folk songs. Bertolt Brecht and his musical collaborators Hanns Eisler and Kurt Weill had conceived and advanced these ideas in Germany before the Nazi takeover in 1933, and Eisler and Weill had brought them to New York as political �migr�s. Earlier, Blitzstein had condemned Weill's music as vulgar pandering, but now he had completely changed his mind. In the late summer of 1936, working at what he called a white heat, he completed a new proletarian musical play, The Cradle Will Rock.<br>&nbsp;<br>A hard-bitten allegory of capitalist greed and corruption, capped by an uprising of organized steelworkers, The Cradle Will Rock was the first important American adaptation of the Brecht-Eisler-Weill style-and it caused a firestorm. As the show took shape, Blitzstein's sponsor, the New Deal's government-funded Federal Theatre Project, already suffering reprisals from conservatives in Congress, became panicky. Practically on the eve of the first scheduled preview performance, the project, citing impending budget cuts, shut down the production and ordered the theater padlocked. Thinking fast, Blitzstein's collaborators-the young director Orson Welles and the producer John Houseman-vowed to defy the order, rented another theater, redirected ticket holders for the first preview to the new venue, and mounted an astounding sold-out debut. (The audience swelled into a standing-room-only crowd when the company invited passersby in for free.) The Actors' Equity union had forbidden the cast to perform the piece, just as the musicians' union had refused to allow its members to play in what had formally become a commercial production for less than union scale, and so, with Blitz-stein himself playing the score from a piano onstage, the actors spoke and sang their parts from the house. The hastily planned, seemingly spur-of-the-moment debut was a political as well as an artistic sensation. After a brief run, Cradle reopened some months later, by popular demand, under the auspices of Welles and Houseman's new Mercury Theatre company, and ran for an additional 108 performances.<br>&nbsp;<br>Aaron Copland was among those present for the impromptu premiere, and it thrilled him. ("The opening night of The Cradle made history," he wrote thirty years later, "none of us who were there will ever forget it.") Defending the show against charges that it was nothing but leftist propaganda, Copland allowed that "a certain sectarianism" limited its appeal, but he praised its innovative combination of "social drama, musical revue, and opera," and its clipped prosody and score.* Copland, meanwhile, had moved away from the dissonant modernism of his earlier work, and he would soon venture beyond orchestral music to write film scores and ballets. But Copland's own new direction had more in common with the all-American folk-song collecting of Charles Seeger and the Lomaxes that would later strongly affect Bob Dylan than it did with Blitzstein's Brechtian musical theater (which would also affect Dylan's work). Theirs were two very distinct artistic responses to the times, made by two ambitious, left-wing American Jewish composers and friends, one who was destined for international fame, the other for relative obscurity. Yet their sensibilities were closely related, at least in the mind of Aaron Copland.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copland's new, more o...</p></p><h2>The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mammals</h2><p>Tree peepers everywhere will enjoy these two guides which explore the incredible environment of our country's forests-including seasonal features, habitat, range, and lore.

Lewis, Severe Mercy, A: Includes 18 Letters By C.S. Lewis</p><p><i>A Severe Mercy</i>, by Sheldon Vanauken, is a heart-rending love story described by its author as "the spiritual autobiography of a love rather than of the lovers." Vanauken chronicles the birth of a powerful pagan love borne out of the relationship he shares with his wife, Davy, and describes the growth of their relationship and the dreams that they share. As a symbol of their love, they name their dream schooner the <i>Grey Goose</i>, "for the grey goose, if its mate is killed flies on alone and never takes another." <p> While studying at Oxford, Sheldon and Davy develop a friendship with C.S. Lewis, under whose influence and with much intellectual scrutiny they accept the Christian doctrine. As their devotion to God intensifies, Sheldon realizes that he is no longer Davy's primary love--God is. Within this discovery begins a brewing jealousy.</p><p> Shortly after, Davy acquires a fatal illness. After her death Sheldon embarks on an intense experience of grief, "to find the meaning of it, taste the whole of it ... to learn from sorrow whatever it had to teach." Through painstaking reveries, he comes to discover the meaning of "a mercy as severe as death, a severity as merciful as love." He learns that her death "had these results: It brought me as nothing else could do to know and end my jealously of God. It saved her faith from assault. ...And it saved our love from perishing."</p><p> Replete with 18 letters from C.S.

Beneath the veneer of modernisation however, it is another story. &#34;The Coming Collapse of China&#34; predicts the imminent implosion of the economy and government of the People&#39; s Republic of China. It is a fully revised and updated edition covering China&#39;s new membership of the WTO. The author is a Chinese American lawyer who has lived and worked in China and Hong Kong for over 20 years, bringing first-hand experience and economic expertise to this book.</p><p>From 1978 through the mid-1990s, China had the fastest-growing economy in the world, and it appeared poised to dominate Asia, and beyond, in the near future. But after focusing on facts rather than theory and looking at the conditions behind the spectacular numbers, Gordon Chang presents the People's Republic as a study in wasted potential: "Peer beneath the surface, and there is a weak China, one that is in long-term decline and even on the verge of collapse. The symptoms of decay are to be seen everywhere." For a nation that has always taken a long view of history, time is quickly running out. Chang believes China has about five years to get its economy in order before it suffers a crippling financial collapse--a timeline he seriously doubts can be met.<p> By failing to complete its reformation, China has maintained an illusion of progress, Chang explains, but in reality has caused more problems than opportunities for would-be entrepreneurs and foreign investors. Because reform has not been fast enough or comprehensive enough, China is unable to benefit from its modernization or keep up technologically with much of the world. The government's reluctance to get rid of state-owned enterprises has not only rendered China uncompetitive just as it prepares to join the World Trade Organization, but is causing the banks--which were forced to lend money to SOEs--to fail alongside them. Widespread unemployment, corruption within the Communist party, millions of resentful peasants, and a general lack of leadership further threaten stability. The Communist party "knows how to suppress but it no longer has the power to lead," Chang writes, arguing that the party is maintaining control only through the use of brute force and the people's instinct for obedience--popular support that could deteriorate as soon as the economy plunges. Simultaneously, societal ills such as gambling, drugs, and prostitution have become huge problems.</p><p> Stuck between Communism and capitalism, "China is drifting, unwilling to go forward as fast as it must and unable to turn back."

First, her birth father, who left her with only an inheritance of addiction and Native American blood, its meaning a mystery. As Febos tentatively reconnects, she sees how both these lineages manifest in her own life, marked by compulsion and an instinct for self-erasure. Meanwhile, she remains closely tied to the sea captain who raised her, his parenting ardent but intermittent as his work took him away for months at a time. Woven throughout is the hypnotic story of an all-consuming, long-distance love affair with a woman, marked equally by worship and withdrawal. In visceral, erotic prose, Febos captures their mutual abandonment to passion and obsession -- and the terror and exhilaration of losing herself in another. </p><p>At once a fearlessly vulnerable memoir and an incisive investigation of art, love, and identity, <i>Abandon Me </i>draws on childhood stories, religion, psychology, mythology, popular culture, and the intimacies of one writer&#x2019;s life to reveal intellectual and emotional truths that feel startlingly universal.</p></p><p><b>Melissa Febos</b>&nbsp;is the author of the memoir, <i>Whip Smart.</i>&nbsp;Her work has appeared in <i>The</i> <i>Kenyon Review</i>, <i>Prairie Schooner</i>, <i>Guernica, Glamour</i>, <i>Post Road</i>, <i>Salon, New York Times</i>, <i>Dissent, Bitch Magazine, </i>and elsewhere.<i> </i>Her essays have won prizes from <i>Prairie Schooner</i>, <i>Story Quarterly</i>, and The Center for Women Writers, and she is the recipient of fellowships from Bread Loaf,Virginia Center for Creative Arts, Vermont Studio Center, The Barbara Deming Memorial Fund, Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, and The MacDowell Colony.

(And fans of Rucka--assuming they get around to reading this at all--will still likely hold the opinion that Atticus Kodiak could take Batman in a standup fight any day.)<p> DC shook up Gotham--literally--in its 1999 Batman plot arc: a 7.6 earthquake rocked Gotham City, wreaking enough destruction to bring the broken, crime-ridden, runt kid-brother of Metropolis and New York to its knees. In the story line's most indulgent liberty, those fat cats in Washington decide to write off Gotham, � la <i>Escape from New York</i>, blowing up the connecting bridges, mining the surrounding waterways, and signing into law the Federal Declaration of No Man's Land, which makes it a crime to even set foot in the city. The usual suspects from Arkham Asylum, Two-Face and the Penguin, the Riddler and Dr. Freeze, Poison Ivy and Mr. Zsasz, file out to begin running the show, strong-arming and manipulating the block-by-block turf battles that envelop the now-ultraviolent city. A conflicted Batman shows up fashionably late, only to find that these lunatics are the least of his worries: Lex Luthor, Superman's archfoe, has nefarious designs on Gotham too. Could this possibly get any better? Sure, <i>No Man's Land</i> is derivative fiction, but the appeal of Rucka--and, of course, Batman--can make this one worth the read. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>The author of four novels about professional bodyguard Atticus Kodiak -- <i>Keeper</i> (nominated for a Shamus Award by the Private Eye Writers of America), <i>Finder, Smoker,</i> and <i>Shooting at Midnight,</i> <b>Greg Rucka</b> has been writing since he was eight years old, and hopefully is improving with age. A longtime comics fan, his first graphic novel series was the suspense thriller <i>Whiteout,</i> published by Oni Press and nominated for three Eisner Awards in 1999. Since that time he has been a contributing writer for DC Comics and an active participant in the Batman series of titles. Born and raised in California, he earned his undergraduate degree at Vassar College and his MFA at the University of Southern California. He currently resides in Portland, Oregon.

Beaton has written fourteen Hamish Macbeth mysteries. She is the author of the Agatha Raisin series and is a film commentator on BBC television. M. C. Beaton lives in a Cotswolds cottage with her husband.Graeme Malcolm gives a nuanced portrayal of diverse characters inhabiting or visiting a remote village in northern Scotland. Various characters stride across the canvas, and Malcolm essays them all, including a grumpy American, and Englishmen and women from down south. Malcolm succeeds without going into falsetto or mumbling incoherently; it's all in the pacing and accent and cadence. His vaguely Scottish narrative voice binds the story together. Constable Hamish Macbeth, who has starred in 20 previous mysteries, must cope with a delusional female visitor whose fantasies lead to murder. The voice and the setting are so compatible that one settles back and enjoys the story, scarcely noticing the narrator's expertise.

Bespeckled with blood, surrounded by enemies, and bound on a dark course whose ultimate destination I cannot fathom&#x2014;I am not brave. <br>The nub of a candle casts quaking light on my damp chamber. I have been afforded a quill and a logbook only after insisting that measurement and notation are crucial to the task before me. <br>I have no intention of cooperating for long; indeed, I hope to have a plan of escape soon. Meanwhile, I am taking refuge in these blank pages, to make note of my captors&#x2019; physiognomy and to list their atrocities that they might be brought properly to justice, but most of all to clear my head, for it is by God&#x2019;s mercy alone that I have not been driven mad by what I have seen and endured. <br>Sleep is impossible; the swells churn my stomach, and my heart scrambles to free itself from my throat. My anxiety provokes a terrible need to relieve myself, but my chamber pot threatens to spill with every lurch of this damned craft. I use a soiled towel for my ablutions, the very towel that was on my person when I was cruelly kidnapped just days ago. <br>To see my employer, as true and honest a gentleman as England ever sired, so brutally murdered, without the opportunity to defend himself, by the very criminals he had striven so ardently to rid the world of, was a shock I can hardly bear. Even now my hand, which can lift a cauldron with ease, trembles at the memory. <br>But I must record while my recollections are fresh, for I cannot be sure that any of the other witnesses were spared. My own survival is due not to mercy but to the twisted whimsy of the beast they call Captain Mabbot. <br>It transpired thus. <br>I had accompanied Lord Ramsey, God rest his soul, to Eastbourne, the quaint seaside summer home of his friend and colleague Mr. Percy. There we rendezvoused with Lord Maraday, Mr. Kindell, and their wives. It was not a trivial trip, as the four men represented the most influential interests in the Pendleton Trading Company. <br>I had been in his lordship&#x2019;s employ for eight years, and it was his habit to bring me along on journeys, saying, as he did, &#x201c;Why should I suffer the indignities of baser victuals in my autumn years when I have you?&#x201d; Indeed, it had been my honor to meet and cook for gentlemen and ladies of the highest stature, and to have seen the finest estates of the countryside. My reputation grew in his service, and I have been toasted by generals and duchesses throughout England. Happily for me, his lordship rarely went overseas, and even on those occasions he left me in London, respecting my considerable aversion to the rolling of ships. <br>This particular trip had me at my most vigilant, not only due to the prominence of the guests but because the Percy seat was reportedly rustic, of unknown appointment, and sporting a historic oven without proper bellows or ventilation. Try as I did, I could not acquire reliable information as to the status of the pantry prior to arrival. For this reason I provisioned myself with a menagerie of ducks, quail, and a small but vociferous lamb, as well as boxed herbs and spices, columns of cheeses, and my best whisks and knives. Lord Ramsey teased that I had packed the entire kitchen. But I could see in his face satisfaction at my diligence. His faith in me was a poultice for my nerves. As usual, I had worried myself sleepless over the event. The modest size of the house prevented me from bringing my able assistants&#x2014;a stroke of luck for them, as they are safe now in London. Rather, I relied wholly on the staff brought by the other guests. <br>Eastbourne was as lovely as I had heard, with foals cavorting in the pasture and the woods promising moss-cushioned idylls. The house itself commanded stunning views of the channel, an azure scarf embroidered with sails and triumphal clouds. As it happened, both pantry and scullery maids were more than adequate. While I always prefer my kitchen at his lordship&#x2019;s seat in London&#x2014;every inch of which I have organized, from the height of the pastry table to the library of spices catalogued both by frequency of use and alphabetically&#x2014;I nevertheless took pleasure in anointing a new kitchen with aromas. <br>With great energy I oversaw the unpacking of my provisions and set a scullery maid to heating the oven in preparation for a four-course meal. Despite my anxiety, I was looking forward to this short week away from the noise and bustle of London and had planned to take an early-morning stroll the following day to savor the wildflowers and sylvan air. <br>What ignorance. Even as Ramsey lifted his glass for a toast, unwelcome guests were moving through the garden. <br>Basil-beef broth had been served, with its rainbow sheen of delicate oils trembling on the surface and a flavor that turned the tongue into the very sunlit hill where the bulls snorted and swung their heavy heads. The broth was met with appreciation (the kitchen was close enough to the dining room, just a door away, that I could hear every chuckle and whisper of praise). I had just arranged the duck. The brick oven had surpassed my expectations; the cherry glaze flowed like molten bronze over the fowl and pooled in crucibles of grilled pear. The servants were carrying the platter to the table when a frightful noise at the front vestibule brought all levity to a halt. <br>I opened the kitchen door just far enough to poke my head into the dining area. The other staff crowded around me to see. We made a comical sight, no doubt, so many heads peering through one door like the finale of a puppet show. <br>From there we could see what was left of the entrance. A petard had left a smoking hole where the lock had been. A second later the door was kicked in by a mountain of a man I would come to know as Mr. Apples. <br>My shock at the sight of this breach cannot be expressed, and so I will content myself with descriptions of a visual nature. <br>Mr. Apples might have been drawn by a particularly violent child. His torso is massive, but his head is tiny and covered by a woolen hat with earflaps. His shoulders are easily four feet in span. His arms are those of a great ape&#x2019;s and end in hands large enough to hide a skillet. <br>He surveyed the room and, seeing no immediate resistance, stood aside to allow the others in. He was followed by not one but two short Chinamen in black silk, twins in face and dress; they entered with their hands clasped behind their backs, swords swinging from their hips. One of them wore his queue wrapped around his neck like a scarf. They took their positions flanking the hall. <br>The three made a curious group, the hulk of Mr. Apples and these two child-sized Orientals. If not for the mutilation of the door, I would have thought we were about to enjoy a mummer&#x2019;s theater. <br>Then entered a pillar of menace, a woman in an olive long-coat. Her red hair hung loose over her shoulders. She sauntered to the middle of the room, her coat opening to reveal jade-handled pistols. Using a chair as a stepping stool, she walked upon the dining table to Lord Ramsey&#x2019;s plate and stood there looking down, as if she had just conquered Kilimanjaro. Her boots added inches to her already long frame. No one dared tell her, apparently, that tall women confuse the eye. <br>Even I, who know only what I read in the dailies, recognized her at once. There, not twenty feet from me, was the Shark of the Indian Ocean, Mad Hannah Mabbot, Back-from-the-Dead Red, who had been seen by a dozen credible witnesses to perish by gunshot and drowning, and yet had continued to haunt the Pendleton Trading Company routes, leaving the waters bloody in her wake. <br>Lord Ramsey leaped from his chair and fled toward the back steps (never had I seen him move with such urgency), but he was intercepted by one of the twins, who must have given him a blow, for he crumpled to the floor gasping. Mr. Percy, finally realizing his obligation to protect his guests, made a valiant attempt to retrieve an heirloom sword from the mantel, but the massive Mr. Apples brought down his fist and ruined Mr. Percy&#x2019;s face as a child ruins a pie. <br>A terrible silence filled the house, interrupted only by the wet whimpering of Mr. Percy and the equine clopping of Mad Mabbot&#x2019;s boots as she descended and approached Lord Ramsey&#x2019;s supine figure. There, with pleasure plain on her face, Mabbot drew her pistols and leveled both barrels. <br>Posterity will reprimand me for not making an attempt to protect him, and well it should. Despite my girth, I am a sorry pugilist. As a child, I was bullied by children much smaller than myself. Mr. Percy, whose fate I had just witnessed, had fought against Napoleon&#x2019;s cavalry. I had no hope of faring any better. I should like to have a better excuse, but I was simply frozen under my white toque. <br>Mabbot was only paces from me, and I could hear as she spoke to Lord Ramsey in the cheery tone a milkmaid may use to soothe a cow. <br>&#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t get up&#x2014;we can&#x2019;t stay long. Once I learned you were in the neighborhood, I simply couldn&#x2019;t miss the opportunity to drop in and see you in person. Did you know your clever corsair is using red-hot cannonballs now? Those were a treat! You can imagine the excitement.&#x201d; <br>Ramsey cleared his throat twice before speaking, and still his voice quavered as he said, &#x201c;Mabbot&nbsp;&#x2026; Hannah, let me propose that we&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But the world is glutted with your proposals,&#x201d; Mabbot interrupted. &#x201c;Mr. Apples, would you like to hear a proposal from Ramsey?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Rather eat my trousers,&#x201d; the giant said from across the room. <br>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t aged well,&#x201d; Mabbot said, lifting Ramsey&#x2019;s chin with the tip of her boot. &#x201c;Are you really so surprised? Did you think I&#x2019;d be content to be hunted the rest of my days and not find a way to return the favor?&#x201d; Leaning close, she murmured, &#x201c;But between you and me, it&#x2019;s going after the Brass Fox that really irks me. I can&#x2019;t let you win that race, can I? <br>At this point Lord Ramsey said something more. I didn&#x2019;t hear it. Most likely he was taking the opportunity to mumble a prayer. <br>Mabbot bit her lip, frowned, and said, &#x201c;Tell the devil to keep my tea hot. I&#x2019;m running late.&#x201d; Then she fired point-blank, without mercy or provocation, into his defenseless body. <br>One of her guns did not go off, apparently, for as Ramsey writhed, she examined the trigger with irritation. She knocked the faulty flintlock with the butt of the other gun, aimed it again, and discharged it directly into his poor heart. He lay still at last. <br>Even as I write this, my body starts at the memory of that merciless retort, the smoke and spatter. <br>Satisfied, the red-haired rogue sat in Ramsey&#x2019;s seat at the table and forked a glistening cherry into her mouth while her thugs threw the other guests to the floor. <br>The desire to live moved me, and, remembering the small door beside the pantry I had seen the servants use, I made for my escape. I tumbled down dark steps into a subterranean brick tunnel, through which I groped as quickly as I could, sure it would lead to the staffs&#x2019; quarters behind the house. When the tunnel branched, I veered left and came upon another set of steps and a door. I burst through, prepared to run, but I had misjudged the direction, for I found myself in the library with Mr. Apples&#x2019;s hand on my shoulder. He tossed me like a sack of laundry back into the dining room, where I was obliged to sit on the floor with the others. I took my position next to his lordship&#x2019;s body and held his still-warm hand while the fiends ransacked the house. <br>I confess that my mind was not prepared for these events. It failed under the pressure and became that of an idiot, lingering on the lace of the tablecloth and bringing to light the oldest and most obscure memories quite randomly: being taught to swim in the freezing lake behind the orphanage with the other boys by Father Keenly, who bade us fetch coins he threw into the water; kneading my first loaf of bread and wondering at the magic of its rising. Father Sonora&#x2019;s voice, so long ago I was sure I had lost it, now came back, as vividly as if he were just behind me, saying, &#x201c;Hush, child, God despises whimpering.&#x201d; <br>Fear, for the moment, left me and was replaced with a readiness to meet my wife, Elizabeth, in heaven. I saw her then as I had last seen her, holding the newborn child curled upon her breast, both of them serene in the coffin. Then my sight fixed on Lord Ramsey&#x2019;s torn chest, where grew, slowly, a scarlet bubble. I cannot say whether it was two minutes or two hours I stared at that gory dome before I came to my senses. <br>The staff had gathered before the mantel, and the rest of the party remained on the floor near the table in various states of distress. One maid wept where she sat and inched her way across the floor to avoid the puddle of blood spreading toward her. This was the young woman I had just yelled at an hour earlier for washing a copper-bottomed pot with strong vinegar. She had held her composure then, but now&#x2014;who could blame her&#x2014;the tears darkened her smock. When she discovered blood upon her apron and began to scream, I crawled to her, worried she might bring the pirates&#x2019; wrath upon us. I blotted the stain with my towel, saying, &#x201c;There, see? It is only a splash of wine. They&#x2019;ll be gone soon. Just hold on.&#x201d; I put my arm around her and hushed her, but I was too late; Mr. Apples was headed our way. <br>As he reached down, I beat at him with the towel. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch her,&#x201d; I wheezed. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s done nothing to you!&#x201d; <br>But the giant was after me, not the maid. He yanked me rudely to my feet and held me by the arms while Hannah Mabbot examined me. <br>&#x201c;Is this spirited man the cook?&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;Are you responsible for this delightful feast? What a piece of luck!&#x2026; What is it you say, Mr. Apples?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Like shittin&#x2019; with the pope.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, the other thing, less vulgar.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Whistlin&#x2019; donkey.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Quite! A surprise and a delight like a whistling&nbsp;&#x2026; How is it that these phrases make sense when you say them? Anyway, bring him along.&#x201d; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Eli Brown <br></p><h2>The Map as Art: Contemporary Artists Explore Cartography</h2><p>As seen in <em>O: The Oprah Magazine</em>, the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, <em>USA Today</em>, Cool Hunting, and countless other media outlets, <em>The Map as Art</em> is available now in a paperback edition.

Since the early 1950&#39;s, a secret police force known only as the Hand has been covertly protecting society and making sure that life continues along its prescribed path...</p><p>Grant Morrison has been working with DC Comics for more than twenty years, beginning with his legendary runs on the revolutionary titles ANIMAL MAN and DOOM PATROL. Since then he has written numerous best-sellers &#x2014; including JLA, BATMAN and <i>New X-Men</i> &#x2014; as well as the critically acclaimed creator-owned series THE INVISIBLES, SEAGUY, THE FILTH, WE3 and JOE THE BARBARIAN. Morrison has also expanded the borders of the DC Universe in the award-winning pages of SEVEN SOLDIERS, ALL-STAR SUPERMAN, FINAL CRISIS and BATMAN, INC., and he is currently reinventing the Man of Steel in the all-new ACTION COMICS.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his secret identity, Morrison is a &#x201c;counterculture&#x201d; spokesperson, a musician, an award-winning playwright and a chaos magician. He is also the author of the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller <i>Supergods</i>, a groundbreaking psycho-historic mapping of the superhero as a cultural organism. He divides his time between his homes in Los Angeles and Scotland.The mutant child of Alan Moore, Terence McKenna and Robert Anton Wilson, Morrison has emerged as one of only a handful of comics writers with a true voice and vision. He's as fascinated by paranoid conspiracy theories and the Kabbalah as he is by superhero archetypes. They're all played out in this psychedelic science fiction adventure. Like his best-known works <i>The Invisibles </i>and <i>Doom Patrol</i>, this story follows a subterranean organization with terrifying science at its disposal&#x2014;but in a break from Morrison's previous works, covert government agency the Hand is actually working to maintain the status quo against the mass hallucinations of a society that needs to dream. The story follows Greg Feely, a balding, middle-aged man who wants nothing more than to look at porn and care for his sick cat. It soon emerges that Feely is actually Ned Slade, special negotiator for the Hand. As Feely/Slade tries to decide which personality he really is, he takes on such twisted entities as deviant superman Spartacus Hughes; Anders Klimakks, a porn star with black semen and irresistible pheromones; the <i>Libertania</i>, a giant ocean liner that's its own country; and Dmitri, a deadly communist monkey assassin. Artistic collaborators Weston and Erskine capture this insanity with razor-sharp precision, dead-on characterizations and such memorable vistas as a decaying miniature world and planets covered with machines. <i>The Filth </i>isn't always entirely coherent, but for sheer audacity and density of ideas, it will stand up to many readings. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jesus didn't see a sick woman, he saw a daughter of God. He didn't see an outcast from society, he saw a child of Israel. He didn't see a sinner, he saw a person in the image of the Creator. Are we able to see others with the eyes of Jesus? Seeing rightly is the beginning of renewal, forgiveness, healing and grace. Seeing rightly, says Mark Labberton, is the beginning of how our hearts are changed. Through careful self-examination in the Spirit, we begin to bear the fruit of love toward others that can make a difference. Here is a chance to reflect on why our ordinary hearts can be complacent about the evils in the world and how we can begin to see the world like Jesus. With each chapter broken into brief segments punctuated by questions, this book is ideal for both personal reflection and group discussion. See what happens when you take a chance on the dangerous act of loving your neighbor. Your vision might just be changed forever.</p><p>Mark Labberton is president of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. He previously served as Lloyd John Ogilvie chair for preaching and director of the Lloyd John Ogilvie Institute for Preaching. Labberton came to Fuller after sixteen years as senior pastor of First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley, California. He has served as chair of John Stott Ministries (now Langham Partnership) and co-chair of the John Stott Ministries Global Initiative Fund. Today he continues to contribute to the mission of the global church as a senior fellow of International Justice Mission. He is the author of <em>The Dangerous Act of Loving Your Neighbor</em> and <em>The Dangerous Act of Worship</em>."This book is a refreshingly honest, very important resource for all followers of Christ. More and more people in the church today are reawakening to the importance of not just sharing, but also showing their faith. Mark Labberton gets back to basics in this book, reminding us all just why this shift is important. What is our motivation? Why must we serve? Labberton's authenticity, combined with practical ideas and steps for personal reflection, will deeply challenge and encourage all seeking to be faithful disciples of Christ." (Outreach, March/April 2012)<br><br>"Labberton has brought all this experience to bear in writing a book that should be read and studied by everyone who is serious about seeing the world as God sees it and becoming a person who lives the transforming power of God's justice in the world." (Neil Craigan, The Presbyterian Outlook, March 7, 2011)<br><br>"[<em>The Dangerous Act of Loving Your Neighbor</em>] can help a congregation experience profound insight into both God's character and our practical response to God's mission in the world." (Amy L. Sherman, Christian Century, February 2011)<br><br>"<em>The Dangerous Act of Loving Your Neighbor</em> is a thoughtful read for Christian readers, very highly recommended." (James A. Cox, Library Bookwatch, January 2011)<br><br>"This is a well-researched volume filled with hpe and encouragement for Christians who want to seek justice and help fulfill God's purpose of establishing a kingdom free of abuse of power toward His people. Readers who want a fresh understanding of this call will treasure the ground Labberton treads." (JCH, Church Libraries, Winter 2010-11)<br><br>"Extremely well written, this book is meant to be read slowly. Labberton's writing is thoughtful, provocative, and penetrating. He provokes self-reflection, which is neither easy nor flattering. Be prepared to have your paradigm shifted and your distracted heart refocused. Recommend to pastors and group leaders." (David Mundt, CBA Retailers + Resources, December 2010)<br><br>"Labberton's most recent 'dangerous' installment challenges readers to reflect on why the heart can become complacent about the world and its needs. Labberton encourages readers to first see rightly, the beginning of how our hearts are changed." (Christian Retailing, December 2010)<br><br>"Operating as a workbook for personal growth, this may very well help promote change for a better world." (Susan DeGrane, Booklist, November 15, 2010)<br><br>"Beckmann, president of the Christian non-profit Bread for the World, lays out his case not just for the priority of dealing with hunger, but also for the need to deal with it with political solutions, not just through charity. Labberton argues persuasively that engaging injustice in the world must go hand in hand with a renewal of our hearts." (Mark Galli, Christianity Today, October 2010)<br><br>"<em>The Dangerous Act of Loving Your Neighbor</em> asks important questions, deeper questions we may not have thought to ask yet in our pursuit of justice, and ones that will take a lifetime to answer. We say we want justice, but our self-centric hearts betray us. So how do we override our hearts? This book opened my eyes to the difference between doing something and becoming <em>someone</em>--a person of justice, reoriented to the heart of Jesus."

Three generations of women in my family had devoted their lives to bringing babies into the world; the work was in my blood. But my path wasn&#x2019;t as obvious as that. I wasn&#x2019;t my mother&#x2014;a basket-weaving hippie who rejoiced in the magic of new, precious life. I wasn&#x2019;t my grandmother&#x2014;wise, no-nonsense, with a strong belief in the power of natural birth. I didn&#x2019;t even particularly like babies. No, for me, the decision to become a midwife had nothing to do with babies. And everything to do with mothers.<br>On the queen-sized bed, Eleanor&#x2019;s body curved itself into a perfect C. I crept up farther between her legs and pressed my palm against her baby&#x2019;s head. Labor had been fast and furious and I wasn&#x2019;t taking any chances. Eleanor&#x2019;s babies liked to catch us off guard. I&#x2019;d almost dropped her first son, Arthur, when he decided to make a sudden entrance as<br>Eleanor rocked over a birthing ball. She barely had time to gasp before he began to crown and we all had to rush into position. Her second son, Felix, was born in the birthing pool, five minutes after I&#x2019;d sent Susan, my birth assistant, on break. This time, I was going to be ready.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re nearly there.&#x201d; I pushed a sweaty strand of hair off Eleanor&#x2019;s temple. &#x201c;Your baby will be born with the next contraction.&#x201d;<br>Eleanor squeezed her husband&#x2019;s hand. As usual, Frank had been silent, reverent even. Dads varied enormously on their level of involvement. Some adopted the poses of their wives and girlfriends, panting and pushing along with them; others became so fixated on what ever<br>small task they had been assigned&#x2014;be it working the iPod or keeping the cup of ice chips full&#x2014;they nearly missed the birth entirely. I had a soft spot for the reverent ones. They knew they were in the presence of something special.<br>The baby&#x2019;s head turned to the right and Eleanor began to moan. The room fired with energy. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You ready?&#x201d;<br>Eleanor dropped her chin to her chest. Susan stood at my side as I eased the shoulders out&#x2014;first one, then the other&#x2014;until only the baby&#x2019;s legs remained inside. &#x201c;Would you like to reach down and pull your baby out, Eleanor?&#x201d;<br>Eleanor&#x2019;s sons had come too quickly to do this, but I was glad she&#x2019;d get the chance now. Of all the ways a baby could be delivered, this was my favorite. It seemed only right that after all the work a mother did during labor, her hands should bring her baby into the world.<br>A ghost of a smile appeared on Eleanor&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Really,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re ready when you are.&#x201d;<br>I nodded at Susan, who stood ready to catch the baby if it fell. But it wouldn&#x2019;t. In the ten years I&#x2019;d been delivering babies, I&#x2019;d never seen a child slip from its mother&#x2019;s grip. I watched as Eleanor pulled the black- haired baby from her body and lay it against her heart&#x2014; pink, slippery, and perfect. The cry was good and strong. Music to a midwife&#x2019;s ears.<br>&#x201c;Ah, how about that?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a girl.&#x201d;<br>Eleanor cried and laughed at once. &#x201c;A girl. It&#x2019;s a girl, Frank.&#x201d;<br>She was a good size. Ten fingers. Ten toes. Eleanor cradled her baby, still attached via cord, with the perfect balance of tenderness and protection. Frank stood beside them, awe lining his features. I&#x2019;d seen that look before, but it never got old. His wife had just become more amazing. More miraculous.<br>Susan beckoned Frank for cord cutting and began giving instructions. Seeing Frank&#x2019;s expression, I couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh. Susan had lived in Rhode Island since her nineteenth birthday, but forty years later, her thick Scottish accent meant she was largely incomprehensible to the American ear. On the upside, this made her the ideal person to share confidences with; even if she did disclose your secret, no one would understand. On the downside, I spent a lot of time translating.<br>&#x201c;Just cut between the clamps,&#x201d; I theater-whispered. Susan turned away, but her gray, tight-bound curls bounced on her head, so I was fairly sure she was chuckling.<br>Once the placenta had been delivered and the baby had breast-fed, I tended to Eleanor, settled the baby, and debriefed with the night nurse. When everything was done, I stood at the door. The room was calm and peaceful. The baby was on Eleanor&#x2019;s bare chest getting some skin-on-skin time. Frank was beside them, already asleep. I smiled. The scene before me was the reason I&#x2019;d become a midwife and, in my opinion, the real magic of childbirth. No matter how arduous the labor, no matter<br>how complete the mother&#x2019;s exhaustion, the men always fell asleep first.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you all tomorrow,&#x201d; I said, even though I wanted to stay.<br>Eleanor waved at me, and Frank continued to snore. I peeled off my gloves and was barely into the corridor when fingers clamped around my elbow and I started to fall. I thrust out a hand to catch myself, but instead of hitting the ground, I remained suspended in midair.<br>&#x201c;Hello, gorgeous.&#x201d;<br>Across the hall two young midwives giggled. I blinked up at Patrick, who held me in a theatrical dip. &#x201c;Very cute. Let me up.&#x201d;<br>Patrick, our consulting pediatrician from St. Mary&#x2019;s Hospital upstairs, was forever coming down to our birthing center, getting the nurses all excited with his ridiculous gestures. But I didn&#x2019;t bother being flattered. Yes, he was young and charming&#x2014;and good- looking in a disheveled, just- rolled- out- of- bed kind of way&#x2014;but I knew for a fact<br>that he dropped the word &#x201c;gorgeous&#x201d; with more regularity than I used the word &#x201c;contraction.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Your wish, my command.&#x201d; In a heartbeat I was back on two feet.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad I ran into you, actually,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I have a joke.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How many midwives does it take to screw in a lightbulb?&#x201d; Patrick didn&#x2019;t wait for an answer. &#x201c;Six. One to screw in the lightbulb and five<br>to stop the ob-gyn from interfering.&#x201d; He grinned. &#x201c;Good one, right?&#x201d;<br>I couldn&#x2019;t help a smile. &#x201c;Not bad.&#x201d;<br>I started walking and he fell into step beside me. &#x201c;Oh . . . Sean and I are heading to The Hip for a drink to night,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You in?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Hot date.&#x201d;<br>Patrick stopped walking and stared at me. That&#x2019;s how unlikely it was that I would have a date.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m kidding, obviously. I&#x2019;m going to Conanicut Island to have dinner with Gran and Grace.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; His face returned to normal. &#x201c;I take it you&#x2019;re not getting along any better with your mom, then?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why do you &#x2018;take&#x2019; that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You still call her Grace.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It is her name,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;I&#x2019;d started calling her Grace when I was fourteen&#x2014;the day I delivered my first baby. It had seemed strange, unprofessional, to call her Mom. Saying Grace felt so natural, I&#x2019;d stuck with it.<br>&#x201c;You sure you can&#x2019;t come for one drink? You haven&#x2019;t come for a drink for months.&#x201d; He adopted a pouty expression. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re too boring for you, aren&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br>I pushed through the door to the break room. &#x201c;Something like that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Next time, then?&#x201d; he called after me. &#x201c;Promise?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Promise,&#x201d; I called back. &#x201c;As long as you promise to learn some better jokes.&#x201d;<br>I was confident it was a promise he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to keep.</p> <p><br>I arrived in Conanicut Island at ten to eight. Gran&#x2019;s house, a shingle-style beach cottage, was perched on a grassy hill that rolled down to a rocky beach. She lived on the southern tip of the island, accessible only by one road across a thin strip of land from Jamestown. When I<br>was little, my parents and I used to rent a shack like Gran&#x2019;s every summer, and spend a few weeks in bare feet&#x2014;swimming at Mackerel Cove, flying kites, hiking in Beavertail State Park. Gran was the first to go on &#x201c;permanent vacation&#x201d; there. Grace and Dad followed a few years ago and now lived within walking distance. Grace had made a big deal about &#x201c;leaving me&#x201d; in Providence, but I was fine with it. Apart from the obvious fact that it meant Grace would be a little farther away from me and my business, I also quite liked the idea of having an excuse to visit Conanicut Island. Something happened to me when I drove over the Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge. I became a little floppier. A little more relaxed.<br>I stepped out of the car and scurried up the grassy path. I let myself in through the back door and was immediately hit by the scent of lemon and garlic.<br>Grace and Gran sat at the table in the wood- paneled dining room, heads bobbing with polite conversation. They didn&#x2019;t even look up when I entered, which showed how deaf they were both getting. I wasn&#x2019;t exactly light on my feet lately.<br>&#x201c;I made it.&#x201d;<br>They swiveled, then beamed in unison. Grace, in particular, lit up. Or maybe it was her orange lipstick and psychedelic dress that gave the effect. Something green&#x2014;a bean, maybe?&#x2014;was lodged between her front teeth, and the wind had done a number on her hair. Her bangs hung low over her eyes, reminding me of a fluffy red sheepdog.<br>&#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;Babies don&#x2019;t care if you have dinner plans, Neva,&#x201d; Gran said. A smile still pressed into her unvarnished face. &#x201c;No one knows that better than us.&#x201d;<br>I kissed them both, then dropped into the end chair. Half a chicken remained, as well as a few potatoes and carrots and a dish of green beans. A pitcher of ice water sat in the center with a little mint floating in it, probably from Gran&#x2019;s garden. Gran reached for the serving spoons and began loading up my plate. &#x201c;Lil hiding?&#x201d;<br>Lil, Gran&#x2019;s painfully shy partner of nearly eight years, was always curiously absent for our monthly dinners. When Gran had announced their relationship and, as such, her orientation, Grace was thrilled. She&#x2019;d yearned her whole life for a family scandal to prove how perfectly tolerant she was. Still, I had a bad feeling her avid displays of broadmindedness (one time she referred to Gran and Lil as her &#x201c;two mommies&#x201d;) were the reason Lil made herself scarce when we were around.<br>Gran sighed. &#x201c;You know Lil.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mom&#x2019;s not the only one who can bring a partner along, Neva,&#x201d; Grace said. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d like to bring a guy alo&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good idea.&#x201d; I stabbed some chicken with my fork. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring Dad next time.&#x201d;<br>Grace scowled, but one of my favorite things about her was that her attention span was short. &#x201c;Anyway, birthday girl. How does it feel? The last year of your twenties?&#x201d;<br>I speared a potato. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; How did I feel? &#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;m&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you how I feel,&#x201d; Grace said. &#x201c;Old. Feels like yesterday I was in labor with you.&#x201d; Grace&#x2019;s voice was soft, wistful. &#x201c;Remember looking down at her for the first time, Mom? All that red hair and porcelain<br>skin. We thought you&#x2019;d be an actress or a model for sure.&#x201d;<br>I swallowed my mouthful with a little difficulty. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not happy<br>I followed you into midwifery, Grace?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Happy? Why, I&#x2019;m only the proudest mom in world! Of course, I still wish you&#x2019;d come and work with me, doing home births. No doctors hovering about with their forceps, no sick people ready to cough all over the precious new babies&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There are no doctors or sick people at the birthing center, Grace.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Delivering in the comfort of one&#x2019;s own home, it&#x2019;s just . . .&#x201d;<br>Magical.<br>&#x201c;Magical,&#x201d; she said, with a smile. &#x201c;Oh! I nearly forgot.&#x201d; She reached for her purse and plucked out a flat, hand- wrapped gift. &#x201c;This is from your father and me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wow . . . You shouldn&#x2019;t have.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nonsense. It&#x2019;s your birthday.&#x201d;<br>Gran and I exchanged a look. Of course Grace had ignored the no-gifts directive&#x2014;the one thing I&#x2019;d wanted for my birthday. I hated gifts: the embarrassment of receiving them, the awkwardness of opening them in public, and, if it was from Grace, the pressure of ensuring my face was adequately arranged to demonstrate sheer delight, a wonder that I&#x2019;d ever been able to get through life before this particular ornament or treasure.<br>&#x201c;Go on.&#x201d; She pressed her hands together and wriggled her fingers. &#x201c;Open it.&#x201d;<br>An image of my thirteenth birthday flashed into my mind&#x2014;the first time since elementary school that I had agreed to a party. Maybe the fact that I was in the middle of my second-ever period and was cramping, bleeding, and wearing a surfboard- sized maxi pad in my underwear skewed my judgment. Grace wasn&#x2019;t happy when I insisted we keep it small (just four girls from school) and she was positively brokenhearted when I refused party games of any sort, but she didn&#x2019;t push her luck. With hindsight, that should have been my first clue. My friends and I had just gotten settled in the front room when Grace burst in.<br>&#x201c;Can I have your attention, please?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;As you know, today is Neva&#x2019;s thirteenth birthday. We are celebrating her becoming a teenager.&#x201d;<br>She looked like a children&#x2019;s stage performer, smiling so brightly that I thought her face might crack into three clean pieces. I willed her to vanish in a cloud of smoke, taking with her the previous thirty seconds and the crimson crushed- velvet dress she had changed into. But any notion that this might happen faded along with my friends&#x2019; smiles.<br>&#x201c;My baby is no longer a baby. Her body is changing and growing. She&#x2019;s experiencing the awakening of a vital force that brings woman the ability to create life. You may not know this, but the traditional name for first menstruation is &#x2018;menarche.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>Panic broke out; a swarm of moths over my heart. I no longer wanted Grace to disappear and take the last thirty seconds&#x2014;I wanted her to take my future. To take Monday, when I would have to go to school and face the fact that I was a social outcast, now and forever. To take the coming few weeks, when I would have to go about my life, pretending I didn&#x2019;t hear the whispers and snickers.<br>&#x201c;In some cultures,&#x201d; she continued, oblivious, &#x201c;menarche inspires song, dance, and celebration. In Morocco, girls receive clothes, money, and gifts. Japanese families celebrate a daughter&#x2019;s menarche by eating red rice and beans. In some parts of India, girls are given a ceremony and are dressed in the finest clothes and jewelry the family can buy. I know for you young ones it can seem embarrassing or, heaven forbid, dirty. But it&#x2019;s not. It is one of the most sacred things in the world, and not to be hidden away, but celebrated. So, in honor of Neva&#x2019;s menarche, and probably some of yours too&#x2014;&#x201d; She smiled encouragingly at my friends. &#x201c;&#x2014;I thought it might be fun to do like the Apache Indians here in North America, and&#x2014;&#x201d; She paused for effect. &#x201c;&#x2014;dance. I&#x2019;ve learned a chant and we can&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>I can&#x2019;t believe I let it go on for as long as I did. &#x201c;Mom.&#x201d;<br>Grace&#x2019;s smile remained in place as she met my eye. &#x201c;What is it, darling?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just . . . stop.&#x201d;<br>I barely breathed the words, but I know she heard them, because her smile fell like a kite from the sky on a windless day. A steely barrier formed around my heart. Yes, she&#x2019;d gone to a lot of trouble, but she&#x2019;d also left me no choice. &#x201c;Dad!&#x201d;<br>Our house was small; I knew he would hear me. And when he appeared, his frantic expression confirmed he&#x2019;d heard the urgency in my voice. He surveyed the room. The horrified faces of my friends. The abundance of red everywhere&#x2014;Grace&#x2019;s dress, the balloons, the new cushions, which amazingly, I had only just noticed. He clasped Grace&#x2019;s<br>shoulders and guided her out, despite her determined protest and genuine puzzlement.<br>But now, as Grace hovered over me, I didn&#x2019;t have Dad to help me. I turned the gift over and began to open it tentatively, starting with the tape at one end.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a puzzle, darling. You&#x2019;re not meant to unpeel every little bit of tape, you&#x2019;re meant to do this!&#x201d;<br>Grace lunged at the gift with such vigor, she rammed the table with her hip. Ice cubes tinkled. The water pitcher did a precarious dance, teetering back and forth before deciding to go down. Glass cracked; water gushed. A burst of mint filled the air. I shot to my feet as the water drenched me f...</p></p><h2>ZeroZeroZero: Look at Cocaine and All You See Is Powder. Look Through Cocaine and You See the World.</h2><p><b>From the author of the #1 international bestseller <i>Gomorrah</i> comes an&nbsp;electrifying investigation of the international cocaine trade, as vicious&nbsp;as it is powerful, and its hidden role in the global economy</b><br><br> In many countries, &#x201c;000&#x201d; flour is the finest on the market. It is hard to find, but it is soft, light, almost impalpable&#x2014;like the purest, highest quality&nbsp;grade of cocaine. <i>ZeroZeroZero</i> is also the title of Roberto&nbsp;Saviano&#x2019;s unforgettable, internationally bestselling&nbsp;exploration of the inner workings of the global&nbsp;cocaine trade&#x2014;its rules and armies, and the true&nbsp;depth of its reach into the world economy and, by&nbsp;extension, its grasp on us all.<br><br> <i>Gomorrah</i>, Saviano&#x2019;s explosive account of the&nbsp;Neapolitan mob, the Camorra, was a worldwide&nbsp;publishing sensation. It struck such a nerve with&nbsp;the Camorra that Saviano has had to live under&nbsp;twenty-four-hour police protection for more&nbsp;than eight years. During this time he has come&nbsp;to know law enforcement agencies and officials&nbsp;around the world. With their cooperation, Saviano&nbsp;has broadened his perspective to take in the entire&nbsp;global &#x201c;corporate&#x201d; entity that is the drug trade and&nbsp;the complex money-laundering operations that&nbsp;allow it to function, often with the complicity of&nbsp;the world&#x2019;s biggest banks.<br><br> The result is a truly harrowing and&nbsp;groundbreaking synthesis of intimate literary&nbsp;narrative and geopolitical analysis of one of the&nbsp;most powerful dark forces in our economy.&nbsp;Saviano tracks the shift in the cocaine trade&#x2019;s axis of&nbsp;power, from Colombia to Mexico, and relates how&nbsp;the Latin American cartels and gangs have forged&nbsp;alliances, first with the Italian crime syndicates,&nbsp;then with the Russians, Africans, and others. On&nbsp;the one hand, he charts a remarkable increase in&nbsp;sophistication as these criminal entities diversify&nbsp;into many other products and markets. On the&nbsp;other, he reveals the astonishing increase in the&nbsp;severity of violence as they have fought to protect&nbsp;and extend their power.<p>Saviano is a writer and journalist of rare&nbsp;courage and a thinker of impressive intellectual&nbsp;depth, able to see the connections between farflung&nbsp;phenomena and bind them into a single&nbsp;epic story. Most drug-war narratives feel safely&nbsp;removed from our own lives; Saviano's offers&nbsp;no such comfort. As heart racing as it is heady,&nbsp;<i>ZeroZeroZero</i> is a fusion of disparate genres into&nbsp;a brilliant new form that can rightly be called&nbsp;<i>Savianoesque</i>.</p></p><p><b>Roberto Saviano</b>&nbsp;was born in Naples in 1979. He is the author of&nbsp;<i>Gomorrah: A Personal Journey into the Violent International Empire of Naples&#x2019;s Organized Crime System</i>&nbsp;and has lived under police protection since its publication in 2006.

The people closest to you use coke. If it&#x2019;s not your mother or father, if it&#x2019;s not your brother, then it&#x2019;s your son. And if your son doesn&#x2019;t use it, your boss does. Or your boss&#x2019;s secretary, but only on Saturdays, just for fun. And if your boss doesn&#x2019;t, his wife does, to let herself go. And if not his wife, then his lover&#x2014;he gives her cocaine instead of earrings, in place of diamonds. And if they don&#x2019;t, the truck driver delivering tons of coffee to caf�s around town does; he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to hack those long hours on the road without it. And if he doesn&#x2019;t, the nurse who&#x2019;s changing your grandfather&#x2019;s catheter does. Coke makes everything seem so much easier, even the night shift. And if she doesn&#x2019;t, the painter redoing your girlfriend&#x2019;s room does; he was just curious at first but wound up deep in debt. The people who use cocaine are right here, right next to you. The police officer who&#x2019;s about to pull you over has been snorting for years, and everyone knows it, and they write anonymous letters to his chief hoping he&#x2019;ll be suspended before he screws up big time. Or the surgeon who&#x2019;s just waking up and will soon operate on your aunt. Cocaine helps him cut open six people a day. Or your divorce lawyer. Or the judge presiding over your lawsuit; he doesn&#x2019;t consider it a vice, though, just a little boost, a way to get more out of life. The cashier who hands you the lottery ticket you hope is going to change your life. The carpenter who&#x2019;s installing the cabinets that cost you a month&#x2019;s salary. Or the workman who came to put together the IKEA closet you couldn&#x2019;t figure out how to assemble on your own. If not him, then the manager of your condo building who is just about to buzz you. Or your electrician, the one who&#x2019;s in your bedroom right now, moving the outlets. The singer you are listening to to unwind, the parish priest you&#x2019;re going to talk to about finally getting confirmed because your grandson&#x2019;s getting baptized, and he&#x2019;s amazed you&#x2019;ve put it off for so long. The waiters who will work the wedding you&#x2019;re going to next Saturday; they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to last on their feet all that time if they didn&#x2019;t. If not them, then the town councillor who just approved the new pedestrian zones, and who gets his coke free in exchange for favors. The parking lot attendant who&#x2019;s happy now only when he&#x2019;s high. The architect who renovated your vacation home, the mailman who just delivered your new ATM card. If not them, then the woman at the call center who asks &#x201c;How may I help you?&#x201d; in that shrill, happy voice, the same for every caller, thanks to the white powder. If not her, your professor&#x2019;s research assistant&#x2014;coke makes him nervous. Or the physiotherapist who&#x2019;s trying to get your knee working right. Coke makes him more sociable. The forward who just scored, spoiling the bet you were winning right up until the final minutes of the game. The prostitute you go to on your way home, when you just can&#x2019;t take it anymore and need to vent. She does it so she won&#x2019;t have to see whoever is on top or under or behind her anymore. The gigolo you treated yourself to for your fiftieth birthday. You did it together. Coke makes him feel really macho. The sparring partner you train with in the ring, to lose weight. And if he doesn&#x2019;t, your daughter&#x2019;s riding instructor does, and so does your wife&#x2019;s psychologist. Your husband&#x2019;s best friend uses it, the one who&#x2019;s been hitting on you for years but whom you&#x2019;ve never liked. And if he doesn&#x2019;t, then your school principal does. Along with the janitor. And the real estate agent, who&#x2019;s late, just when you finally managed to find time to see the apartment. The security guard uses it, the one who still combs his hair over his bald spot, even though guys all shave their heads these days. And if he doesn&#x2019;t, the notary you hope you never have to go back to, he does it to avoid thinking about the alimony he has to pay his ex-wives. And if he doesn&#x2019;t, the taxi driver does; he curses the traffic but then goes all happy again. If not him, the engineer you have to invite over for dinner because he might help you get a leg up in your career. The policeman who&#x2019;s giving you a ticket, sweating profusely even though it&#x2019;s winter. The squeegee man with hollow eyes, who borrows money to buy it, or that kid stuffing flyers under windshield wipers, five at a time. The politician who promised you a commercial license, the one you and your family voted into office, and who is always nervous. The professor who failed you on your exam. Or the oncologist you&#x2019;re going to see; everybody says he&#x2019;s the best, so you&#x2019;re hoping he can save you. He feels omnipotent when he sniffs cocaine. Or the gynecologist who nearly forgets to throw away his cigarette before going in to examine your wife, who has just gone into labor. Your brother-in-law, who&#x2019;s never in a good mood, or your daughter&#x2019;s boyfriend, who always is. If not them, then the fishmonger, who proudly displays a swordfish, or the gas station attendant who spills gas on your car. He sniffs to feel young again but can&#x2019;t even put the pump away correctly anymore. Or the family doctor you&#x2019;ve known for years and who lets you cut the line because you always know just the right thing to give him at Christmas. The doorman of your building uses it, and if he doesn&#x2019;t, then your kids&#x2019; tutor does, your nephew&#x2019;s piano teacher, the costume designer for the play you&#x2019;re going to see tonight, the vet who takes care of your cat. The mayor who invited you over for dinner recently. The contractor who built your house, the author whose book you&#x2019;ve been reading before falling asleep, the anchorwoman on the evening news. But if, after you think about it, you&#x2019;re still convinced none of these people could possibly snort cocaine, you&#x2019;re either blind or you&#x2019;re lying. Or the one who uses it is you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1.</p><p>THE LESSON</p><p>&#x201c;They were all sitting around a table, right here in New York, not far from here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d; I asked instinctively.</p><p>He gave me a look that said he couldn&#x2019;t believe I was stupid enough to ask a question like that. What I was about to hear was an exchange of favors. The police had arrested a young man in Europe a few years back. A Mexican with an American passport. He was sent to New York, where they let him stew in the swamp of the underworld instead of in jail. Every now and then he&#x2019;d spill some news to keep from being arrested. Not an informer exactly, but pretty close, something that didn&#x2019;t make him feel like a rat, but not one of those silent as stone types either. The police would ask him generic questions, nothing specific enough to expose him in front of his gang. They needed him to say which way the wind was blowing, what the mood was, rumors of meetings or wars. No proof or evidence, just rumors. They&#x2019;d collect the evidence later on. But now that wasn&#x2019;t enough. The young man had recorded a speech on his iPhone at a meeting he&#x2019;d gone to. A speech that made the police uneasy. Some of them, whom I&#x2019;d known for years, wanted me to write about it somewhere, to make noise, to see what sorts of reactions it got in order to find out if the story I was about to hear really went the way the young man said it had, or if it had been staged, a little theater piece. They wanted me to shake things up in the world where those words had been uttered, where they&#x2019;d been heard.</p><p>The police officer waited for me in Battery Park, on a little jetty. No hat or dark glasses, no ridiculous disguise. He showed up in a brightly colored T-shirt and flip-flops, with a smile that said he couldn&#x2019;t wait to spill his secret. His Italian was full of dialect, but I could understand him. He wasn&#x2019;t looking for complicity of any sort; he had orders to tell me about the speech and didn&#x2019;t waste time. I remember the story perfectly; it has stayed inside me. The things we remember aren&#x2019;t stored merely in our heads; I&#x2019;m convinced that other parts of our bodies remember too. The liver, testicles, fingernails, ribs. When you hear such words, they get lodged there. Each body part sends what it remembers to the brain. More and more I realize that I remember with my stomach, which stores up the beautiful as well as the horrendous. I know that certain memories are there, because my stomach moves. My diaphragm, that membrane rooted at the very core of my body, creates waves. The diaphragm makes us pant and shudder, but it also makes us piss, defecate, and vomit. That&#x2019;s where the pushing during childbirth starts. Where everything starts. And I&#x2019;m sure there are places that collect much worse, that store up the waste. I don&#x2019;t know exactly where that place is inside of me, but I know it&#x2019;s full. My place of memories, of waste, is saturated. That might seem like a good thing, but it isn&#x2019;t. Because if the waste doesn&#x2019;t have anywhere to go it starts worming its way into places it shouldn&#x2019;t. It thrusts itself into places that collect different sorts of memories. That policeman&#x2019;s story filled up forever the part of me that remembers the worst things. Those things that resurface just when you start thinking everything&#x2019;s going better, when you start imagining you&#x2019;ll finally be able to go home, when you tell yourself it really was worth it after all. It&#x2019;s in moments like that when the dark memories resurface from somewhere, like an exhalation, like trash in a dump, buried and covered over by plastic, that somehow finds its way to the surface and poisons everything.</p><p>The police officer told me that the young man, his informer, had heard the only lesson worth learning&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what he called it&#x2014;and had recorded it on the sly. Not to betray anyone, but to be able to listen to it again. A lesson on how to be in the world. And he let the officer hear the whole thing; they listened together, sharing the young man&#x2019;s earbuds.</p><p>&#x201c;Now you have to write about it. Let&#x2019;s see if somebody gets pissed off&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which would mean that the young man&#x2019;s telling the truth. If you write about it and nobody does anything, then either it&#x2019;s just a load of crap from some B-grade actor, and our Chicano friend is making fools of us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or nobody believes the bullshit you write.&#x201d; He laughed.</p><p>I nodded without promising anything; I was just trying to understand the situation. Supposedly it was an old Italian boss talking to a group of Latinos, Italians, Italian Americans, Albanians, and former Kaibiles, the notorious Guatemalan elite soldiers. At least, that&#x2019;s what the young man said. No facts, statistics, or details. Not something you learn against your will; you just enter the room one way and you come out changed. You&#x2019;re still wearing the same clothes, have the same haircut, your beard is still the same length. No signs of being initiated, no cuts over your eyebrows, no broken nose, and you haven&#x2019;t been brainwashed with sermons either. You go in, and when you come out, at first glance you look exactly the same as when you were pushed through the door. But only on the outside. Inside you&#x2019;re completely different. They didn&#x2019;t reveal the ultimate truth to you, they merely put a few things in their proper place. Things you hadn&#x2019;t known how to use before, that you&#x2019;d never had the courage to take in.</p><p>The police officer read me the transcription he&#x2019;d made. They&#x2019;d met in a room not far from where we were, seated in no particular order, randomly, not in a horseshoe like they do at ritual initiations. Seated like they do in a club in some small town in southern Italy, or on Arthur Avenue in New York City, to watch the soccer game on TV. But there was no soccer game on TV in that room, and this was no gathering of friends. They were all members of criminal organizations, of all different ranks. The old Italian gets up. They knew he was a man of honor, that he&#x2019;d come to the United States after living in Canada for a long time. He begins talking without even introducing himself; he doesn&#x2019;t need to. He speaks a bastard Italian, some dialect thrown in, mixed with English and Spanish. I wanted to know his name, so I asked the police officer, trying to sound casual, as if it were a passing curiosity. He didn&#x2019;t bother answering me. There were only the boss&#x2019;s words.</p><p>Them folks who think they can get by with justice, with laws that are equal for everybody, with hard work, dignity, clean streets, with women same as men, it&#x2019;s only a world of fags who think it&#x2019;s okay to make fools of themselves. And everyone around them. All that crap about a better world, leave it to them idiots. To the rich idiots who can afford such luxuries. The luxury of believing in a happy world, a just world. Rich people with guilty consciences, or with something to hide. Whoever rules just does it, and that&#x2019;s that. Sure, he can say he rules for the good, for justice and liberty and all. But that&#x2019;s just sissy stuff; leave all that to the rich fools. Who rules, rules. Period.</p><p>I tried asking how he was dressed, how old he was. Cop questions, things a reporter or a nosy obsessive would ask, believing that the typology of a boss who&#x2019;d give this sort of speech can be had in the details. The police officer ignored me and kept on talking. I listened, sifting his words like sand in hopes of finding the nugget, the name. I listened to his words but was searching for something else. I was searching for clues.</p><p>&#x201c;He wanted to explain the rules to them, capish?&#x201d; the police officer said. &#x201c;He wanted them to really get into it. I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s not lying. This isn&#x2019;t some lazy Mexican wank, I&#x2019;m telling you. I swear on my life, even if no one believes me.&#x201d;</p><p>The police officer buried his nose in his notebook and started reading again.</p><p>The rules of the organization are the rules of life. Government laws are the rules of one side that wants to fuck the other side. And we ain&#x2019;t gonna let ourselves get fucked by nobody. There&#x2019;s people who make money without taking any risks, and they&#x2019;re always gonna be afraid of those who make money by risking everything. If you risk it all, you have it all, capish? But if you think you gotta save yourself, or that you can do it without jail time, without fleeing, without going into hiding, then let me make it clear right from the start: you are not a man. And if you&#x2019;re not a man, you can leave this room right now, and don&#x2019;t even hope to ever become one, &#x2019;cause you will never ever be a man of honor.</p><p>The police officer looked at me. His eyes were two narrow slits, as if he were trying to see words he remembered all too well. He had read and listened to that testimony dozens of times.</p><p><i>Crees en el amor?</i> Love ends. <i>Crees en tu coraz�n?</i> Your heart stops. No? No love and no heart? So, do you believe in <i>co�o</i>, in pussy? Well, even pussies dry up after a while. You believe in your wife? Soon as your money runs out, she&#x2019;ll tell you you&#x2019;re neglecting her. You believe in your children? As soon as you stop giving them money they&#x2019;ll say you don&#x2019;t love them. You believe in your mama?

The author&#39;s first novel introduces Harry Potter, the son of a powerful wizard and witch who are killed by an even more powerful sorcerer. Sent to live with his Muggle (non-magical) aunt, uncle, and cousin, Harry is treated poorly without knowing why. On his tenth birthday, Harry learns that he is a wizard and is to go off to Hogwarts, a prestigious school for wizards and witches. Harry and his friends, Hermione and Ron, soon discover that something shady is going on, and they must save Hogwarts from the very sorcerer who killed Harry&#39;s parents.

Rowling. (s05).</p><p>Say you've spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who loathes you. Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>. In the nonmagic human world--the world of "Muggles"--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley. <p> A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: "We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry." Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, "I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and suspenseful--begins. <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, first published in England as <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i>, continues to win major awards in England.

Psychology is the only branch of learning in which I am particularly versed. To the psychologist the religious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any other of the facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would seem, therefore, as a psychologist, the natural thing for me would be to invite you to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities."</i> <p> When William James went to the University of Edinburgh in 1901 to deliver a series of lectures on "natural religion," he defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine." Considering religion, then, not as it is defined by--or takes place in--the churches, but as it is felt in everyday life, he undertook a project that, upon completion, stands not only as one of the most important texts on psychology ever written, not only as a vitally serious contemplation of spirituality, but for many critics one of the best works of nonfiction written in the 20th century. Reading <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, it is easy to see why. Applying his analytic clarity to religious accounts from a variety of sources, James elaborates a pluralistic framework in which "the divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group of qualities, by being champions of which in alternation, different men may all find worthy missions." It's an intellectual call for serious religious tolerance--indeed, respect--the vitality of which has not diminished through the subsequent decades.</p>"<b>The Varieties of Religious Experience</b> is certainly the most notable of all books in the field of the psychology of religion and probably destined to be the most influential [one] written on religion in the twentieth century," said Walter Houston Clark in <b>Psychology Today</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The book was an immediate bestseller upon its publication in June 1902.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting the pluralistic views of psychologist-turned-philosopher William James, it posits that individual religious experiences, rather than the tenets of organized religions, form the backbone of religious life.&nbsp;&nbsp;James's discussion of conversion, repentance, mysticism, and hope of reward and fears of punishment in the hereafter--as well as his observations on the religious experiences of such diverse thinkers as Voltaire, Whitman, Emerson, Luther, Tolstoy, and others--all support his thesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;"James's characteristic humor, his ability to put down the pretentious and to be unpretentious, and his willingness to take some risks in his choices of ancedotal data or provocative theories are all apparent in the book," noted Professor Martin E. Marty.&nbsp;&nbsp;"A reader will come away with more reasons to raise new questions than to feel that old ones have been resolved."</p><h2>Cards that Pop Up, Flip &amp; Slide</h2><p><p><b>Dynamic new ideas for your handmade cards</b></p><p>Dazzle your friends and loved ones with the one-of-a-kind projects in <i>Cards that Pop Up, Flip &amp; Slide</i>.

By weaving together interviews with Corvino&#x2019;s colleagues, students, and family with archival material from the Juilliard School, the Metropolitan Opera Ballet as well as the Corvino family, Lille has created a touching portrait of this wise, fun-loving and enigmatic man. Setting Corvino&#x2019;s own story within the context of the social, political, and artistic events of his time, Lille vividly explores the many forces and challenges that shaped this artist and educator. More than 4 photos,&nbsp;many never before published,&nbsp;illustrate the various stages of Corvino&#x2019;s life. Discussions with and commentary from his daughters Andra and Ernesta elucidate his teaching theory and basic exercises. Photographs with line drawing overlays by functional anatomy teacher and former Corvino student, Irene Dowd illustrate the equipoise of Corvino&#x2019;s approach to classical ballet technique. A foreword by Dominique Mercy, leading dancer with Tanztheater Wuppertal reveals the great gift Corvino gave to dancers and dance lovers everywhere through his life work.</p><p></p><h2>The Dark Continent: Europe&#39;s Twentieth Century (Borzoi Book)</h2><p><b>Dark Continent</b> is a searching history of Europe's most brutal century. Stripping away the comforting myths and illusions that we have grown up with since the Second World War, Mark Mazower presents an unflinching account of a continent locked in a finely balanced struggle between tolerance and racial extermination, imperial ambition and national self-determination, liberty and the tyrannies of Right and Left. It is an attempt to trace the origins of "Western values"--the ideological terms we now live by--and to ask what remains of the struggles of previous generations.<br><br>Instead of seeing Europe as the natural home of freedom and democracy, Mazower argues that it was a frequently nightmarish laboratory for social and political engineering, inventing and reinventing itself through war, revolution and ideological competition. Fascism and communism should be regarded not as exceptions to the general rule of democracy, but as alternative forms of government that attracted many Europeans by offering different solutions to the challenges of the modern world. By 1940 the prospects for democratic government looked bleak, and Europe's future seemed to lie in Hitler's hands. Yet freedom was given another chance with the defeat of the Nazi New Order, and it prevailed decades later across the continent with the collapse of the Iron Curtain.<br><br>Mazower's extraordinarily skilled and insightful analysis provides us with a new perspective on the events of the century now drawing to a close. From the beginnings of the First World War to the establishment of the European Union, he depicts a battle for hearts and minds that reached more deeply than ever before into the daily lives of ordinary people. Vividly written and vigorously argued, <b>Dark Continent</b> presents both a comprehensive history of twentieth-century Europe and a provocative vision of its future.</p><p>As the European Union introduces a common currency to world financial markets, Mark Mazower's <i>Dark Continent</i> critically examines the notion of "Europe." The Euro notwithstanding, Mazower argues that the "'Europe' of the European Union may be a promise or a delusion, but it is not a reality." Renouncing the notion of an essential "Europe," Mazower instead explores the conflicts which dominated the continent in the 20th century and the social value systems which informed them.<p> Mazower orders his examination chronologically, commencing with the collapse of Europe's continental empires following World War I and the initial European experiments in democracy and national self-determination which followed. He continues with analyses of state interventions in family health and the importance of healthy progeny, the financial crisis of the 1920s, the Hitler regime, the transformed democracy that emerged following World War II, the gradual erosion of the social state in the 1980s, and, finally, the collapse of communism. He consistently displays a firm grip of European history, directing his argument to readers with a foundational knowledge of the events that shaped 20th century Europe rather than historical novices unfamiliar with the period. Provocatively insightful, <i>Dark Continent</i> makes a convincing argument for a European 21st century characterized by continuity and harmony through divergence. "If Europeans can give up their desperate desire to find a single, workable definition of themselves," Mazower concludes, "they may come to terms more easily with the diversity and dissension which will be as much their future as their past." <i>--Bertina Loeffler</i></p>"Mazower's splendid book...makes a convincing case for a different version of 20th-century European history. 'We are quite wrong,' he writes, 'to read the present back into the past, and assume--for instance--that democracy must be rooted deep in Europe's soil.'"--Tony Judt , <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"If it's the business of historians to remember what others have forgotten, Mark Mazower <br>has done his job in Dark Continent."--Roane Carey, <i>Newsday</i><br><br>"Timely, argumentative, and ultimately optimistic; Mazower is particularly good at illuminating the substance of beliefs beneath ideologies."--<i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>"A masterful account of Europe's cursed century . . .

He graduated from Harvard in 1837, the same year he began his lifelong Journal. Inspired by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau became a key member of the Transcendentalist movement that included Margaret Fuller and Bronson Alcott. The Transcendentalists' faith in nature was tested by Thoreau between 1845 and 1847 when he lived for twenty-six months in a homemade hut at Walden Pond. While living at Walden, Thoreau worked on the two books published during his lifetime: <b>Walden</b> (1854) and <b>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</b> (1849). Several of his other works, including <b>The Maine Woods, Cape Cod</b>, and <b>Excursions</b>, were published posthumously.

Assignment 1-3 What are the differences that determine the width of the river to cross? Assignment 2-1 Find a minimum of thirty observations in Acts 1:8. List them below. Avoid making interpretations or applications at this stage. That is, stay with observations. For example, an observation would be to note that the passage starts off with the conjunction &#39;but.&#39; This conjunction connects the sentence to the one above it in a contrasting way. If, however, you were to note that the Holy Spirit empowers us for evangelism, that observation falls into the category of interpretation or application. Do not enter into the interpretation or application phase yet. Limit all thirty of your observations to the details and not to the interpretation of the details.Work hard! Dig deep! Read and reread the passage. Do not quit until you have found at least thirty observations. Try to find more than thirty. Happy hunting!

Smith was raised with limitless affection and a firm belief in God by a stay-at-home mother and an engineer father. But just as Tracy is about to leave home for college, her mother is diagnosed with cancer, a condition she accepts as part of God&#x2019;s plan. <i>Ordinary Light </i>is the story of a young woman struggling to fashion her own understanding of belief, loss, history, and what it means to be black in America. <br><br>In lucid, clear prose, Smith interrogates her childhood in suburban California, her first collision with independence at Harvard, and her Alabama-born&nbsp;parents&#x2019;&nbsp;recollections of&nbsp;their own youth in the&nbsp;Civil Rights era. These dizzying juxtapositions&#x2014;of her family&#x2019;s past, her own comfortable present, and the promise of her future&#x2014;will in due course compel Tracy to act on her passions for love and &#x201c;ecstatic possibility,&#x201d; and her desire to become a writer. <br><br>Shot through with exquisite lyricism, wry humor, and an acute awareness of the beauty of everyday life, <i>Ordinary Light</i> is a gorgeous kaleidoscope of self and family, one that skillfully combines a child&#x2019;s and teenager&#x2019;s perceptions with adult retrospection. Here is a universal story of being and becoming, a classic portrait of the ways we find and lose ourselves amid the places we call home.</p></p><p>Tracy K. Smith is the United States Poet Laureate.

It had felt like night for a long time, the days at once short and ceaselessly long. November-dark. She&#x2019;d been lifting her hand to signal for relief, a code we&#x2019;d concocted once it became too much effort for her to speak and too difficult for us to understand her when she did. When it became clear that it was taking everything out of&nbsp;her just to lift the arm, we told her to blink, a movement that, when you&#x2019;re watching for it,&nbsp;becomes impossibly&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;discern.&nbsp;&#x201c;Was that&nbsp;a&nbsp;blink?&#x201d; we&#x2019;d ask when her eyelids just seemed to ripple or twitch. &#x201c;Are you blinking, Mom? Was that a blink?&#x201d; until&nbsp;finally, she&#x2019;d heave the lids up&nbsp;and let hem thud back down to say, <i>Yes, the pain weighs that much, and I am lying here, pinned beneath it.&nbsp;Do something.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Did we recognize the day when it arrived? A day with so much pain, a day when her patience had dissolved and she wanted nothing but to be outside of it.&nbsp;<i>Pain</i>.&nbsp;The word itself doesn&#x2019;t hurt enough, doesn&#x2019;t know how to tell us what it stands for. We gave her morphine. Each time she asked for it, we asked her if she was sure, and she found a way to tell us that she was, and so we were sure&#x2014;weren&#x2019;t we?&#x2014;that this&nbsp;was the end,&nbsp;this was&nbsp;when and how she would go.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was grateful for my brother Conrad and his wife, both doctors. None of the rest of us would have known how to administer the drug in such a way as to say what we needed it to say&#x2014;<i>Take this dose, measured out, controlled, a proven&nbsp;means of&nbsp;temporary relief&nbsp;</i>&#x2014;rather than what we knew it actually meant. Grateful, and hopeful that the training might stand guard against the fact that the patient was our mother.<br> &nbsp;<br> The nurse who came by each day was a cheerful person who knew not to be cheery. Calm, available, knowing, pleasant. But she stopped short of chipper. She must have been instructed not to bring that kind of feeling into a home that was preparing for death. Not to bring hope. Instead, she brought mild comfort, a commendable gentleness that helped to rebuild something inside us. The nurse cared for our mother the way we sought to care for our mother: with no signs of struggle, no stifled rage at God and the unfair world, no tears. In changing our mother&#x2019;s bandages and handling her flesh with such competence and ease, the nurse cared for us, too. Once a day for only an hour at a time, she came and eased our load just&nbsp;enough to get us to the next day when we knew she&#x2019;d come again.<br> &nbsp;<br> I had sat and read the hospice literature one morning at the dining room table. A binder with information about how to care for the dying at home. It said that as death approaches, the body&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;cool&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;touch.&nbsp;The&nbsp;limbs&nbsp;lose&nbsp;their&nbsp;warmth&nbsp;as&nbsp;the&nbsp;body&nbsp;concentrates&nbsp;its&nbsp;energy&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;essential&nbsp;functions.&nbsp;Some-times when I was alone with my mother, I&#x2019;d touch her feet and legs, checking to see how cool she had become. I was both frightened and reassured that the literature was correct, as if her body was saying goodbye to the world, preparing itself for a journey&#x2014;&nbsp;though that&#x2019;s not it, exactly, for the body goes nowhere, merely shuts down in preparation for being left. I could sense my mother leaving, getting ready for some elsewhere I couldn&#x2019;t visit, and like the cool hands and feet I&#x2019;d check for every day, it both crushed and heartened me. Every day, she spoke less, ate less, surrendered a little more of&nbsp;her presence in this world. Every day, she seemed to be more firmly aligned with a place or a state I believed in but couldn&#x2019;t decipher.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the dark outside was real&#x2014;not just the dark of&nbsp;approaching winter, and not just the dark of rain, which we&#x2019;d had for days, too&#x2014;her dying came on. We recognized it. We circled her bed, though we stopped short of holding hands, perhaps because that gesture would have meant we were holding on, and we were finally ready to let her go. Each of us took a turn saying &#x201c;I love&nbsp;you&#x201d;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&#x201c;Goodbye.&#x201d;&nbsp;We&nbsp;made&nbsp;our&nbsp;promises.&nbsp;Then&nbsp;we&nbsp;heard&nbsp;a sound that seemed to carve a tunnel between our world and some other. It was an otherworldly breath, a vivid presence that blew past us without stopping, leaving us, the living, clamped in place&nbsp;by the&nbsp;silence that&nbsp;followed. I&nbsp;would come back to&nbsp;the sound&nbsp;and the presence of that breath again and again, thinking how miraculous it was that she had ridden off on that last exhalation, her life instantly whisked away, carried over into a place none of us will ever understand&nbsp;until perhaps&nbsp;we are there ourselves.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s the kind of miracle we never let ourselves consider, the miracle of&nbsp;death. She followed that last breath wherever it led and left her body behind in&nbsp;the old four-poster Queen Anne bed,&nbsp;where for the first time in all of&nbsp;our lives it was a body and nothing more.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> After it&nbsp;was clear&nbsp;that she&nbsp;was gone, my&nbsp;sister Wanda rose&nbsp;from the floor where she&#x2019;d been sitting&#x2014;we&#x2019;d all gone from standing around her to sitting or huddling there on the rug around the bed; perhaps we had fallen to our knees in unconscious obedience to the largeness that&nbsp;had claimed&nbsp;our mother, the invisible power she had joined&#x2014;and crawled into bed beside her, nestling next to her under the covers just as we&#x2019;d all done when we were children. The act struck me then as futile. In those last many weeks, I&#x2019;d grown used to looking at my mother, changed almost daily, it seemed,&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;disease.&nbsp;And&nbsp;every&nbsp;day,&nbsp;I&#x2019;d fought&nbsp;to&nbsp;find&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;see&nbsp;her as herself, as not so very far from whom she&#x2019;d always been to me. But now she was something else altogether. Wasn&#x2019;t it obvious? The&nbsp;body already stiffening, the&nbsp;unnatural, regrettable set to the jaw, as if the spirit had exited through her mouth. Still, Wanda, the first-born,&nbsp;clung&nbsp;to&nbsp;her,&nbsp;crying,&nbsp;eyeing&nbsp;each&nbsp;of&nbsp;us&nbsp;as&nbsp;if&nbsp;to&nbsp;say,&nbsp;<i>She was mine first. Which of&nbsp;you is going&nbsp;to drag me away?&nbsp;</i>It was the type of gesture I&#x2019;d have expected my father to chastise her for, though of course he didn&#x2019;t; none of us did. He was just as undone as any of us, though he&#x2019;d done his best. In the moments after it was clear what had happened, when we found ourselves coming to in the&nbsp;bleak&nbsp;and&nbsp;unreal&nbsp;reality&nbsp;of&nbsp;her&nbsp;death,&nbsp;he&#x2019;d said&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;sisters&nbsp;and me, &#x201c;You must be brave&#x201d;&#x2014;the thing fathers tell children in old wartime movies. I&#x2019;d tried my best not to judge him as lacking in imagination, for I knew that while what he&#x2019;d said was patently unoriginal,&nbsp;it was also true. I tried not&nbsp;to judge Wanda, either, but I admit that I took her invitation to even the possibility of struggle as in questionable taste. Perhaps, after a moment, she came to the same view herself, at which point she stood up and agreed to wait upstairs with the rest of us.<br> &nbsp;<br> We all instinctively wanted the strangers who were already on their way to find our mother as presentable in death as she had always been in life, and so Conrad had agreed to stay behind to prepare the body, to change her clothes and the bed linens. He and his wife, Janet, the doctors, doing what nurses do in order to protect the shell, the empty shape, the idea of our mother from even the slightest tinge of scorn or even simply the rote disregard the attendants might&nbsp;have brought to&nbsp;their work. He&#x2019;d cried doing it. Readying her to be taken away had been his moment of&nbsp;realization, his&nbsp;genuine goodbye.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was a moment when I found myself alone with her in the room. Had I&nbsp;crept back down to steal a last look,&nbsp;or had we all agreed to give one another that much? It&#x2019;s been twenty years now.&nbsp; I&#x2019;ve forgotten so much that I once forbade myself to forget, but I do remember this: snipping five or seven strands of her hair with a pair of nail scissors from her bureau. Just a few short hairs from the nape of her neck. Suddenly, those few strands, things I&#x2019;d have once thought nothing of brushing off her shoulders or discarding from among the tines of&nbsp;a hairbrush, were consecrated, a host. For a moment, I contemplated eating them, but then they&#x2019;d be gone and I&#x2019;d have been left with nothing, so I placed them in a small plastic bag, the kind of&nbsp;bag in which spare threads or extra buttons are provided when you purchase a&nbsp;sweater or coat, and tucked&nbsp;that into the flap of&nbsp;my address book.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br></p></p><h2>Wounded by God&#39;s People</h2><p><p>Tucked into Abraham&#x2019;s biography is the story of Hagar, a young Egyptian slave with whom Abraham had a son named Ishmael.&nbsp; Hagar stood out because she was wounded&#x2015;not physically, but in ways that were as emotionally and spiritually painful as any injury to a body would be.

While Anne identifies with the wounded, the unpleasant reality is that she also identifies with the wounders, because she has been one, too.&nbsp; She knows from experience that wounding is a cycle that needs to be broken.&nbsp; And by God&#x2019;s grace, it can be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many have had similar experiences.

Badden was the greatest of them; no creature alive was more connected to those magics than this man. So while he stood upon hundreds of feet of solid ice, he felt, too, the earth below that freeze, where the hot springs ran. Those very springs had led him to this place, and as he neared the edge of the glacier, the wide expanse of Alpinador opening before him, the old Samhaist trembled with excitement.<br>He knew.<br>He knew before he glanced down from the edge of the glacier that he had found it: Mithranidoon, the steamy lake of legend, the place where the god Samhain forsook his mortal coil and melted down into the earth, the source of all magic, the guardian of eternity. Samhain&#x2019;s servant was Death, men like Badden believed, who would bring the souls to the harsh judgment of the god who suffered no fool.<br>It was a clear morning. When Badden looked down his breath fell away from him, and many heartbeats passed before he could catch it once more. Below him was a fog-shrouded, huge, warm lake, perhaps twenty miles long and half that wide.<br>Mithranidoon.<br>The old man smiled at the rarely seen sight. He had found the holiest of Samhaist places and the source of his greatest magic just as his war with the Abellicans in Vanguard to the south had begun to ignite.<br>&#x201c;Dame Gwydre,&#x201d; he mouthed, referring to the leader of the men of Vanguard. &#x201c;You chose poorly in taking an Abellican as your lover.&#x201d; He ended with a chuckle, and no aged wheeze could be detected in the voice of the strong man, however many decades had passed since his birth. Most who knew him&#x2014;or knew of him, for few actually knew Badden in any real way&#x2014;believed that eight full decades and part of the ninth were behind him.<br>Ancient Badden slowly turned about to survey the area. He could feel Mithranidoon&#x2019;s strength keenly now that he had confirmed the location. Mithranidoon had beaten the glacier, and her power permeated the standing ice. He could feel it in his feet.<br>This place would serve, he thought, continuing his scan. Up here on the glacier he had easy access to the low mountain passes that would get him to the roads leading south into Vanguard. The vantage also afforded him solid defense against any advancing armies, though he recognized that no hostile army would ever get anywhere near to him. Not here, not with Mithranidoon feeding him her power.<br>&#x201c;Mithranidoon,&#x201d; the old man said with great reverence, as if merely glimpsing the place from afar was enough to validate his entire existence, his sixty years as a Samhaist priest. But it wasn&#x2019;t enough, he realized suddenly, and he looked up to the heavens.<br>&#x201c;You, there!&#x201d; he said loudly, lifting his hand toward a distant, circling crow.<br>The bird heard him and could not ignore the call. Immediately it turned and swooped, speeding down, upturning its wings at the last moment to light gently on Ancient Badden&#x2019;s outstretched hand.<br>&#x201c;I would see below the mists,&#x201d; the old Samhaist whispered to the bird. Badden stroked his hand over the crow&#x2019;s face and closed his own eyes. &#x201c;To the scar Samhain rent in the earth.&#x201d;<br>Suddenly Badden launched the crow with the flick of his hand, his eyes tightly shut for he did not need them anymore. Ancient Badden saw through the eyes of the crow. The bird followed his instructions perfectly, sweeping down from the glacier, soaring vertically the hundreds of feet before it straightened out and rushed across the lake, barely a tall man&#x2019;s height above the water.<br>Ancient Badden took it all in: the caves of the trolls, lining the bank; the multitude of islands, dozens and dozens, some no more than a few rocks jutting above the steamy waters, others large and forested. One of those, particularly large and tree-covered, was dotted with huts of the general design common to the barbarians of the region, though not nearly as fortified against the elements as those found on the Alpinadoran tundra. Sure enough he spotted the tribesmen, large and strong, decorated with necklaces of claws and teeth, though, as they resided on a warm lake, they wore far less clothing than the average Alpinadoran barbarian.<br>Badden fell within himself and experienced the warm air coming off the spring-fed lake, warming the wings of his host.<br>So the barbarians had dared to inhabit this holy place. He nodded, wondering if he could somehow enlist them in his battles against Gwydre. Some tribes had joined him, if only for brief excursions against the Southerners, but none of those occasions had gone as Badden would have hoped. These Northerners, the Alpinadorans, were a stubborn lot, predictable only in their ferocity and wedded to traditions too fully for Badden to hold much sway over them.<br>The old Ancient chuckled and reminded himself why it was important for him to keep his eyes turned southward, toward the northern Honce province of Vanguard and to Honce proper herself. These were his people, his flock, the civilized men and women who had followed the Samhaist ways for centuries. They had followed unquestioningly until the upstart Abelle had brought them false promises in the days when Badden was but a child.<br>The Samhaist let those unpleasant thoughts go and basked again in the beauty of Mithranidoon, but he winced soon after as the crow continued its glide over an almost barren lump of rock. Almost barren, but not uninhabited, he saw as the bird sped past. It pained the old man greatly to see powries, red-capped dwarves, settled upon the lake.<br>But even that could not prepare him for the next sight, and when the bird passed another of the islands, Badden noted a familiar-looking design well under construction. Even here, they had come! Even in this most holy of Samhaist locations, the Abellican heretics had ventured and now seemed as if they meant to stay.<br>So shocked was Badden that he lost connection to the bird, and he staggered so badly that he nearly toppled from the edge of the glacier.<br>&#x201c;This cannot stand,&#x201d; he muttered over and over again.<br>His mind was already whirling, calculating, searching for how he might cleanse Mithranidoon of this awful infection. All thoughts of enlisting the barbarians on the lake dissipated from him. They were all unclean. They all had to die.<br>&#x201c;This will not stand,&#x201d; Ancient Badden declared, and in all his many years as leader of the Samhaists he had never once made such a declaration without seeing it to fruition.&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2008 by R.

How else could I account for the fact that years ago, right after the accident -- when the smoke cleared and the car had stopped tumbling end over end to rest upside down in a ditch -- I was still alive; I could hear Elizabeth, my little girl, crying? The police officer who had pulled me out of the car rode with me to the hospital to have my broken leg set, with Elizabeth -- completely unhurt, a miracle -- sitting on his lap the whole time. He'd held my hand when I was taken to identify my husband Jack's body. He came to the funeral. He showed up at my door to personally inform me when the drunk driver who ran us off the road was arrested. </p><p> The policeman's name was Kurt Nealon. Long after the trial and the conviction, he kept coming around just to make sure that Elizabeth and I were all right. He brought toys for her birthday and Christmas. He fixed the clogged drain in the upstairs bathroom. He came over after he was off duty to mow the savannah that had once been our lawn. </p><p> I had married Jack because he was the love of my life; I had planned to be with him forever. But that was before the definition of forever was changed by a man with a blood alcohol level of .22. </p><p> I was surprised that Kurt seemed to understand that you might never love someone as hard as you had the first time you'd fallen; I was even more surprised to learn that maybe you <i>could</i>. </p><p> Five years later, when Kurt and I found out we were going to have a baby, I almost regretted it -- the same way you stand beneath a perfect blue sky on the most glorious day of the summer and admit to yourself that all moments from here on in couldn't possibly measure up. Elizabeth had been two when Jack died; Kurt was the only father she'd ever known. They had a connection so special it sometimes made me feel I should turn away, that I was intruding. If Elizabeth was the princess, then Kurt was her knight. </p><p> The imminent arrival of this little sister (how strange is it that none of us ever imagined the new baby could be anything but a girl?) energized Kurt and Elizabeth to fever pitch. Elizabeth drew elaborate sketches of what the baby's room should look like. Kurt hired a contractor to build the addition. But then the builder's mother had a stroke and he had to move unexpectedly to Florida; none of the other crews had time to fit our job into their schedules before the baby's birth. We had a hole in our wall and rain leaking through the attic ceiling; mildew grew on the soles of our shoes. </p><p> When I was seven months pregnant, I came downstairs to find Elizabeth playing in a pile of leaves that had blown past the plastic sheeting into the living room. I was deciding between crying and raking my carpet when the doorbell rang. </p><p> He was holding a canvas roll that contained his tools, something that never left his possession, like another man might tote around his wallet. His hair brushed his shoulders and was knotted. His clothes were filthy and he smelled of snow -- although it wasn't the right season. Shay Bourne arrived, unexpected, like a flyer from a summer carnival that blusters in on a winter wind, making you wonder just where it's been hiding all this time. </p><p> He had trouble speaking -- the words tangled, and he had to stop and unravel them before he could say what he needed to say. "I want to..." he began, and then started over: "Do you, is there, because..." The effort made a fine sweat break out on his forehead. "Is there anything I can do?" he finally managed, as Elizabeth came running toward the front door. </p><p> <i>You can leave</i>, I thought. I started to close the door, instinctively protecting my daughter. "I don't think so..." </p><p> Elizabeth slipped her hand into mine and blinked up at him. "There's a lot that needs to be fixed," she said. </p><p> He got down to his knees then and spoke to my daughter easily -- words that had been full of angles and edges for him a minute before now flowed like a waterfall. "I can help," he replied. </p><p> Kurt was always saying people are never who you think they are, that it was necessary to get a complete background check on a person before you made any promises. I'd tell him he was being too suspicious, too much the cop. After all, I had let Kurt himself into my life simply because he had kind eyes and a good heart, and even he couldn't argue with the results. </p><p> "What's your name?" I asked. </p><p> "Shay. Shay Bourne." </p><p> "You're hired, Mr. Bourne," I said, the beginning of the end. <b></b></p><p><b> SEVEN MONTHS LATER </b> </p><p> <b>Michael</b> </p><p> Shay Bourne was nothing like I expected. </p><p> I had prepared myself for a hulking brute of a man, one with hammy fists and no neck and eyes narrowed into slits. This was, after all, the crime of the century -- a double murder that had captured the attention of people from Nashua to Dixville Notch; a crime that seemed all the worse because of its victims: a little girl, and a police officer who happened to be her stepfather. It was the kind of crime that made you wonder if you were safe in your own house, if the people you trusted could turn on you at any moment -- and maybe because of this, New Hampshire prosecutors sought the death penalty for the first time in fifty-eight years. </p><p> Given the media blitz, there was talk of whether twelve jurors who hadn't formed a reaction to this crime could even be found, but they managed to locate us. They unearthed me in a study carrel at UNH, where I was writing a senior honors thesis in mathematics. I hadn't had a decent meal in a month, much less read a newspaper -- and so I was the perfect candidate for Shay Bourne's capital murder case. </p><p> The first time we filed out of our holding pen -- a small room in the superior courthouse that would begin to feel as familiar as my apartment -- I thought maybe some bailiff had let us into the wrong courtroom. This defendant was small and delicately proportioned -- the kind of guy who grew up being the punch line to high school jokes. He wore a tweed jacket that swallowed him whole, and the knot of his necktie squared away from him at the perpendicular, as if it were being magnetically repelled. His cuffed hands curled in his lap like small animals; his hair was shaved nearly to the skull. He stared down at his lap, even when the judge spoke his name and it hissed through the room like steam from a radiator. </p><p> The judge and the lawyers were taking care of housekeeping details when the fly came in. I noticed this for two reasons: in March, you don't see many flies in New Hampshire, and I wondered how you went about swatting one away from you when you were handcuffed and chained at the waist. Shay Bourne stared at the insect when it paused on the legal pad in front of him, and then in a jangle of metal, he raised his bound hands and crashed them down on the table to kill it. </p><p> Or so I thought, until he turned his palms upward, his fingers opened one petal at a time, and the insect went zipping off to bother someone else. </p><p> In that instant, he glanced at me, and I realized two things: </p><p> 1. He was terrified.<br> 2. He was approximately the same age that I was.<br> </p><p> This double murderer, this monster, looked like the water polo team captain who had sat next to me in an economics seminar last semester. He resembled the deliveryman from the pizza place that had a thin crust, the kind I liked. He even reminded me of the boy I'd seen walking in the snow on my way to court, the one I'd rolled down my window for and asked if he wanted a ride. In other words, he didn't look the way I figured a killer would look, if I ever ran across one. He could have been any other kid in his twenties. He could have been me. </p><p> Except for the fact that he was ten feet away, chained at the wrists and ankles. And it was my job to decide whether or not he deserved to live. <b></b></p><p><b> * * * </b> </p><p> A month later, I could tell you that serving on a jury is nothing like you see on TV. There was a lot of being paraded back and forth between the courtroom and the jury room; there was bad food from a local deli for lunch; there were lawyers who liked to hear themselves talk, and trust me, the DAs were never as hot as the girl on <i>Law &amp; Order: SVU</i>. Even after four weeks, coming into this courtroom felt like landing in a foreign country without a guidebook...and yet, I couldn't plead ignorant just because I was a tourist. I was expected to speak the language fluently. </p><p> Part one of the trial was finished: we had convicted Bourne. The prosecution presented a mountain of evidence proving Kurt Nealon had been shot in the line of duty, attempting to arrest Shay Bourne after he'd found him with his stepdaughter, her underwear in Bourne's pocket. June Nealon had come home from her OB appointment to find her husband and daughter dead. The feeble argument offered up by the defense -- that Kurt had misunderstood a verbally paralyzed Bourne; that the gun had gone off by accident -- didn't hold a candle to the overwhelming evidence presented by the prosecution. Even worse, Bourne never took the stand on his own behalf -- which could have been because of his poor language skills...or because he was not only guilty as sin but such a wild card that his own attorneys didn't trust him. </p><p> We were now nearly finished with part two of the trial -- the sentencing phase -- or in other words, the part that separated this trial from every other criminal murder trial for the past half century in New Hampshire. Now that we knew Bourne had committed the crime, did he deserve the death penalty? </p><p> This part was a little like a <i>Reader's Digest</i> condensed version of the first one. The prosecution gave a recap of evidence presented during the criminal trial; and then the defense got a chance to garner sympathy for a murderer. We learned that Bourne had been bounced around the foster care system. That when he was sixteen, he set a fire in his foster home and spent two years in a juvenile detention facility. He had untreated bipolar disorder, central aud...</p></p><h2>A Day at the Beach (Pictureback(R))</h2><p>A family spends the day at the beach where they swim, build sand castles, explore the tide pools, watch birds, and identify many forms of marine plant and animal life.

In this fascinating account of Cochrane's life, David Cordingly, author of the bestselling <i>Under the Black Flag </i>and<i> The Billy Ruffian</i>, unearths startling new details about the real-life "Master and Commander," from his daring exploits against the French navy to his role in the liberation of Chile, Peru, and Brazil, and the shock exchange scandal that forced him out of England and almost ended his naval career. Drawing on previously unpublished papers, his own travels, wide reading, and the kind of original research that distinguished <i>The Billy Ruffian</i>, Cordingly tells the rip-roaring story of the archetypal Romantic hero who conquered the seas and, in the process, defined his era.</p></p><p><p><b>David Cordingly</b> was Keeper of Pictures and Head of Exhibitions at the National Maritime Museum for twelve years, where he organized such exhibitions as "Captain James Cook, Navigator," "The Mutiny on the Bounty," and "Pirates: Fact and Fiction."

Broadsides, fire ship attacks, and the lee shore in heavy winds offered doom or prize money to the British sailors who took the risks. John Lee�s deep, booming voice and skill with every accent make him the ideal narrator for an audiobook swimming in a sea of nineteenth-century nautical words. His well-oiled British English segues into Scots for the captain and into French and Spanish for the ships and ports.

Tour.</p><p>Why do poets and artists so often disparage science in their work? For that matter, why does so much scientific literature compare poorly with, say, the phone book? After struggling with questions like these for years, biologist Richard Dawkins has taken a wide-ranging view of the subjects of meaning and beauty in <i>Unweaving the Rainbow</i>, a deeply humanistic examination of science, mysticism, and human nature. Notably strong-willed in a profession of bet-hedgers and wait-and-seers, Dawkins carries the reader along on a romp through the natural and cultural worlds, determined that "science, at its best, should leave room for poetry."<p> Inspired by the frequently asked question, "Why do you bother getting up in the morning?" following publication of his book <i>The Selfish Gene</i>, Dawkins set out determined to show that understanding nature's mechanics need not sap one's zest for life. Alternately enlightening and maddening, <i>Unweaving the Rainbow</i> will appeal to all thoughtful readers, whether wild-eyed technophiles or grumpy, cabin-dwelling Luddites. Excoriations of newspaper astrology columns follow quotes from Blake and Shakespeare, which are sandwiched between sparkling, easy-to-follow discussions of probability, behavior, and evolution. In Dawkins's world (and, he hopes, in ours), science <i>is</i> poetry; he ends his journey by referring to his title's author and subject, maintaining that "A Keats and a Newton, listening to each other, might hear the galaxies sing." <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Richard Dawkins taught zoology at the University of California at Berkeley and at Oxford University and is now the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, a position he has held since 1995.

Don&#x2019;t you have to carry a little kit around? Shoot yourself up with the antidote?&#x201d;<br><br>Paula rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Luckily, I&#x2019;ve never had to use it as an adult. Mom shot me up once. I suppose I could do it, but it just creeps me right out.&#x201d; She playfully lunged for Harry. &#x201c;I could hit you up, though.&#x201d;<br><br>As they all laughed, Nita Vitebsk, the treasurer of the group, older than the others, in her mid-fifties, pushed her polka-dot reading specs up on the bridge of her nose, bringing them back to business. &#x201c;The runners&#x2019; entry fees have paid for all our expenses. Those are the pre-entry fees, to be exact. You know we&#x2019;re going to pick up more entries, and Harry, since you&#x2019;re the check-in girl, you have the happy task of toting up the sums.&#x201d;<br><br>The group of women, this Wednesday evening, April 14, sat cross-legged in a circle on the floor, bracelets in the middle, along with most of the numbers to be worn on runners&#x2019; backs. They had been working on this project since last year&#x2019;s run.<br><br>Every year, the oncology department of Central Virginia Hospital offered staff support, and individual physicians wrote personal checks, too. The nominal head of the 5K run was Dr. Cory Schaeffer, a surgeon specializing in cancer as well as new therapies for healing. As he was developing a large reputation, his name on the fund-raising letterhead was a plus. He didn&#x2019;t do the scut work, nor did most of the other doctors, understandably enough. Dr. Jennifer Potter, the new kid on the block, actually came to some meetings, as did Dr. Annalise Veronese, a pathologist. Annalise said that as she personally witnessed the ravages of cancer in a way others did not, she especially wanted a cure. Many doctors would be at the run, as would the media. The group could thank Alicia Palmer for that. The former movie star wheedled the media into cooperation. Then again, she could pretty much wheedle anyone into cooperation as she remained a dazzler, even in her mid-fifties.<br><br>The run would go off the first Saturday after April 15, a date picked because spring would be in its initial blush. Also, it would take people&#x2019;s minds off the financial horrors of April 15. The other factor was that it usually was quite cool in the morning--mid-forties to low fifties, often warming to the mid-sixties--perfect weather for a run.<br><br>All the high school cross-country teams participated. The University of Virginia made a showing, too, unless there was an ACC track meet. Charlottesville nurtured a dedicated running club, and the members turned out in full force. Nadine &#x201c;Noddy&#x201d; Cespedes urged all her members at Heavy Metal Gym to run. Every year, the race had a big turnout. As it was one of the first celebrations of the spring, the public especially enjoyed it. The streets of the town were closed for three hours, and people lined the sidewalks, many offering drinks or towels. Volunteers dutifully grabbed the empty bottles and towels when runners stretched out their arms. Everyone felt as if they were part of the event. The police liked the run, as did the sheriff&#x2019;s department.<br><br>The city of Charlottesville funded its own police department. The county, Albemarle, kept a sheriff&#x2019;s department. The city and county were separate political entities. They cooperated with each other, but in many ways the two law enforcement groups faced different problems. The city police confronted endless fender benders as traffic increased each year. Certain &#x201c;businessmen&#x201d; from other countries moved in to sell hard drugs. In a wealthy city of 42,000, this was hardly surprising. The city did have its poor sections, along with the problems universally associated with poverty. The police department never had enough money, no surprise there.<br><br>This problem was shared by the county sheriff. Money was ever in short supply, yet people needed more services. However, country folks are less demanding, most times, than city folks. Sheriff Rick Shaw and his officers also faced traffic problems, but often enough they involved as many deer as humans. And all too often the county&#x2019;s twisty narrow roads sent many a drunken speeder to his or her death. Unfortunately, these drunks often took other innocents with them.<br><br>Another distinctive problem for the county was meth. More of this drug circulated here than in the city. The labs could be set up in the back of a van if the &#x201c;cooker&#x201d; knew what she or he was doing. Didn&#x2019;t matter that drugstores limited the sale of Sudafed and the like, which contained the pseudoephedrine used in making meth. The people making it never seemed to run out of supplies. Then, too, illegal distilleries abounded because of the pure water running off the Blue Ridge Mountains. While Albemarle County boasted of some folks who could turn out what is called &#x201c;country waters,&#x201d; Nelson County felt their county produced premier products.<br><br>When the sheriff&#x2019;s people weren&#x2019;t chasing the &#x201c;white dog,&#x201d; another name for country waters, they faced the usual quota of domestic abuse, suicide, and thefts. To call country waters moonshine marked one as an outsider. Meant you&#x2019;d never be able to buy it.<br><br>This amused both the police department and the sheriff&#x2019;s department. Sooner or later the sterling reputation for the local product&#x2019;s quality reached a newcomer&#x2019;s ears. They wanted a sip but couldn&#x2019;t find it. After determining that they weren&#x2019;t law enforcement or a plant, a bighearted local usually found a drop for them. A regular customer was born.<br><br>Perhaps all these things made the wholesome 5K something both law enforcement agencies liked. Closing the streets was preferable to their normal duties. The other reason they liked it? Many officers ran in the race.<br><br>This year, Deputy Cynthia Cooper--&#x201c;Coop&#x201d; to her buddies--Harry&#x2019;s next-door neighbor, suggested that each participant from the sheriff&#x2019;s department wear an armband with an outline of his or her badge.<br><br>Truth was, all those men and women in law enforcement--like everyone else--knew what cancer could do. The horrible disease seemed to miss no family, or any profession, leaving behind loved ones who had watched the painful struggle. A law enforcement officer fixes things, but you can&#x2019;t fix cancer.<br><br>Of the group of women who&#x2019;d worked to pull this together for the last five months, cancer had savaged their lives as well. Each of them had lost someone--a parent, a sibling, a co-worker, or, worst of all, a child--to the disease. A few had battled the disease themselves and won.<br><br>Harry decided not to fuss about the bracelets but to make a huge pink sign advertising them. Every participant received a bracelet, but Paula had wanted extras so people could buy them as a sign of support. Harry--who agonized over every expenditure, thereby driving her friends and her husband to distraction--couldn&#x2019;t quite grasp that a non-runner would purchase a pink rubber bracelet.<br><br>Committee work finished, Alicia and BoomBoom brought out the food and drinks. Their strict rule was no gossip, eating, or imbibing until the official work was done. This removed extraneous chat. All was accomplished in a timely manner, a small miracle, given the human propensity for useless chatter.<br><br>Alicia&#x2019;s dog, Max, tried to keep awake as they worked but had fallen asleep on the floor next to Alicia. When she rose, Max raised his head, bounced up, and followed the person he loved into the kitchen.<br><br>Each committee meeting was held at a different member&#x2019;s house. This spread out the cost of entertaining, but it also drew the group closer. When you see someone&#x2019;s furniture, pictures, the colors they chose for fabrics and the walls, you gain insight into them. Granted, most of these people had known one another from grade school. Others, like Alicia, had lived in the area off and on for thirty years. Nita Vitebsk was a sixteen-year resident. Toni Enright was originally from Harrisonburg, so she fit right in. Paula Benton, there for two years, was such a sunny personality that the ladies in the group had a hard time remembering when she had first come into their lives. Somehow it seemed she was always there.<br><br>Alicia&#x2019;s subdued and elegant home reflected her tastes and her income. Any woman who has a Munnings on the wall can&#x2019;t be poor. Sir Alfred Munnings&#x2019;s canvases, the larger ones, routinely sold for two million and some for more. However, you never felt overpowered or smothered by Alicia&#x2019;s money. Her home warmly enveloped you.<br></p><h2>The Boat</h2><p>Follows the patrols, waits, and attacks, through the crucial fall and winter of 1941, of the German U-boat UA VII-C and its crew, as they endure their shadowy, isolated, and claustrophobic inner and outer worlds</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Art In Nature</h2><p>This is a &#39;new&#39; Tove Jansson, published for the first time in English.

An elderly caretaker at a large outdoor exhibition, called Art in Nature, finds that a couple have lingered on to bicker about the value of a picture; he has a surprising suggestion that will resolve both their row and his own ambivalence about the art market. A draughtsman&#39;s obsession with drawing locomotives provides a dark twist to a love story. A cartoonist takes over the work of a colleague who has suffered a nervous breakdown only to discover that his own sanity is in danger. In these witty, sharp, often disquieting stories, Tove Jansson reveals the fault-lines in our relationship with art, both as artists and as consumers. Obsession, ambition, and the discouragement of critics are all brought into focus in these wise and cautionary tales.</p><p>The writer and artist Tove Jansson (1914-2001) is best known as the creator of the Moomin stories, which have been published in thirty-five languages.

Once the feudal structure of the church is recognized, the bishops' response to the clergy abuse crisis comes into focus. Bishops and other church authorities reacted to the scandal the only way their feudal culture allowed--with secrecy, denial, and a no holds barred effort to protect the reputation, authority, and resources of the institution. While tragic, and in many cases reprehensible, their response was consistent with the way feudal systems function.</p><p>In <i>Faith That Dares to Speak</i>, Donald Cozzens addresses the laity's role in challenging a feudal church to embrace accountability and transparency and to bring light where there is now darkness. Awakened to their dignity and responsibility as full, equal, and adult members of the church, lay Catholics in North America are finding their voice and daring to speak to church authorities long accustomed to deferential obedience and compliance.</p><p>Church life, Cozzens believes, will never be quite the same.</p><p>The current crisis in the Church, while profoundly disturbing and troubling, offers possibilities for a renewed and revitalized Church.

At the same time, this book is different because more than simply revisit the pedophilia problem, it points out what the church must do to rebuild its place and moral suasion in this culture at this time. It puts its finger on the weaknesses of the system that led to this kind of internal debacle and names the pieces that must be replaced if the church is to rise from this scandal stronger than ever. It is easy for an institution to ignore this kind of social audit because it calls for more than public relations strategies; it calls for a total review of principles, purpose and internal practices. But you get the idea as you read it, that though ignore it we may, we do so at our peril. This book is a gift to the church.

There&#x2019;s no way that two hundred-plus years later, the right-wing ideologues know how to interpret the Constitution. On their way home from Philadelphia the people who wrote it couldn&#x2019;t agree on what it meant. What was the president&#x2019;s job? Who knew? All they knew was that the president was going to be George Washington and as long as he was in charge, that was good enough. When Hamilton wanted to start a national bank, Madison told him that it was unconstitutional. Both men had been in the room when the Constitution was written. And now today there are politicians and judges who claim that <i>they</i> know the original meaning of the Constitution. Are you kidding?<br> <br>In <i>The Grouchy Historian, </i>Ed Asner leads the charge for liberals to reclaim the Constitution from the right-wingers who use it as their justification for doing whatever terrible thing they want to do, which is usually to comfort the comfortable and afflict the afflicted.

Conservatives love the Constitution, invoking its very name&#x2014;even more than the Bible and Ronald Reagan&#x2014;as all the proof they need that God is on their side. It&#x2019;s not enough that they think they own the Constitution; they act as if they wrote the damn thing.<br> <br>In fact, frat boys, listening to Republican candidates, have invented a new way to get drunk: every time they hear the word Constitution, they down another shot of J�germeister.I<br> <br>The Constitution is the cornerstone of the Republican party&#x2019;s agenda, along with small government, less regulation, and making sure the rich pay less taxes than the rest of us.<br> <br>Republicans are supported by a phalanx of Right-Wing radio and TV hosts who wave the Constitution at us like so many brainwashed Chinese once lofted copies of Chairman Mao&#x2019;s Little Red Book.<br> <br>Mark Levin and Glenn Beck have made small fortunes publishing books that rewrite the Constitution to suit themselves.

Besides, if the Righties were wrong about everything else&#x2014;like health care, climate change, and the corporate tax rate&#x2014;they had to be wrong about the Constitution.<br> <br>First, I did my homework. I read the Constitution and the amendments; perused The FederalistV and Madison&#x2019;s notes taken during the Constitutional Convention; surveyed the lives of the Founders and FramersVI; looked over the Supreme Court opinions of Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas; and even tried to digest Glenn Beck&#x2019;s The Original Argument, Mark Levin&#x2019;s The Liberty Amendments, and Dr. Ben Carson&#x2019;s A More Perfect Union&#x2014;three of the best over-the-counter sleep aids on the market. To find out how the mind of a strict constructionist works, I also dipped into Ted Cruz&#x2019;s autobiography, A Time for Truth, a faith-based romance novel in which the hero falls in love with himself at an early age.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Here is a preview of what I came up with:<br> <br>The Framers wrote the Constitution in order to form a strong central government, giving sweeping powers to Congress (not the states) and balanced by an equally strong executive branch.<br> <br>Nothing in the Constitution suggests, let alone enforces, the concepts of limited government, limited taxes, and limited regulations.<br> <br>The Framers were not divinely inspired.

I come to the subject as a citizen with my own strong point of view, believing that &#x201c;objective historian&#x201d; is a contradiction in terms, like &#x201c;compassionate conservative&#x201d; or &#x201c;Fox News.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nor do I pretend to be a professional scholar&#x2014;which might explain why not every quote is letter perfect or exactly endnoted.IX For that, I have to blame my inexperienced research assistant, who also happens to be me.<br> <br>But you will be happy to know that I did read some of the best historians and Constitutional scholars in the business.

It recounts how Solomon Northup, born a free man in New York, was lured to Washington, D.C., in 1841 with the promise of fast money, then drugged and beaten and sold into slavery. He spent the next twelve years of his life in captivity on a Louisiana cotton plantation.<br>&nbsp;<br>After his rescue, Northup published this exceptionally vivid and detailed account of slave life. It became an immediate bestseller and today is recognized for its unusual insight and eloquence as one of the very few portraits of American slavery produced by someone as educated as Solomon Northup, or by someone with the dual perspective of having been both a free man and a slave.</p><p>This story of the abduction of a free Negro adult from the North and his enslavement in the South--provides a sensational element which cannot be matched in any of the dozens of narratives written by former slaves. &#39;Think of it: For thirty years a man, wit all man&#39;s hopes, fears and aspirations--with a wife and children to call him by the endearing names of husband and father--with a home, humble it may be, but still a home...then for twelve years a thing, a chattel personal, classed with mules and horses....Oh! it is horrible. It chills the blood to think that such are.&#39;<b>Solomon Northup</b> (1808&#x2013;c. 1863) was a free man kidnapped and forced into slavery in 1851.

This fun tradition began in 2001 in Adams County, Ohio, where Donna Sue Groves painted a quilt block on the family&#39;s barn to honor her mother, an avid quilter. The local community joined in and soon painted quilt blocks on their barns. These barns have now become tourist&#39;s attractions with maps pinpointing each barn location. Learn a variety of new techniques as Eleanor demonstrates how to make the pieced barn blocks, each with a miniature quilt block pattern. Full color pictures of sample quilts will inspire and give guidance for fabric choices. The book includes patterns for twenty blocks ranging in size from three to eighteen inches. Bonus projects for one-block repeat patterns round out this fun Sampler quilt.</p><p>Thirty years ago, Eleanor Burns introduced her first Quilt in a Day book, beginning a quilt-making revolution. She invited all types of sewers to participate in an age-old tradition using her unique style�&#x20ac;&#x201d;a diverse combination of cutting and sewing applications that replaced scissors and templates with rips and strips, bringing rotary speed to patchwork. She also introduced an incredibly rapid stitching system, applying the method of the assembly line sewing to piecework. She has authored over eighty additional books that sell at a rate of well over 6,500 per week. She has trained thousands of instructors throughout the world who teach her quilt-making methods. In 1990, Eleanor pioneered the way people view quilt making with television. Her Quilt in a Day TV series began airing on PBS and is still broadcasting nationwide and abroad. She has also developed her own signature fabric lines, several special-edition sewing machines, and received numerous awards and recognition for her lifetime of achievements.</p><h2>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Foundations of the Unity of Science, Vol. 2, No. 2)</h2><p>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is a landmark in intellectual history which has attracted attention far beyond its own immediate field. It is written with a combination of depth and clarity that make it an almost unbroken series of aphorisms. Its author, Thomas S. Kuhn, wastes little time on demolishing the logical empiricist view of science as an objective progression toward the truth. Instead he erects from ground up a structure in which science is seen to be heavily influenced by nonrational procedures, and in which new theories are viewed as being more complex than those they usurp but not as standing any closer to the truth. Science is not the steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge that is portrayed in the textbooks. Rather, it is a series of peaceful interludes punctuated by intellectually violent revolutions . . . in each of which one conceptual world view is replaced by another.</p><p>Since the publication of this book in 1962, Kuhn&#39;s writings (and many of his ideas, such as &#34;paradigm shift&#34;) have been highly influential in academic and popular discourse. This book is must-reading for anyone studying the history and philosophy of science specifically, or cultural or technological change generally.<b>Thomas S. Kuhn</b> was the Laurence Rockefeller Professor Emeritus of linguistics and philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His books include <i>The Essential Tension; Black-Body Theory and the </i><i>Quantum Discontinuity, 1894-1912;</i> and <i>The Copernican </i><i>Revolution.</i>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Princess Diaries (Princess Diaries, 1)</h2><p>She's just a New York City girl living with her artist mom...<p>News Flash: Dad is prince of Genovia.

Even though she lives in Greenwich Village with a single mom who is a semifamous painter, Mia still puts on her Doc Martens one at a time, and the most exciting things she ever dreams about are smacking lips with sexy senior Josh Richter, "six feet of unadulterated hotness," and passing Algebra I. Then Mia's dad comes to town, and drops a major bomb. Turns out he's not just a European politician as he's always lead her to believe, but actually the prince of a small country! And Mia, his only heir, is now considered the crown princess of Genovia! She doesn't even know how to begin to cope: "I am so NOT a princess.... You never saw anyone who looked less like a princess than I do. I mean, I have really bad hair... and... a really big mouth and no breasts and feet that look like skis." And if this news wasn't bad enough, Mia's mom has started dating her algebra teacher, the paparazzi is showing up at school, and she's in a huge fight with her best friend, Lilly.

To save his life, King Arthur must answer in three days' time a riddle: "What is it that women most desire?" In despair, he accepts an offer of the answer ("Their own way") from a loathsome-looking lady who claims as reward a knight in marriage. To the horror of the court, Gawain marries the lady to save his king's honor; but when he yields to her judgment, he further releases her from a spell and is rewarded with a beautiful wife. Troughton's Sir Gawain and the Loathly Damsel (Dutton, 1972; o.p.) follows the ballad, and the colorfully stylized pictures recall leaded stained-glass windows. Wijngaard combines the illuminator's precision with a modern miniaturist's detailed perspective; each page of text is framed with manuscript-inspired designs of lacy leaves in scarlet, blue and gold, inset with wonderful, naturalistic paintings. These are full of details for readers to discover: horses' breath pluming out in frosty air; shadowy reflections on damp cobbles; and a cameo of Arthur, foot in stirrup, sleeve being pulled off-scene by the Loathly Lady.

Tim Powers, one of the most brilliant and audacious talents in contemporary fiction, casts an eerie light on the terrible events that made the twentieth century and reveals what the Cold War was <em>really</em> about.</p>Declare<p></p><p>After a ten-year hiatus, British academic Andrew Hale is abruptly called back into the Great Game by a terse, cryptic telephone message. Born to "the trade" and recruited at the age of seven by a most secret Secret Service, Hale, in 1963, is forced to confront again the nightmare that has haunted his adult life: a lethal unfinished operation code-named Declare.</p><p>Two decades earlier, as a young double agent infiltrating the Soviet spy network in Nazi-occupied Paris, Hale first encountered the incomprehensible rhythms of an invisible world. And from that moment on nothing was ever safe and knowable again. There also, his life became eternally linked with two others' lives that would recurrently intersect his at its most dangerous junctures: his "comrade operative," the fiery and beautiful Communist agent Elena Teresa Ceniza-Bendiga, the object of Hale's undying love, and Kim Philby, the mysterious traitor to the British cause...and perhaps to all humanity. Together they form an unlikely trimuvirate with one shared destiny: Declare.</p><p>But the Great Game is greater and far more terrible than Andrew Hale ever imagined. There is another, larger war raging unseen all around him, a cataclysmic secret conflict masked by a "Cold War" of national ideologies. And it is drawing Hale, Elena, and Philby inexorably toward world-shattering consequences on a Biblical mountain in the Middle East...and to a hideous feast of broken minds, destroyed lives, and devoured souls.</p><p>The remarkable imagination of Tim Powers has wedded John le Carr� with Clive Barker to create something unlike anything previously contained between book covers. A sweeping epic adventure, a love story, a revelation, a nightmare, it is our past and our world as something other...<em>Declare!</em></p></p><p>This supernatural suspense thriller crosses several genres--espionage, geopolitics, religion, fantasy. But like the chicken crossing the road, it takes quite a while to get to the other side. En route, Tim Powers covers a lot of territory: Turkey, Armenia, the Saudi Arabian desert, Beirut, London, Paris, Berlin, and Moscow. Andrew Hale, an Oxford lecturer who first entered Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service as an 18-year-old schoolboy, is called back to finish a job that culminated in a deadly mission on Mount Ararat after the end of World War II. Now it's 1963, and cold war politics are behind the decision to activate Hale for another attempt to complete Operation Declare and bring down the Communist government before Moscow can harness the powerful, other-worldly forces concentrated on the summit of the mountain, supposed site of the landing of Noah's ark. James Theodora is the �ber-spymaster whose internecine rivalry with other branches of the Secret Intelligence Service traps Hale between a rock and a hard place, literally and figuratively. There's plenty of mountain and desert survival stuff here, a plethora of geopolitical and theological history, and a big serving of <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i>, which is Hale's guide to the meteorites, drogue stones, and <i>amonon</i> plant, which figure in this complicated tale. There's a love story, too, and a bizarre twist on the Kim Philby legend that posits both Philby and Hale as the only humans who can tame the powers of the djinns who populate Mount Ararat.<p> This is an easy book to get lost in, and Powers's many fans will have a field day with it. The rest of us may have a harder time. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><p>Tim Powers is the author of numerous novels including <em>Hide Me Among the Graves, Three Days to Never, Declare, Last Call,</em> and <em>On Stranger Tides,</em> which inspired the feature film <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.</em> He has won the Philip K.

T. Barnum, Walt Whitman, Frederick Douglass, and L. C. Q. Lamar, <em>Ecstatic Nation</em> brilliantly balances cultural and political history: It's a riveting account of the sectional conflict that preceded the Civil War, and it astutely chronicles the complex aftermath of that war and Reconstruction, including the promise that women would share in a new&nbsp;definition of American citizenship. It takes us from photographic surveys of the Sierra Nevadas to the discovery of gold in the South Dakota hills, and it signals the painful, thrilling birth of modern America.</p><p>An epic tale by award-winning author Brenda Wineapple, <em>Ecstatic Nation</em> lyrically and with true originality captures the optimism, the failures, and the tragic exuberance of a renewed Republic.</p></p><p><p>For America, the mid-nineteenth century was an era of vast expectation and expansion: the country dreamed big, craved new lands, developed new technologies, and after too long a delay, finally confronted its greatest moral failure: slavery. Award-winning historian and literary critic Brenda Wineapple explores these feverish, ecstatic, conflicted years when Americans began to live within new and ever-widening borders, both spiritual and geographic; fought a devastating war over parallel ideals of freedom and justice; and transformed their country, at tragic cost, from a confederation into one nation, indivisible.</p><p>Populated by idiosyncratic, unforgettable characters such as P. T. Barnum, Walt Whitman, George Armstrong Custer, Horace Greeley, and Jefferson Davis, <em>Ecstatic Nation</em> moves from the vehement debates about slavery through the devastations of the Civil War and its aftermath. It explores the terrible complexities of Reconstruction and the fledgling hope that women would share equally in a new definition of American citizenship, and it traces the lust for land and the lure of its beauty from a frenzied rush to riches to the displacement of Indians. And it looks forward&#x2014;toward the promise of a more perfect Union for all.</p><p>A masterful synthesis of political, cultural, and intellectual history, breathtaking in sweep and scope, <em>Ecstatic Nation</em> is a spellbinding tale of America&#x2014;its glory and greed, its aspirations and humiliations&#x2014;in this exhilarating and momentous period.</p><p>Brenda Wineapple is the prizewinning author of several books, including <em>White Heat: The Friendship of Emily Dickinson and Thomas Wentworth Higginson</em>, which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book.

Here is the complete and true account of their family lives, childhoods, teenage years and their infatuation with American music, here is the riveting narrative of their unforgettable days and nights in the Cavern Club, their laughs, larks and adventures when they could move about freely, before fame closed in. &nbsp;<br><br>For those who&#x2019;ve never read a Beatles book before, this is the place to discover the young men behind the icons. For those who think they know John, Paul, George, and Ringo, it&#x2019;s time to press the Reset button and tune into the real story, the lasting word.</p></p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Mark Lewisohn</b></p> <p><strong>Q. So much has been written about the Beatles, why is this book different to all other books?</strong></p> <p>A. 'We know everything there is to know about the Beatles, so what else can possibly be written?' People say that all the time &#x2013; and I don't agree with it for a second. I wouldn't argue the Beatles' story has been told often, but I <em>would</em> argue that it can't be told again and differently. It's been related the same old way for so very long and it's also dying under the suffocating blanket of 'celebrity'. I want to start again, I want to press the Refresh button.</p> <p>This is a comprehensive biography, three volumes, a sequential history in which I set out to relate everything that happened, and do so with integrity, attention to detail, accuracy and, I believe, a fair understanding of where the story needs to be told and how to tell it. I'm writing so it unfolds as if in real time &#x2013; there's no hindsight cleverness, so you get a vivid sense of the forward movement. The Beatles' story always had tremendous energy, speed, vitality &#x2013; and this must be tangible to the reader.</p> <p>It all boils down to this. They were four war babies from Liverpool who really did change the world, and whose music and impact still lives on in so many ways, after all these years. I say, let's scrub what we know, or think we know, and start over: <em>Who really were these people, and how did it all happen? </em></p> <p><strong>Q. What period of the story does <em>Tune In</em> cover?</strong></p> <p>A. It ends on 31 December 1962, with the Beatles on the cusp of their phenomenal breakthrough, but with everything having fallen well into place &#x2013; all the people, places, personalities, situations, organisation. So I'm writing about the Liverpool and Hamburg years, the formative years, the teenage years and the childhood years, and all the family backgrounds in a <em>Who Do They Think They Are?</em>-style history &#x2013; and these families were almost as fascinating as their famous offspring. The three volumes aren't only about 'who these people were' but 'what made them what they were?' I begin this history in 1845; there's a fair deal of Irish blood in the Beatles and I start with the potato famine, which forces the Lennons into Liverpool. Then it moves swiftish through the next hundred years and becomes very solid from the Second World War and the arrival of all the main players.</p> <p>I'm sure it won't surprise anyone to learn that the Beatles didn't suddenly grow personalities when they had a hit record &#x2013; that their talent, originality and relentless desire to move on fast, to try new things, was already well in place in their early years. I'm sure no one would be amazed to find the Beatles didn't become instantly remarkable when they conquered Britain, America and much of the world, or funny when they filmed <em>A Hard Day's Night</em>, or inventive when recording <em>Revolver</em> or <em>Sgt Pepper</em>. It was always who they were, a continuation of what was going in all these earlier years, except more visible. The richness of the stories to come in books two and three is also in volume one all the way through. Really, everything was revved up and running in these formative years, in the halls, houses and streets of Liverpool, the only place these people and those events could have happened.</p> <p><strong>Q. You have a long professional association with the Beatles, and some of them individually. Are they involved in <em>Tune In</em> and is this book authorized?</strong></p> <p>A. No. I received the odd tiny bit of help which I specifically asked for and they didn't have to give &#x2013; but substantially no, they're not involved. That's fine, because it's what I expected and what I wanted. This has to be an independent and impartial book. But are the all main players appearing and speaking at the book's core? Yes, constantly. Paul McCartney decided not to talk to me for this particular project, and I completely respect and understand his reasons &#x2013; but I've interviewed him maybe fifteen times in the past and I've also sourced other quotes of great strength and immediacy for all the players.</p> <p>One of many reasons the Beatles' achievements and reputation sustain with such integrity is because they were true. They stood for truth, projected truth and lived truthfully as best they could. It's entirely right that their history is written as true as possible, with no embroidery, nothing faked or glossed, nothing stupidly interpreted, everything transparent, everything attributed. Of course my attachment to this subject is deep and lifelong, but I'm not the least bit interested in writing a book simply to say how great they were. They certainly don't need that, and I certainly wouldn't do it. It'd be a waste of my time. My passion is for learning everything I can about this subject, understanding it, and doing my best to set it down clearly so it can be understood relative to what happened.</p>MARK LEWISOHN is the acknowledged world authority on the Beatles.

As those extraordinary years unfolded, the Surrealists found ever more innovative ways of exploring the interior life, and asking new questions about how to define art.&nbsp;<i>In Montparnasse</i>&nbsp;recounts how this artistic revolution came to be amidst the salons and caf�s of that vibrant neighborhood.<br><br> Sue Roe is both an incisive art critic of these pieces and a beguiling biographer with a fingertip feel for this compelling world. Beginning with Duchamp, Roe then takes us through the rise of the Dada movement, the birth of Surrealist photography with Man Ray, the creation of key works by Ernst, Cocteau, and others, through the arrival of Dal�. On canvas and in their readymades and other works these artists juxtaposed objects never before seen together to make the viewer marvel at the ordinary&#x2014;and at the workings of the subconscious. We see both how this art came to be and how the artists of Montparnasse lived. Roe puts us with Gertrude Stein in her box seat at the opening of&nbsp;<i>The Rite of Spring</i>; with Duchamp as he installs his famous urinal; at a Cocteau theatrical with Picasso and Coco Chanel; with Breton at a session with Freud; and with Man Ray as he romances Kiki de Montparnasse.&nbsp;<br><br> Stein said it best when she noted that the Surrealists still saw in the common ways of the 19th century, but they complicated things with the bold new vision of the 20th. Their words mark an enormously important watershed in the history of art&#x2014;and they forever changed the way we all see the world.</p><p><b>Sue Roe</b> is the author of several books, including <i>In Montmartre: Picasso, Matisse and the Birth of Modernist Art</i> and a collective biography of the Impressionists.

Karen Hancock brings to imaginative life the supernatural battle between good and evil, the preconceptions that keep us from embracing truth, and the distortions that trick and trap us. Four years have passed since the conclusion of The Light of Eidon. Abramm has been living peacefully abroad, but when he hears of trouble in his homeland, he returns to claim the crown he thought he'd never wear. But he has many enemies, including his murderous brother. The only thing that will save him is the Light that lives within him, but to appease his critics, he hides this. Before he can fulfill his kingship, he must reveal the truth and be reminded, painfully and powerfully, that his destiny can only be realized through humbly acknowledging his own weakness and the utter sufficiency of the One who created his destiny in the first place.</p><p>Karen Hancock is a graduate of the University of Arizona with bachelor&#39;s degrees in Biology and Wildlife Biology. Her first novel, Arena, won the Christy Award for Excellence in Christian Fiction. Along with writing, she is a watercolorist. She resides with her husband and son in Arizona.Hancock's <i>The Shadow Within</i> is the second entry in her Legends of the Guardian King series, following <i>The Light of Eidon</i>. The series is a heavily plotted medieval epic distinguished, as is all of Hancock's work, by intricate world building. The story opens with the epic slaying of a sea monster that is part <i>Beowulf</i>, part <i>Moby Dick</i>, but mostly <i>Star Trek</i>, since despite all the gore, there's little sense of menace. Nonetheless, young Abramm's heroism in killing the monster shows that God--or Eidon--is on his side and enables him to return to his home kingdom to claim the crown. His authority is unimpeachable, but plots abound; in fact, the bulk of the novel deals with the slithering intrigues that Hancock first showed a knack for in <i>Arena</i> (2002). <i>John Mort</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Newly acquired Orestes Minoso, the first black to play Major League Baseball in the City of Chicago, stepped into the batter&#39;s box for his first turn at bat in a Chicago White Sox uniform. Minnie tells of his boyhood days in the sugar fields of Cuba, racial discrimination in Cuban society, and feelings of betrayal upon being traded from the Cleveland Indians to the Chicago White Sox in 1951.</p><p>Fagen is one of the nation&#39;s leading experts on the subject of the Hollywood Western.One of Minoso's claims to fame is having played professional baseball for six decades until 1993, a record; another is having been one of the pioneer Latin American players--especially beloved among black Latinos--in U.S. ball. He has spent most of his career with the Chicago White Sox as player, coach and currently roving goodwill ambassador, but he also served in the pre-integration Negro Leagues with the Cleveland Indians and, when his major league years ended, in Mexico. As a strongly anti-communist Cuban, he severed his ties with his native land in 1961 after his property there was expropriated, but he helped many members of his family emigrate to America. Assisted by Fagen ( The Lost Loves of Autumn ) he gives readers an appealing portrait of a good man with a strong work ethic and deep sense of loyalty. Whether his book will sell well outside Chicagoland is questionable, though.

QPB &amp; One Spirit Alt.</p><p>Angels, prophetic dreams, and resurrection -- as we approach the millennium, American culture is increasingly fascinated with what many consider to be "new age" phenomena. Yet our current millennial preoccupations are derived from the ancient Hebraic, Christian, and Sufi traditions; they are neither ephemeral nor trivial. They have inspired and captivated the greatest of Western thinkers, from antiquity to Milton, Blake and Shakespeare. <p> What are the angels? And where does our notion of them originate? What role have dreams played in the history of human consciousness? What is the link between angels, prophetic dreams, and near-death experiences? How are these phenomena relevant to us today, as we approach the 21st century? </p><p> In this commanding and impassioned inquiry, Harold Bloom draws on a life-long study of religion and, in particular, of <i>Gnosticism</i>, the knowledge that God is not an external force but resides within each one of us. Through the ancient literature of Jewish Kabbalah, Christian Gnosticism, and Muslim Shi`ite Sufism, he reveals to us the angels not as the kitschy cherubs we know today, but as magnificent, terrifying, sublime beings who have always played a central role in Western culture. He allows us to feel their splendor, and to experience the powerful role that dreams and near-death experiences have held throughout the centuries. And in the dazzling final chapter, he delivers a Gnostic sermon in which he urges us toward transcendence. </p><p> In <b>Omens of Millennium</b>, Harold Bloom has written a book whose triumph is not only its synthesis of centuries of religious thought, but its deep spirituality, through which we come to know - and to mourn - a religious experience no longer available to us. A brilliant and provocative book, sure to engender as much discussion as his books The Western Canon and The Book of J.</p>Harold Bloom is Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University and Berg Professor of English at New York University.</p><h2>Annabel Langbein The Free Range Cook</h2><p>Annabel Langbein is on a mission to get people into the kitchen with fun, no-stress recipes.

She married Buster Keaton in 1940. <p>JEFFREY VANCE is co-author, with Lita Grey Chaplin, of Wife of the Life of the Party, a work on Charlie Chaplin. A film archivist and authority on silent comedy, he has lectured extensively on screen legends Chaplin and Keaton and has been involved in the restoration of Keaton&#x2019;s classics. </p><p>KEVIN BROWNLOW is a well-known expert on silent films and the author of Abrams&#x2019; Mary Pickford Rediscovered.</p>As it did with 1999's Mary Pickford Rediscovered (LJ 9/15/99), the publisher raids the archives of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to present a lavish photographic tribute, in this case to silent film comedian Buster Keaton (1895-1966). Comprising formal and behind-the-scenes stills, staged publicity shots, and previously unpublished personal photos, this book is the most comprehensive pictorial retrospective on Keaton to date. In contrast to the Pickford book, however, the quality of the text and illustrations is not entirely balanced. Whereas in the former publication, Kevin Brownlow provided a thorough retrospective from both historical and critical standpoints, here he contributes only the afterword. As a result, the book doesn't delve into Keaton's technical prowess as an innovator of films whose complex sight gags, integrated narratives, and overall visual style transcended slapstick comedy so much as it celebrates his achievements as a performer. But while the biographical material and film synopses are less scintillating than the photographs, they do not detract from this gorgeous testament to a legend and to the often overlooked achievements of film curators and preservationists.

Cookie jars held pennies, not Christmas cookies.So when Jack smells something delicious coming from the kitchen, he can&#x2019;t believe his nose. Cookies!But his excitement turns to disappointment when he learns the cookies aren&#x2019;t for him. Instead, Mother is baking them for the needy people at their church. While Jack helps roll out the dough, his mother tells him the legend of the Christmas cookie.In a captivating interplay of simple words and beautiful illustrations, The Legend of the Christmas Cookie tells a tender story of giving&#x2015;not just cookies, but gifts of the heart that last forever.</p><p><p>Dandi Daley Mackall loves God, children, words, and animals.

Dandi writes from rural Ohio, where she lives with her family, including horses, dogs, cats, and an occasional squirrel, deer, or raccoon.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>Kindergarten-Grade 2&#x2013;It's the Depression, and Jack's father in away from the family, in search of work. On Christmas Eve, a wonderful aroma momentarily lifts Jack's spirits until he finds out that the cookies baking in the oven are for the needy. To ease his disappointment, Jack's mother tells him about the origin of Christmas cookies. During the Middle Ages, a woodcarver and his wife made cookie molds to help them tell the story of the Nativity. Jack's mother surprises him with an angel cookie on Christmas morning and, in the spirit of the story he's been told, he gives it to a destitute stranger who comes to the door begging for food. While at times the prose is too precise in pointing out the parallels between the two eras (e.g., Jack...wondered if times in the Middle Ages had been harder than they were right now, and if boys missed their fathers like he missed his) and the appearance of the poor stranger at the door is contrived, the overall lesson of giving prevails. The atmospheric illustrations depict Jack's kitchen as spare but welcoming. The mouthwatering cookies look as if they can satisfy both physical and spiritual hunger. Refreshingly stripped of holiday commercialism, this is an appropriate title for those who wish to introduce a new perspective to the Christmas story.<i>&#x2013;Joanna K.

It is concerned with the simple joys, the timelessness and perspective found in a way of life which is close to the past. I have heard the singing in many places, but I seem to hear it best in the wilderness lake country of the Quetico-Superior, where travel is still by pack and canoe over the ancient trails of the Indians and voyageurs." Thus the author sets the theme and tone of this enthralling book of discovery about one of the few great primitive areas in our country which have withstood the pressures of civilization.<br><br>Acute natural perceptivity and a profound knowledge of the relationships to be found in nature combine here in vivid evocations of the sights, the sounds, the vast stillnesses, and the events of the wilderness as the seasons succeed each other. But Mr. Olson is not content merely to "describe; he probes for meanings that will lead the reader to a different and more revealing way of looking at the out-of-doors and to a deeper sense of its eternal values. In each of the thirty-four chapters of The Singing Wilderness he has sought to capture an essential quality of our magnificent lake and forest heritage. He shows us what can be read from the rocks of the great Canadian Shield; he offers a delightful essay on the virtues of pine knots as fuel; he writes of the ways of a canoe, of flashing trout in the pools of the Isabella, of tamarack bogs, caribou moss, the flight of wild geese, timber wolves, and the birds of the ski trails. And much more, with something to satisfy every taste for wilderness experience.<br><br>Superbly illustrated with 38 black-and-white drawings by Francis Lee Jaques, The Singing Wilderness is a book that no lover of nature will want to be without. To anyone who contemplates a vacation in the lake country of northern Minnesota and adjoining Canada, it is the perfect vade mecum.</p><p>As meaningful today as it was when Sigurd F. Olson wrote it, The Singing Wilderness is an essential antidote to the trials of modern life. This unique volume, beautifully illustrated by Francis Lee Jaques, will be a welcome addition to any nature lover&#39;s bookshelf or backpack.Sigurd F. Olson was for more than thirty years a wilderness guide in the Quetico-Superior country, and no one knew with the same intimacy the mysteries of the lakes and forests of that magnificent primitive area. To the many out-of-doorsmen who canoed and portaged with him through this wilderness, he was known honorifically as the Bourgeois -- as the voyageurs of old called their trusted leaders through this same region.<br><br>Mr. Olson was born in Chicago in 1899, and educated at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Illinois. For several years he taught biology at Ely Junior College and later served as Dean. He was President of the National Parks Association, a member of its Board of Trustees, and was for years active in organizations devoted to conservation problems.<br><br>Mr. Olson was a frequent contributor to magazines concerned with the outdoors, and is the author of several books including Listening Point, The Lonely Land, Runes of the North, Reflection from the North Country, and Of Time and Place. Until his death in 1982, he made his home with his wife, Elizabeth, in Ely, Minnesota, gateway to his beloved Quetico-Superior country.</p><h2>The Father Hunt</h2><p>Hired to locate Amy Denovo&#39;s long-lost father, Nero Wolfe and his assistant, Archie Goodwin, discover that the missing man has a deadly and dangerous secret to hide. Reissue.</p><p><b>Rex Stout</b> (1886&#x2013;1975) wrote dozens of short stories, novellas, and full-length mystery novels, most featuring his two indelible characters, the peerless detective Nero Wolfe and his handy sidekick, Archie Goodwin.The rotund, acerbic grower of rare orchids, Nero Wolfe, and his sidekick, Archie Goodwin, are private investigators who are very good at what they do (and who set their fees accordingly). Here they take on the case of a beautiful young lady searching for the father she never knew. Michael Prichard's masterful reading strikes just the right note as he showcases Wolfe's discriminating tastes and basic goodness and captures Archie's New York cockiness and deep sense of decency. It's a tribute to both Stout and Prichard that this audiobook is still fresh today.

It has created unforgettable tea parties for famous clients including Paul Smith CBE, Myleene Klass, and Kim Jones to name but a few! Angel was the outstanding character on BBC Two&#39;s series &#39;Dragons&#39; Den&#39;. She has grown up with great determination, a skill for creativity and has taught herself strong business acumen - she ticked all the boxes with the dragons and became the face of the series. Angel&#39;s eye for beautiful things started at a young age, and by the age of thirteen she was buying vintage clothes and gems. A market stall followed and when the stall couldn&#39;t quell the tide of treasure, Angel moved to a big converted school house in Bethnal Green. It was here in 2001 that the launch of &#39;The Vintage Experience&#39; took place, where Angel opened her doors to her devotees and revealed rail upon rail of vintage delights, and offered advice and hand-picked gems that were just right for her clients - as well as providing them with delicious cakes! The Vintage Experience lasted for seven years and when this brand could grow no more, the Vintage Patisserie was born! Angel&#39;s business has grown from strength to strength and this year saw the opening for her new East London event space, Vintage Hair Academy and Vintage Hospitality school.

The room&#x2019;s far wall was almost entirely of glass, so that the view was nearly agoraphobic. They&#x2019;re predicting that if the big one&#x2014;the big earthquake that is&#x2014;hits, this section of L. A. will be eight to fifteen feet deep in glass. Anything on the streets below will be cut to pieces, crushed, or trapped underneath an avalanche of glass. Not a pretty thought, but it was a day for ugly thoughts.<br><br>My uncle Taranis, King of Light and Illusion, had pressed charges against three of my royal bodyguards. He had gone to the human authorities with charges that Rhys, Galen, and Abe had raped one of his court&#x2019;s women.<br><br>In all the long history of his reign in the Seelie Court he had never gone outside to the humans for justice. Faerie rule; faerie law. Or truthfully, sidhe rule; sidhe law. The sidhe had ruled faerie for longer than anyone could remember. Since some of those memories stretched back thousands of years, maybe the sidhe had always been in charge, but it tasted like a lie. The sidhe do not lie, for to truly lie is to be cast out of faerie, exiled. Since I knew that the three bodyguards in question were innocent, that raised interesting problems with Lady Caitrin&#x2019;s testimony.<br><br>But today we were just giving statements, and, depending on how that went, King Taranis was standing by for a group call. Which was why Simon Biggs and Thomas Farmer, both of Biggs, Biggs, Farmer, and Farmer, were sitting beside me.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you for agreeing to this meeting today, Princess Meredith,&#x201d; one of the suits across the table said. There were seven suits across the wide, gleaming table, with their backs to the lovely view.<br><br>Ambassador Stevens, official ambassador to the courts of faerie, was sitting on our side of the table, but he was on the far side of Biggs and Farmer. Stevens said, &#x201c;A word on faerie etiquette: You don&#x2019;t say thank you to the people of faerie, Mr. Shelby. Princess Meredith, as one of the younger royals, will probably not be offended, but you will be dealing with some nobility who are much older. Not all of them will allow a thank you to pass without grave insult.&#x201d; Stevens smiled when he said it, his blandly handsome face sincere from his brown eyes to his perfectly cut brown hair. He was supposed to be our voice to the world, but, truthfully, he spent all his time at the Seelie Court sucking up to my uncle. The Unseelie Court where my aunt Andais, Queen of Air and Darkness, ruled, and where I might rule someday, was too scary for Stevens. No, I didn&#x2019;t like him.<br><br>Michael Shelby, a U. S. Attorney for L. A. said, &#x201c;I am sorry, Princess Meredith. I didn&#x2019;t realize.&#x201d;<br><br>I smiled, and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine. The ambassador is correct, a thank-you won&#x2019;t bother me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it will bother your men?&#x201d; Shelby asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Some of them, yes,&#x201d; I said. I looked behind me to Doyle and Frost. They stood behind me like darkness and snow made real, and that wasn&#x2019;t far from the truth. Doyle had black hair, black skin, a black designer suit; even his tie was black. Only the shirt was a rich royal blue, and that had been a sop to our lawyer. He thought black gave the wrong impression, made him seem threatening. Doyle, whose nickname was Darkness, had said, &#x201c;I am the captain of the princess&#x2019; guard. I am supposed to be threatening.&#x201d; The lawyers hadn&#x2019;t known what to say to that, but Doyle had worn the blue shirt. The color almost glowed against the rich, perfect black of his skin, which was so black there were purple and blue highlights to his body in the right light. His black eyes were hidden behind wraparound black-on-black sunglasses.<br><br>Frost&#x2019;s skin was as white as Doyle&#x2019;s was black. As white as my own. But his hair was uniquely his own, silver, like metal beaten into hair. It gleamed in the tasteful lighting of the conference room. Gleamed like something you could have melted down and made into jewelry. He had tied the top layer of it back with a barrette that was silver, and older than the city of Los Angeles itself. The dove-gray suit was Ferragamo, and the white of his shirt was less white than his own skin. The tie was darker than the suit, but not by much. The soft gray of his eyes was bare to the room as he scanned the far windows. Doyle was doing it, too, behind his glasses. I had bodyguards for a reason, and some who wanted me dead could fly. We didn&#x2019;t think Taranis was one of the people who wanted me dead, but why had he gone to the police? Why had he persisted in these false charges? He would never have done all this without an agenda. We just didn&#x2019;t know what that agenda was, so just in case, they watched the windows for things that the human lawyers couldn&#x2019;t even begin to imagine.<br><br>Shelby&#x2019;s gaze flicked behind me to the guards. He wasn&#x2019;t the only one who kept fighting not to glance nervously at my men, but it was Assistant District Attorney Pamela Nelson who was having the most trouble keeping her eyes, and her mind, on business. The men across the table gave the guards the glances men give when they see another man whom they are almost certain could take them physically without breaking a sweat.<br><br>U. S. Attorney Michael Shelby was tall, athletic, and handsome, with a gleam of white teeth, and the look of someone who had plans to rise above being the U. S. attorney for the Los Angeles area. He was over six feet, and his suit couldn&#x2019;t hide the fact that he worked out pretty seriously. He probably didn&#x2019;t meet many men who made him feel physically weak. His assistant Ernesto Bertram was a slender man who looked too young for his job, and far too serious with his short dark hair and glasses. It wasn&#x2019;t the glasses that made him look too serious; it was the look on his face, as if he&#x2019;d tasted something sour. The U. S. attorney for the St. Louis area, Albert Veducci, was here, too. He didn&#x2019;t have Shelby&#x2019;s tan. In fact, he was a little overweight, and he looked tired. His assistant was Grover. He&#x2019;d actually introduced himself only as Grover, so I didn&#x2019;t know if it was his first, last, or only name. He smiled more than the rest of them and was attractive in that friendly, walk-you-home-on-campus way. He reminded me of guys in college who were either as nice as they seemed or absolute bastards who only wanted sex, for you to help them pass a class, or, for me, to be close to a real live faerie princess. I wouldn&#x2019;t know which kind of &#x201c;nice guy&#x201d; Grover was for a while. If things went well, I&#x2019;d never figure it out, because I&#x2019;d probably never see him again. If they went badly, we might see a lot of Grover.<br><br>Nelson was the assistant district attorney to the district attorney for Los Angeles County. Her boss, Miguel Cortez, was short, dark, and handsome. He looked great on camera. I&#x2019;d seen him on the news often enough here. The trouble was that he, like Shelby, was ambitious. He liked being on the news, and wanted to be on the news more. This accusation of rape against my men had all the earmarks of a case that could make your career or break it. Cortez and Shelby were ambitious; it meant that they would either be very cautious, or very incautious. I wasn&#x2019;t sure which mood would help us the most, yet.<br><br>Nelson was taller than her boss, close to six feet in her not-too-high heels. Her hair was a vibrant red that fell in waves around her shoulders. It was that rare shade that is deep, rich, and as close to true red as human hair can get. Her suit was well cut, but conservative and black, her button-up shirt white, her makeup tasteful. Only that flame of hair to ruin the almost mannish exterior she portrayed. It was as if she were hiding her beauty and drawing attention to it at the same time. Because she was beautiful. A sprinkling of freckles underneath the pale makeup didn&#x2019;t detract from the flawless skin, it added. Her eyes were green and blue at once, depending on how the light caught them. Those undecided eyes couldn&#x2019;t stop looking at Frost and Doyle. She tried to concentrate on the legal pad she was supposed to be making notes on, but her gaze kept rising, and finding them, as if she couldn&#x2019;t help herself.<br><br>That made me wonder if there was more going on than just handsome men and a distracted woman.<br><br>Shelby cleared his throat sharply.<br><br>I jumped and looked at him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m terribly sorry, Mr. Shelby, were you speaking to me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I was not, and I should have been.&#x201d; He looked down the table on his side. &#x201c;I was brought into this as a more neutral voice, but let me ask my fellow members of the bar if they are having trouble forming questions for the princess.&#x201d;<br><br>Several of the lawyers spoke at the same time. Veducci just raised his pencil in the air. Veducci got the nod. &#x201c;My office has dealt more closely with the princess and her people than the rest of you, which is why I&#x2019;m carrying certain remedies against glamour.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What sort of remedies?&#x201d; Shelby asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t tell you what I&#x2019;m carrying, but cold steel, iron, four-leaf clover, St.-John&#x2019;s-Wort, rowan and ash&#x2014;either the wood or the berries&#x2014;have been known to work. Some say bells will break glamour, but I think high-court sidhe won&#x2019;t be bothered much by bells.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you saying that the princess is using glamour against us?&#x201d; Shelby asked, his handsome face no longer pleasant.<br><br>&#x201c;I am saying that sometimes when dealing with King Taranis or Queen Andais, their presence overwhelms humans,&#x201d; Veducci responded. &#x201c;Princess Meredith, being part human, though beautiful&#x2014;&#x201d; He nodded in my direction.<br><br>I nodded at the compliment.<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2014;has never affected anyone so strongly, but a lot ha...</p><h2>The Doom of the Haunted Opera</h2><p>Lewis Barnavelt and Rose Rita Pottinger are faced with a dilemma when their discovery of an unpublished opera score unleashes a wicked sorcerer who plans to rule the world by bringing back the dead</p><p><b>John Anthony Bellairs</b>&nbsp;(1938 1991) is an award-winning American author, perhaps best known for his&nbsp;fantasy&nbsp;novel&nbsp;The Face in the Frost.&nbsp;He is also the author of many&nbsp;gothic&nbsp;mystery&nbsp;novels for children and young adults, including The House with a Clock in its Walls (which received both the New York Times Outstanding Book of Award and the American Library Association Children's Books of International Interest Award), The Lamp from the Warlock&#x2019;s Tomb (which won the Edgar Allen Poe Award), and The Specter from the Magician&#x2019;s Museum (which won the New York Public Library "Best Books for the Teen Age" Award.<br> &nbsp;<br>Grade 5-8?A delightful, spooky mystery starring Lewis Barnavelt and Rose Rita Pottinger, heroes of several earlier novels. A school assignment leads these 1950s teens to an abandoned theater in the heart of their hometown, New Zebedee, where Lewis finds sheet music inside an old piano?and a ghost, who warns him, "Beware the doom of the haunted opera!" The whole town gets involved in staging the opera, and a stranger shows up to watch the action. Henry Vanderhelm claims to be the composer's grandson, but when New Zebedee is suddenly cut off from the outside world, a horrid suspicion dawns on Lewis. Vanderhelm is the composer himself?and the opera is really an elaborate spell designed to make him King of the Dead and enable him to take over the world. Lewis and Rose Rita are bright and likable protagonists. Other characters are equally well drawn, especially the evil Vanderhelm and the mistake-prone would-be magician, Mrs. Jaeger, a neighbor who helps the young people. The action moves quickly; tension escalates nicely, and Lewis gets a boost of confidence from a surprising source when things look bleakest. A great addition to the mystery shelf.?Mary Jo Drungil, Niles Public Library District, IL<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>On Writing Well: The Classic Guide To Writing Nonfiction: 30th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>On Writing Well has been praised for its sound advice, its clarity and the warmth of its style.

The cuisine that developed in their households is a remarkable melange of kosher traditions and the distinctive flavors of Italy, the Middle East, and Spain. For the first time, this wonderfully rich, little-known culinary heritage is given the attention it has long deserved. With <i>Cucina Ebraica</i>, celebrated chef Joyce Goldstein offers a substantive collection of superb (and completely kosher) Italian Jewish dishes, as well as a compelling and important culinary history. Exploring the ancient intertwining of two venerable food traditions, we discover that many Italian dishes have Jewish roots. Familiar and yet entirely new, this is a robust and delicious new side of a beloved region's cuisine. Filled with painterly photographs that evoke the richness of the Italian Jewish heritage, <i>Cucina Ebraica</i> is a mouthwatering collection of distinguished recipes, a reference on an extraordinary tradition, and an invitation to unexpected joys and secrets about both Italian and Jewish cookery.</p><p>Jews have lived in Italy since Roman times, always part of the cultural landscape, always living in isolation of one kind or another. The word we know as <i>ghetto</i> comes to us from 16th-century Venice. Within the world of Jews in Italy, there are several smaller worlds: those of the native Italian Jews, of the Sephardim driven out of Spain, and of the Ashkenazim moving down from Germany and Eastern Europe. Take all those food traditions and dietary laws, squeeze them in one overarching food sensibility, and you have a very unusual way to view culture and history. Joyce Goldstein, in <i>Cucina Ebraica</i>, demonstrates that culture and history are edible, if not downright delicious.<p> Take Livornese Couscous with Meatballs, White Beans, and Greens. Couscous came to Livorno with North African Jews in the 1270s. It was a Friday-night meal, and the leftovers were served cold the next day on the Sabbath. Goldstein gives the first honest recipe for Carciofi alla Giudia (crispy fried artichokes in the Roman Jewish style) yet printed. Not all artichokes are alike, she demonstrates, and then shows you a way around the problems no one else ever manages to address to successfully cook this classic. </p><p> As she has proved in <i>The Mediterranean Kitchen</i> and <i>Kitchen Conversations</i>, Joyce Goldstein knows how to bring great food to the home kitchen. Her research is impeccable, her technique straightforward. <i>Cucina Ebraica</i>, this wonderful way of looking at an Italian cuisine that must answer to so many other influences, is an obvious project of love and devotion. Not to be missed. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Joyce Goldstein, chef, author, and teacher, is an acknowledged expert on both Jewish and Mediterranean cooking, as revealed in such books as Enoteca (0-8118-2825-5) and her unprecedented exploration of Jewish cuisine from the diaspora begun in Cucina Ebrai<br><br>Ellen Silverman is a well-known food and still-life photgrapher based in New York City.</p><h2>The Whole-Food Guide to Strong Bones: A Holistic Approach (The New Harbinger Whole-Body Healing Series)</h2><p><p>It's essential to maintain strong bones to keep an active lifestyle, but aside from taking a daily calcium supplement, is there really anything you can do to improve your bone health?

Even though some stores initially shelved the book under Cooking and the New York Daily News wrote a full-page article about the book on its food page, its obvious that people are now using the book not just in the kitchen but in other rooms of the house or the office. This was one of the first books connecting Buddhism to social action and, as such, it set a remarkable example." <br>--Toinette Lippe, editorial director of Bell TowerRick Fields (1942&#x2013;1999) is the author of several books, including <i>Chop Wood</i>,<i> Carry Water </i> and <i>The Code of the Warrior. </i> He has served as the editor of <i>The Vajradhatu Sun, </i> an international journal of Buddhism (now <i>Shambhala Sun</i>), and as the editor-at-large of <i>Tricycle: A Buddhist Review. </i></p><h2>Incest: From a Journal of Love : The Unexpurgated Diary of Anias Nin, 1932-1934</h2><p>The author&#39;s diary includes details of her relationships with Henry Miller and his wife, June, Antonin Artaud, Rene Allendy, Otto Rank and her father</p><p>Ana-s Nin (1903-1977) was born in Paris and aspired at an early age to be a writer. An influential artist and thinker, she was the author of several novels, short stories, critical studies, a collection of essays, two volumes of erotica, and nine published volumes of her Diary.Picking up where Henry and June (1986) left off, this portion of Nin's diary, which was cut from the expurgated editions published in her lifetime, records her steamy love affair with Henry Miller in Paris, but here her intense adoration gives way to disillusionment. She describes Miller as crude, egotistic, imitative, childishly irresponsible, "a madman." Her real focus, however, is her father, Joaquin Nin, a Spanish pianist and aristocratic Don Juan who seduced her after a 20-year absence. Her graphic account of their lovemaking and of her incestuous romantic feelings is fairly shocking. Nin sought absolution from her psychiatrist and lover, Otto Rank, who advised her to bed her father, then dump him as punishment for abandoning her when she was 10. Nin's ornate, hothouse prose is much rawer than the chiseled style of the expurgated diaries. She seethes with jealousy at Miller's wife June, swoons over poet and actor Antonin Artaud, neglects her protective husband, Hugh Guiler, and describes her traumatic delivery of a stillborn child. Her extraordinary, tangled self-analysis is a disarming record of her emotional and creative growth.

This is her first novel.***This excerpt is from an advance uncorrected proof***<br><br>Copyright � 2014 Laura Lane McNeal <br><br><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><br>There are times you wish you could change things, take things back, pretend they never existed. This was one of those times, Ibby Bell was thinking as she stared bug-eyed out the car window. Amid the double-galleried homes and brightly painted cottages on Prytania Street, there was one house that didn&#x2019;t belong.</p><p>&#x201c;Ibby?&#x201d; Her mother turned down the radio and began drumming her fingers on the steering wheel.</p><p>Ibby ignored her, letting her mother&#x2019;s words mingle with the buzz of the air conditioning and the drone of the idling car engine as she craned her neck, trying to get a better look at the house that was stubbornly obscured by the sprawling branches of a giant oak tree and the glare of the midmorning sun. She cupped her hands over her eyes and glanced up to find a weathervane shaped like a racehorse jutting high above the tallest branches of the tree. It was flapping to and fro in the tepid air, unable to quite make the total spin around the rusted stake, giving the poor horse the appearance of being tethered there against its will.</p><p>I know that feeling, Ibby thought.</p><p>The weathervane was perched atop a long spire attached to a cupola. Ibby&#x2019;s eyes traveled to the second-floor balcony, then down to the front porch, where a pair of rocking chairs and a porch swing swayed gently beside mahogany doors inlaid with glass. Surrounded on all sides by a low iron fence, the house looked like an animal that had outgrown its cage.</p><p>Her mother had described it as a Queen Anne Victorian monstrosity that should have been bulldozed years ago. Ibby now understood what she meant. The old mansion was suffering from years of neglect. A thick layer of dirt muddied the blue paint, windows were boarded up, and the front yard was so overgrown with wild azaleas and unruly boxwoods that Ibby could barely make out the brick walkway that led up to the house.</p><p>&#x201c;Liberty, are you listening to me?&#x201d;<br>It was the way Vidrine Bell said Ibby&#x2019;s real name, the way she said Li-bar-tee with a clear Southern drawl that she usually went to great lengths to hide, that got her attention.</p><p>Vidrine&#x2019;s face was glistening with sweat despite the air conditioning tousling her well-lacquered hair. She patted the side of her mouth with her finger, trying to salvage the orange lipstick that was seeping into the creases and filling the car with the smell of melted wax.</p><p>&#x201c;Damn humidity,&#x201d; Vidrine huffed. &#x201c;No one should have to live in a place hot enough to fry an egg on the sidewalk.&#x201d;</p><p>The heat, her mother claimed, was one of the reasons she and Ibby&#x2019;s father had moved away from New Orleans just after they married. Far, far away. To a little town called Olympia, in the state of Washington. Where no one had a Southern accent. Except, on occasion, the Bell family.</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever you do, Liberty Bell, don&#x2019;t forget this.&#x201d; Vidrine patted the double-handled brass urn sitting like a sentinel between them on the front seat. Her mouth curled up at the edges. &#x201c;Be sure and tell your grandmother it&#x2019;s a present from me.&#x201d;</p><p>Ibby glanced down at the urn her mother was pushing her way. A week ago that urn didn&#x2019;t exist. Now she was being told to give it to a grandmother she&#x2019;d never met. Ibby turned and looked at the house again. She didn&#x2019;t know which was worse, the sneer on her mother&#x2019;s face, or the thought of having to go into that big ugly house to meet her grandmother for the first time.</p><p>She eyed her mother, wondering why no one had bothered to mention that she even had a grandmother until a few months ago. She&#x2019;d learned about it by chance, when on a clear day in March, as her father went to pay for ice cream at the school fair, a faded photograph fell from his wallet and floated wearily to the ground. Ibby picked it up and studied the stone-faced woman in the picture for a moment before her daddy took it from her.</p><p>&#x201c;Who is that?&#x201d; Ibby asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s your grandmother,&#x201d; he said, hastily stuffing the photo back into his wallet in a way that made it clear that he didn&#x2019;t want to talk about it anymore.</p><p>Later that week, while she and Vidrine were doing the dishes, Ibby got up enough gumption to ask her mother about the woman in the photograph. Vidrine glared at her with those big round eyes that looked like cue balls and threw the dish towel to the ground, slammed her fist on the counter, then launched into a lengthy tirade that made it clear that Frances Hadley Bell, otherwise known as Fannie, was the other reason they&#x2019;d moved away from New Orleans right after she and Graham Bell were married.</p><p>And now here Ibby was, about to be dropped off at this woman&#x2019;s house without any fanfare, and her mother acting as if it were no big deal.</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you leaving me here? Can&#x2019;t I come with you?&#x201d; Ibby pleaded.</p><p>Her mother fell back against the seat, exasperated. &#x201c;Now, Ibby, we&#x2019;ve been through this a thousand times. Now that your father has passed away, I need some time away . . . to think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why won&#x2019;t you tell me where you&#x2019;re going?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s something you just don&#x2019;t need to know,&#x201d; Vidrine snapped. </p><p>&#x201c;How long will you be gone?&#x201d;</p><p>Vidrine frowned. &#x201c;A few days. Maybe a week. It&#x2019;s hard to tell. Your grandmother was kind enough to offer to keep you until I figure this whole thing out.&#x201d;</p><p>Ibby&#x2019;s ears perked up. Kind was not one of the words her mother had used to describe Fannie Bell.</p><p>In the background, she could hear the radio.</p><p>&#x201c;This is WTIX Radio New Orleans,&#x201d; the announcer said. &#x201c;Up next, The Moody Blues . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Turn that up&#x2014;that was one of Daddy&#x2019;s favorite new bands,&#x201d; Ibby said.</p><p>Vidrine turned off the radio. &#x201c;Now go on. She won&#x2019;t bite.&#x201d; She poked Ibby in the ribs, causing the brass urn to teeter and fall over on the seat.</p><p>Ibby straightened it back up, letting her fingers linger on the cool brass handle. She swallowed hard, wondering why her mother was being so secretive. Now that her father was gone, she got the feeling that what her mother really wanted was to get away from her.</p><p>Vidrine leaned over and said in a soft voice, &#x201c;Now listen, honey, I<br>know it&#x2019;s hard to understand why God takes some people from this earth before their time. But he took your daddy in a silly bicycle accident. And now . . . well, we just have to move on somehow.&#x201d;</p><p>Ibby gave her mother a sideways glance. God was a word her mother had never uttered until her father died, and being left with someone she&#x2019;d never met for an indefinite period of time wasn&#x2019;t exactly Ibby&#x2019;s idea of moving on. But she was just shy of twelve years old, and no one had bothered to ask her opinion on the matter.<br>She let her hand fall from the urn. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you at least going to come in with me?&#x201d; Ibby asked.</p><p>Vidrine crossed her arms. &#x201c;Liberty Alice Bell, quit your whining and get on out of this car right now. I&#x2019;ve got to go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But Mom&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now remember what I told you. Be a good girl. Don&#x2019;t give your grandmother any trouble. And one more thing.&#x201d; Her mother leaned in closer and wagged a finger. &#x201c;Try not to pick up any of those awful expressions like y&#x2019;all or ain&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s just not ladylike. Understand me?&#x201d;</p><p>Before Ibby could answer, Vidrine reached over, opened the door, and pushed her out of the car.</p></p><h2>All-American Ads 60s</h2><p>FROM FORGOTTEN CARS SUCH AS THE DODGE DART, TO CIGARETTES (&#34;&#34;THIS CHRISTMAS GIVE CARTONS OF LUCKIES&#34;&#34;) TO FOOD (MMM!

I&#x2019;d noticed that the first time we&#x2019;d all been assembled here, in this way. Instead, it was a command, an order. The &#x201c;please&#x201d; was just for show.</p><p>My brother stood up. Beside me, my mom tensed, sucking in a breath. Like the way they tell you to inhale before an X-ray so they can see more, get it all. My father stared straight forward, as always, his face impossible to read.</p><p>The judge was talking again, but I couldn&#x2019;t seem to listen. Instead, I looked over to the tall windows, the trees blowing back and forth outside. It was early August; school started in three weeks. It felt like I had spent the entire summer in this very room, maybe in this same seat, but I knew that wasn&#x2019;t the case. Time just seemed to stop here. But maybe, for people like Peyton, that was exactly the point.</p><p>It was only when my mother gasped, bending forward to grab the bench in front of us, that I realized the sentence had been announced. I looked up at my brother. He&#x2019;d been known for his fearlessness all the way back to when we were kids playing in the woods behind our house. But the day those older boys had challenged him to walk across that wide, gaping sinkhole on a skinny branch and he did it, his ears had been bright red. He was scared. Then and now.</p><p>There was a bang of the gavel, and we were dismissed. The attorneys turned to my brother, one leaning in close to speak while the other put a hand on his back. People were getting up, filing out, and I could feel their eyes on us as I swallowed hard and focused on my hands in my lap. Beside me, my mother was sobbing.</p><p>&#x201c;Sydney?&#x201d; Ames said. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t answer, so I just nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; my father said, getting to his feet. He took my mom&#x2019;s arm, then gestured for me to walk ahead of them, up to where the lawyers and Peyton were.</p><p>&#x201c;I have to go to the ladies&#x2019; room,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>My mom, her eyes red, just looked at me. As if this, after all that had happened, was the thing that she simply could not bear.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; Ames said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take her.&#x201d;</p><p>My father nodded, clapping him on the shoulder as we passed. Out in the courthouse lobby, I could see people pushing the doors open, out into the light outside, and I wished more than anything that I was among them.</p><p>Ames put his arm around me as we walked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wait for you here,&#x201d; he said when we reached the ladies&#x2019; room. &#x201c;Okay?&#x201d;</p><p>Inside, the light was bright, unforgiving, as I walked to the sinks and looked at myself in the mirror there. My face was pale, my eyes dark, flat, and empty.</p><p>A stall door behind me opened and a girl came out. She was about my height, but smaller, slighter. As she stepped up beside me, I saw she had blonde hair, plaited in a messy braid that hung over one shoulder, a few wisps framing her face, and she wore a summer dress, cowboy boots, and a denim jacket. I felt her look at me as I washed my hands once, then twice, before grabbing a towel and turning to the door.</p><p>I pushed it open, and there was Ames, directly across the hallway, leaning against the wall with his arms folded over his chest. When he saw me, he stood up taller, taking a step forward. I hesitated, stopping, and the girl, also leaving, bumped into my back.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh! Sorry!&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I told her, turning around. &#x201c;It was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my fault.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked at me for a second, then past my shoulder, at Ames. I watched her green eyes take him in, this stranger, for a long moment before turning her attention back to me. I had never seen her before. But with a single look at her face, I knew exactly what she was thinking.</p><p><i>You okay?</i></p><p>I was used to being invisible. People rarely saw me, and if they did, they never looked close. I wasn&#x2019;t shiny and charming like my brother, stunning and graceful like my mother, or smart and dynamic like my friends. That&#x2019;s the thing, though. You always think you want to be noticed. Until you are.</p><p>The girl was still watching me, waiting for an answer to the question she hadn&#x2019;t even said aloud. And maybe I would have answered it. But then I felt a hand on my elbow. Ames.</p><p>&#x201c;Sydney? You ready?&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t reply to this, either. Somehow we were heading toward the lobby, where my parents were now standing with the lawyers. As we walked, I kept glancing behind me, trying to see that girl, but could not in the shifting crowd of people pressing into the courtroom. Once we were clear of them, though, I looked back one last time and was surprised to find her right where I&#x2019;d left her. Her eyes were still on me, like she&#x2019;d never lost sight of me at all.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER <br>2<br></p><p>THE FIRST thing you saw when you walked into our house was a portrait of my brother. It hung directly across from the huge glass door, right above a wood credenza and the Chinese vase where my father stored his umbrellas. You&#x2019;d be forgiven if you never noticed either of these things, though. Once you saw Peyton, you couldn&#x2019;t take your eyes off him.</p><p>Though we shared the same looks (dark hair, olive skin, brown, almost black, eyes) he somehow carried them totally differently. I was average, kind of cute. But Peyton&#x2014;the second in our house, with my father Peyton the first&#x2014;was gorgeous. I&#x2019;d heard him compared to everything from movie idols of long before my time to fictional characters tromping across Scottish moors. I was pretty sure my brother was unaware as a child of the attention he received in supermarkets or post office lines. I wondered how it had felt when he&#x2019;d suddenly understood the effect his looks had on people, women especially. Like discovering a superpower, both thrilling and daunting, all at once.</p><p>Before all that, though, he was just my brother. Three years older, blue King Combat sheets on his bed in contrast to my pink Fairy Foo ones. I basically worshipped him. How could I not? He was the king of Truth or Dare (he always went with the latter, naturally), the fastest runner in the neighborhood, and the only person I&#x2019;d ever seen who could stand, balanced, on the handlebars of a rolling bicycle.</p><p>But his greatest talent, to me, was disappearing.</p><p>We played a lot of hide-and-seek as kids, and Peyton took it <i>seriously</i>. Ducking behind the first chair spotted in a room, or choosing the obvious broom closet? Those were for amateurs. My brother would fold himself beneath the cabinet under the bathroom sink, flatten completely under a bedspread, climb up the shower stall to spread across the ceiling, somehow holding himself there. Whenever I asked him for his secrets, he&#x2019;d just smile. &#x201c;You just have to find the invisible place,&#x201d; he told me. Only he could see it, though.</p><p>We practiced wrestling moves in front of cartoons on weekend mornings, fought over whom the dog loved more (just guess), and spent the hours after school we weren&#x2019;t in activities (soccer for him, gymnastics for me) exploring the undeveloped green space behind our neighborhood. This is how my brother still appears to me whenever I think of him: walking ahead of me on a crisp day, a stick in his hand, through the dappled fall colors of the woods. Even when I was nervous we&#x2019;d get lost, Peyton never was. That fearlessness again. A flat landscape never appealed to him. He always needed something to push up against. When things got bad with Peyton, I always wished we were back there, still walking. Like we hadn&#x2019;t reached where we were going yet, and there was still a chance it might be somewhere else.</p><p>I was in sixth grade when things began to change. Until then, we had both been on the lower campus of Perkins Day, the private school we&#x2019;d attended since kindergarten. That year, though, he moved to Upper School. Within a couple of weeks, he&#x2019;d started hanging out with a bunch of juniors and seniors. They treated him like a mascot, daring him to do stupid stuff like lifting Popsicles from the cafeteria line or climbing into a car trunk to sneak off campus for lunch. This was when Peyton&#x2019;s legend began in earnest. He was bigger than life, bigger than <i>our</i> lives.</p><p>Meanwhile, when I didn&#x2019;t have gymnastics, I was now riding the bus home solo, then eating my snack alone at the kitchen island. I had my own friends, of course, but most of them were highly scheduled, never around on weekday afternoons due to various activities. This was typical of our neighborhood, the Arbors, where the average household could support any extracurricular activity from Mandarin lessons to Irish dancing and everything in between. Financially, my family was about average for the area. My father, who started his career in the military before going to law school, had made his money in corporate conflict resolution. He was the guy called when a company had a problem&#x2014;threat of a lawsuit, serious issues between employees, questionable practices about to be brought to light&#x2014;and needed it worked out. It was no wonder I grew up believing there was no problem my father couldn&#x2019;t solve. For much of my life, I&#x2019;d never seen any proof otherwise.</p><p>If Dad was the general, my mom was the chief operating officer. Unlike some parents, who approached parenting as a tag-team sport, in our family the duties were very clearly divided. My father handled the bills, house, and yard upkeep, and my mom dealt with everything else. Julie Stanford was That Mother, the one who read every parenting book and stocked her minivan with enough snacks and sports equipment for every kid in the neighborhood. Like my dad, if my mom did something, she did it right. Which was why it was all the more surprising when, eventually, things went wrong anyway.</p><p>The trouble with Peyton started in the winter of his tenth grade year. One afternoon I was watching TV in the living room with a bowl of popcorn when the doorbell rang. When I looked outside, I saw a police car in the driveway.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom?&#x201d; I called upstairs. She was in her office, which was basically command central for our entire house. My dad called it the War Room. &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know why I didn&#x2019;t tell her it was the police. It just seemed saying it might make it real, and I wasn&#x2019;t sure what was out there yet.</p><p>&#x201c;Sydney, you are perfectly capable of answering the door,&#x201d; she replied, but sure enough, a beat later I heard her coming down the stairs.</p><p>I kept my eyes on the TV, where the characters from my favorite reality show, <i>Big New York</i>, were in the midst of yet another dinner party catfight. The Big franchise had been part of my afternoon ritual since Peyton had started high school, the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. Rich women being petty and pretty, I&#x2019;d heard it described, and that summed it up. There were about six different shows&#x2014;<i>Dallas</i>, <i>Los Angeles</i>, and <i>Chicago</i> among them&#x2014;enough so that I could easily watch two every day to fill the time between when I got home and dinner. I was so involved in the show, it was like they were my friends, and I often found myself talking back to the TV as if they could hear me, or thinking about their issues and problems even when I wasn&#x2019;t watching. It was a weird kind of loneliness, feeling that some of my closest friends didn&#x2019;t actually know I existed. But without them, the house felt so empty, even with my mom there, which made <i>me</i> feel empty in a way I&#x2019;d grown to dread the moment I stepped off the bus after school. My own life felt flat and sad too much of the time; it was reassuring, somehow, to lose myself in someone else&#x2019;s.</p><p>So I was watching Rosalie, the former actress, accuse Ayre, the model, of being a bully, when everything in our family&#x2019;s life shifted. One minute the door was shut and things were fine. The next, it was open and there was Peyton, a police officer beside him.</p><p>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; the cop said as my mother stepped back, putting a hand to her chest. &#x201c;Is this your son?&#x201d;</p><p>This was what I would remember later. This one question, the answer a no-brainer, and yet still one my parents, and Mom especially, would grapple with from that point on. Starting that day, when Peyton got caught smoking pot in the Perkins Day parking lot with his friends, my brother began a transformation into someone we didn&#x2019;t always recognize. There would be other visits from the authorities, trips to the police station, and, eventually, court dates and rehab stays. But it was this first one that stayed in my mind, crisp in detail. The bowl of popcorn, warm in my lap. Rosalie&#x2019;s sharp voice. And my mom, stepping back to let my brother inside. As the cop led him down the hallway to the kitchen, my brother looked at me. His ears were bright red.</p><p>Because he hadn&#x2019;t had any pot on his person, Perkins Day decided to handle the infraction itself, with a suspension and volunteer hours doing tutoring at the Lower School. The story&#x2014;especially the part about how Peyton was the only one who ran, forcing the cops to chase him down&#x2014;made the rounds, with how far he&#x2019;d gotten (a block, five, a mile) growing with each telling. My mom cried. My dad, furious, grounded him for a full month. Things didn&#x2019;t go back to the way they had been, though. Peyton came home and went to his room, staying there until dinner. He served his time, swore he&#x2019;d learned his lesson. Three months later, he got busted for breaking and entering.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a weird thing that happens when something goes from a one-time thing to a habit. Like the problem is no longer just a temporary houseguest but has actually moved in.</p><p>After that, we fell into a routine. My brother accepted his punishment and my parents slowly relaxed, accepting as fact their various theories about why this would never happen again. Then Peyton would get busted&#x2014;for drugs, shoplifting, reckless driving&#x2014;and we&#x2019;d all go back down the rabbit hole of charges, lawyers, court, and sentences.</p><p>After his first shoplifting arrest, when the cops found pot during his pat-down, Peyton went to rehab. He returned with a thirty-day chip on his key chain and interest in playing guitar thanks to his roommate at Evergreen Care Center. My parents paid for lessons and made plans to outfit part of the basement as a small studio so he could record his original compositions. The work was halfway done when the school found a small amount of pills in his locker.</p><p>He got suspended for three weeks, during which time he was supposed to be staying home, getting tutored and preparing for his court date. Two days before he was due to go back to school, I was awakened out of a deep sleep by the rumbling of the garage door opening. I looked out the window to see my dad&#x2019;s car backing onto our street. My clock said three fifteen a.m.</p><p>I got up and went out into the hallway, which was dark and quiet, then padded down the stairs. A light was on in the kitchen. There I found my mother, in her pajamas and a U sweatshirt, making a pot of coffee. When she saw me, she just shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Go back to sleep,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll fill you in tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>By the next morning, my brother had been bailed out, charged yet again with breaking and entering, this time with added counts of trespassing and resisting arrest. The previous evening, after my parents had gone to bed, he&#x2019;d snuck out of his room, walked up our road, then climbed the fence around the Vill...</p></p><h2>Chicago: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>A big-shouldered, big-trouble thriller set in mobbed-up 1920s Chicago&#x2015;a city where some people knew too much, and where everyone should have known better&#x2015;by the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of <em>The Untouchables</em> and Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning playwright of <em>Glengarry Glen Ross.</em></strong></p><p>Mike Hodge&#x2015;veteran of the Great War, big shot of the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, medium fry&#x2015;probably shouldn&#x2019;t have fallen in love with Annie Walsh.

And with his parents off at a resort and his older sister shirking her babysitting duties, Victor has plenty of time to indulge himself and to try a few things he&#x2019;s been curious about. Exploring the nearby city of Hogboro, he runs into a curious character known as the Chicken Man (a reference to his companion, an intelligent hen named Claudia who lives under his hat). The Chicken Man speaks brilliant nonsense, but he seems to be hip to the lizard musicians (real lizards, not men in lizard suits) who&#x2019;ve begun appearing on Victor&#x2019;s television after the broadcast of the late-late movie. Are the lizards from outer space? From &#x201c;other space&#x201d;?

This edition of Cresson H. Kearny&#39;s iconic Nuclear War Survival Skills (originally published in 1979), updated by Kearny himself in 1987 and again in 2001, offers expert advice for ensuring your family&#39;s safety should the worst come to pass. Chock-full of practical instructions and preventative measures, Nuclear War Survival Skills is based on years of meticulous scientific research conducted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Featuring a new introduction by ex-Navy SEAL Don Mann, this book also includes: instructions for six different fallout shelters, myths and facts about the dangers of nuclear weapons, tips for maintaining an adequate food and water supply, a foreword by &#34;the father of the hydrogen bomb,&#34; physicist Dr. Edward Teller, and an &#34;About the Author&#34; note by Eugene P. Wigner, physicist and Nobel Laureate. Written at a time when global tensions were at their peak, Nuclear War Survival Skills remains relevant in the dangerous age in which we now live. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Cresson H. Kearny was a graduate of the Texas Military Institute and of Princeton University. He worked for Standard Oil in Venezuela and served in the US Army as a captain in the Panama Mobile Force. Many of his jungle-tested inventions were used by US infantrymen in WWII.

He died in 2003.</p><p></p><h2>A Stab in the Dark</h2><p>Still grieving over the accidental death of an innocent child caught in crossfire, Matthew Scudder privately takes on the case of a mass-murder victim and begins a search for a phantom psychotic killer. Reissue.</p><p>A Mystery Writers of America Grand Master, Lawrence Block is a four-time winner of the Edgar Allan Poe and Shamus Awards, as well as a recipient of prizes in France, Germany, and Japan. The author of more than fifty books and numerous short stories, he is a devout New Yorker who spends much of his time traveling.<p></p>Though Roberts is an expressive, earnest narrator, fans of Block&#39;s endlessly satisfying Matthew Scudder mysteries will find the tone of this reading somehow off. Block&#39;s writing is understated and restrained, reflecting his hero&#39;s resigned acceptance of humankind&#39;s darker nature. Scudder is not surprised by the failings of people, including himself. Roberts&#39;s reading is showy, infused with an incredulity that is simply not in keeping with Scudder&#39;s informed fatalism. Still, this is a Scudder mystery, and listeners will enjoy his relentless investigation into the brutal nine-year-old murder of a pregnant woman. The novel is early in the Scudder series, by the way, and an important stepping-stone on his way to sobriety. M.O.

The three books are primarily written for undergraduate electrical and computer engineering students. They could also be used for professionals learning the ARM platform. The first book Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers is an introduction to computers and interfacing focusing on assembly language and C programming. This second book focuses on interfacing and system-level design. The third book Embedded Systems: Real-Time Operating Systems for ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers is an advanced book focusing on operating systems, high-speed interfacing, control systems, and robotics. An embedded system is a system that performs a specific task and has a computer embedded inside. Topics include design, verification, hardware/software synchronization, interfacing devices to the computer, timing diagrams, real-time systems, data collection and processing, motor control, analog and digital filters, real-time signal processing, low-power design, and the internet of things. In general, the area of embedded systems is an important and growing discipline within electrical and computer engineering. The educational market of embedded system is dominated by simple microcontrollers like the PIC, 9S12, and 8051. This is because of their market share, low cost, and historical dominance. However, as problems become more complex, so must the systems that solve them. A number of embedded system paradigms must shift in order to accommodate this growth in complexity. First, the number of calculations per second will increase from about 1 million/sec to 1 billion/sec. Similarly, the number of lines of software code will also increase from thousands to millions. Thirdly, systems will involve multiple microcontrollers supporting many simultaneous operations. Lastly, the need for system verification will continue to grow as these systems are deployed into safety critical applications. These changes are more than a simple growth in size and bandwidth. These systems must employ parallel programming, DMA synchronization, real-time operating systems, fault tolerant design, priority interrupt handling, and networking. Consequently, it will be important to provide our students with these types of design experiences. The ARM platform is both low cost and provides the high performance features required in future embedded systems. The ARM market share is currently large and growing. Furthermore, students trained on the ARM will be equipped to design systems across the complete spectrum from simple to complex. The purpose of writing this book at this time is to bring engineering education into the 21st century. This book employs many approaches to learning. It will not include an exhaustive recapitulation of the information in data sheets. First, it begins with basic fundamentals, which allows the reader to solve new problems with new technology. Second, the book presents many detailed design examples. These examples illustrate the process of design. There are multiple structural components that assist learning. Checkpoints, with answers in the back, are short easy to answer questions providing immediate feedback while reading. Simple homework provide more detailed learning opportunities. The book includes an index and a glossary so that information can be searched. The most important learning experience in a class like this are of course the laboratories. Each chapter has suggested lab assignments. More detailed lab descriptions are available on the web. The book will cover embedded systems for the ARM Cortex-M with specific details on the TM4C123, and TM4C1294. Although the solutions are specific for the Tiva TM4C, it will be possible to use this book for other ARM derivatives.</p><p>Jonathan Valvano has been teaching microcontrollers and embedded systems at the University of Texas at Austin for 35 years.

The book is guided by two contemporary frameworks that direct the successful management of speech sound disorders in children: evidence-based practice (EBP) and the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health&#x2014;Children and Youth (ICF-CY). The foundation knowledge covers important topics including defining the population, types of speech sound disorders, anatomical structures, articulation and transcription of speech sounds, and theoretical foundations of speech and speech acquisition. Practical evidence-based knowledge is covered in chapters that mirror the stages of contact when working with children with speech sound disorders including assessment, analysis, goal setting, intervention principles and plans, intervention procedures, phonological interventions, motor speech interventions, and the conduct of EBP. The last chapter provides comprehensive clinical information for five clinical cases, including transcribed speech samples, case history information, assessment results and other real-life material. Throughout, readers are directed to complete clinical application tasks, drawing on the case-based information in this final chapter. </p></p><p><p> <b>Sharynne McLeod,</b> Ph.D. is a speech-language pathologist and professor of speech and language acquisition from Charles Sturt University, Australia.

"For those who began to write at the end of the twenties or the beginning of the thirties, there were two great inescapable influences: Proust and Freud, who are mutually complementary." With its sweeping digressions into the past and reflections on the nature of memory, Proust's oceanic novel <em>In Search of Lost Time</em> looms over twentieth-century literature as one of the greatest, yet most endlessly challenging literary experiences. Influencing writers like Virginia Woolf and James Joyce, and even anticipating Albert Einstein in its philosophical explorations of space and time, <em>In Search of Lost Time</em> is a monumental achievement and a virtual rite of passage for any serious lover of literature.</p><p>Now, in what renowned translator Arthur Goldhammer says might be "likened to a piano reduction of an orchestral score," the French illustrator St�phane Heuet re-presents Proust in graphic form for anyone who has always dreamed of reading him but was put off by the sheer magnitude of the undertaking. This graphic adaptation reveals the fundamental architecture of Proust&#x2019;s work while displaying a remarkable fidelity to his language as well as the novel's themes of time, art, and the elusiveness of memory. As Goldhammer writes in his introduction, the compression required by this kind of adaptation As Goldhammer writes in his introduction, "the reader new to Proust must attend closely, even in this compressed rendering, to the novel's circling rhythms and abrupt cross-cuts between different places and times. But this necessary attentiveness is abetted and facilitated by the compactness of the graphic format.&#x201d;</p><p>In this first volume, <em>Swann's Way</em>, the narrator Marcel, an aspiring writer, recalls his childhood when&#x2015;in a now immortal moment in literature&#x2015;the taste of a madeleine cake dipped in tea unleashes a torrent of memories about his family&#x2019;s country home in the town of Combray. Here, Heuet and Goldhammer use Proust's own famously rich and labyrinthine sentences and discerning observations to render Combray like never before. From the water lillies of the Vivonne to the steeple and stained glass of the town church, Proust's language provides the blueprint for Heuet's illustrations. Heuet and Goldhammer also capture Proust's humor, wit, and sometimes scathing portrayals of Combray's many memorable inhabitants, like the lovelorn Charles Swann and the object of his affection and torment, Odette de Cr�cy; Swann's daughter Gilberte; local aristocrat the Duchesse de Guermantes; the narrator's uncle Adolphe; and the hypochondriac Aunt L�onie.</p><p>Including a Proust family tree, a glossary of terms, and a map of Paris, this graphic adaptation is a surprising and useful companion piece to Proust&#x2019;s masterpiece for both the initiated and those seeking an introduction.</p></p><p><p><strong>Marcel Proust</strong> (1871&#x2013;1922) was a French novelist, essayist, and critic, most famous for his autobiographical series of novels, <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>.</p><p><strong>St�phane Heuet</strong> is a French comic artist who is five volumes into his comic adaptation of <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>.

The night was overcast, the air a few degrees above freezing. It was the early hours of the morning, and the noise of the clubs and bars had faded to a distant murmur until the loudest sound from the city around us was the whine of the wind.</p><p>Inside, the warmth of the living room held back the cold. Variam was sitting on the sofa with Anne tending to him. Luna was pacing back and forth beside the table, while I was leaning against the wall next to the mantelpiece, my arms folded and my head down. There was a tension in the air.</p><p>&#x201c;You should have got out earlier,&#x201d; Luna said, still pacing. Invisible to normal sight, the silver-grey mist of her curse swirled and snapped around her. Luna&#x2019;s curse is tied to her emotions; being around her when she was angry used to be dangerous. She&#x2019;s better now, but the movements of her curse still broadcast her emotional state to anyone with the skill to see it.</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t have time,&#x201d; Variam said.</p><p>&#x201c;We said to evac when the alarm was raised.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We needed a couple more minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You do this every time. I told you the militia were coming in&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, they weren&#x2019;t the problem, were they?&#x201d; Variam twisted around to face Luna. &#x201c;If we&#x2019;d&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Vari,&#x201d; Anne said.</p><p>&#x201c;Fine, okay.&#x201d; Variam turned back to where he&#x2019;d been before. Anne placed one hand on Variam&#x2019;s left shoulder and the other on his wrist, and went back to studying the limb, eyes slightly narrowed.</p><p>My eyes rested on Variam&#x2019;s arm. The sleeve of his coat was brittle and shredded from where the ice blast had hit, and the skin beneath was swollen and tinged an unnatural bluish-white. I wanted badly to ask Anne whether he&#x2019;d be okay but knew it&#x2019;d only distract her. I&#x2019;d never yet seen Anne run up against an injury she couldn&#x2019;t heal, but there&#x2019;s always a first time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell was Talisid thinking?&#x201d; Luna asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be any magical security. He said&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I interrupted. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get into it when he picks up.&#x201d;</p><p>Luna is my apprentice, half-English and half-Italian with wavy light brown hair. Although she&#x2019;s an adept and only twenty-four, she&#x2019;s got more battle experience than most mages ten years her senior. She&#x2019;d been on backup duty for the mission this evening, and she&#x2019;d done her job well, but from the look in her eyes I knew she wanted to take her frustrations out on someone. Still, she kept quiet.</p><p>Anne straightened slightly from where she was sitting. It was only a small movement, but both Luna and I turned towards her. &#x201c;So?&#x201d; Luna asked before I could open my mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; Anne said in her soft voice.</p><p>I felt some of the tension go out of Luna, and to my eyes, the tendrils of mist around her slowed. &#x201c;How bad is it?&#x201d; I asked Anne.</p><p>Anne and Variam make an odd pair. Anne is tall and slender while Variam is small; where Anne is soft-spoken and shy, Variam is confident and quick. When the two of them are together, it&#x2019;s Variam who usually stands out in the conversation, while Anne&#x2019;s content to stay in the background. Despite that, it&#x2019;s Anne who might be the more powerful of the two. She&#x2019;s a life mage, and due to various events that she doesn&#x2019;t like to talk about, she was forced from a young age to become very good with her magic. It&#x2019;s given her more than her share of issues, but it&#x2019;s also made her the best healer I know.</p><p>&#x201c;The skin, nerves, and blood vessels are frozen along the left side,&#x201d; Anne said. &#x201c;But there&#x2019;s no serious tendon damage and the muscles are okay. It&#x2019;ll take me ten minutes or so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting slow,&#x201d; Variam said.</p><p>&#x201c;Regrowing nerves <i>is</i> slow. Unless you don&#x2019;t want to be able to feel anything along your forearm&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s just being a dick,&#x201d; Luna said. &#x201c;Vari, shut up and let her work.&#x201d;</p><p>Variam rolled his eyes. Green light began to glow around Anne&#x2019;s hands, spreading into Variam&#x2019;s arm as Anne&#x2019;s healing magic took hold. It wasn&#x2019;t the first time I&#x2019;d seen Anne heal Variam, or the fifth for that matter, and the two of them made it look very everyday and ordinary. All the same, I couldn&#x2019;t help but think of how close it had been. I&#x2019;d shouted a warning, but if Variam had been just a little slower to get that shield up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>There was a chime from the mantelpiece. Luna&#x2019;s head snapped up instantly, but I was already reaching for the item that had made the sound: a small blue-purple disc with serrated edges. I picked it up and channelled a thread of magic through its centre.</p><p>The edges of the disc lit up and a small figure materialised at the centre, twelve inches tall and sculpted from blue light. The shape was that of a man, middle-aged and straight-backed, with thinning hair. &#x201c;Verus,&#x201d; the figure said. His voice was as clear as if he&#x2019;d been standing in front of me. &#x201c;How did it go?&#x201d;</p><p>My name&#x2019;s Alexander Verus. The &#x201c;Verus&#x201d; part is my mage name, the &#x201c;Alex&#x201d; part comes from my parents, and I go by either or both depending on which society I&#x2019;m interacting with and how much I like the person I&#x2019;m talking to. I&#x2019;m a diviner, which means that I can perceive the sensory data of my short- to medium-term potential futures in the form of if-then conditionals.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve also got some serious long-term problems, most of which stem from my history. Mages are split into two factions, and I was originally trained by a particularly notorious Dark mage named Richard Drakh. The mage I was talking to through the communication focus, Talisid, was from the other faction&#x2014;the Light Council, the dominant power in magical society&#x2014;and I&#x2019;d been working for him on and off for several years. It had been a low-key, freelance relationship&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at least until last April, when Anne was kidnapped and taken away into the shadow realm of her old master, Sagash.</p><p>I went after Anne and found her, and together we fought our way out. But despite all the battles and dangers we went through, it wouldn&#x2019;t have been even a footnote in the records as far as any other mages were concerned, except for one thing. While I&#x2019;d been in Sagash&#x2019;s shadow realm, we&#x2019;d run into my old master, Richard.</p><p>There had already been rumours of Richard&#x2019;s return. When I told my story, it was treated with the same scepticism as the rumours. I&#x2019;d only seen someone who <i>looked</i> like Richard&#x2014;it could have been an illusion, or a construct, or some other trick. Richard had been gone for eleven years, and as far as many of the Light mages were concerned, this was probably just someone trying to trade on his old reputation. But I knew that it hadn&#x2019;t been a trick. It had been Richard, returned after all this time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and worst of all, he hadn&#x2019;t forgotten about me. He&#x2019;d asked us to join him.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t matter that we&#x2019;d said no. I never came to really know Richard back when I was his apprentice&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t think anyone did&#x2014;but there were some things about him of which I was certain. One was that he was very, very patient. And another was that when he wanted something, he took it. In my mind, ever since that April, a clock had been ticking. I didn&#x2019;t know how much time was left on it, but I knew that sooner or later it would run out.</p><p>One mage who hadn&#x2019;t been sceptical was Talisid. He&#x2019;d believed the rumours of Richard&#x2019;s return even before I had, and in the months since then, he&#x2019;d begun approaching me more often, asking for my help with operations. Surveillance, reconnaissance, even some covert insertions, all with the same ultimate goal: finding out what Richard was doing, and how to stop him.</p><p>Things were easy at first. We discovered that Richard had returned to his old base of operations, the mansion in Wales. Once he&#x2019;d set up again, he started to receive visitors in increasing numbers. All were Dark mages. We couldn&#x2019;t get close enough to risk actually eavesdropping on one of the meetings, but we were able to discover that Richard was trying to build a coalition, uniting as many Dark mages as he could. At the same time, another Dark mage named Morden was making a push to get Dark mages admitted to the Light Council. From several pieces of information that we&#x2019;d uncovered, we were sure that the two of them were working together. Morden was the public face, dealing with the mages on the Light side of the fence, while Richard kept the Dark mages in line. A few Dark mages had spoken out against Morden&#x2019;s proposal; all had disappeared without a trace shortly afterwards.</p><p>But since October, our investigations had become harder. We&#x2019;d taken all the low-hanging fruit, and the closer we drew to Richard&#x2019;s real secrets, the more we risked revealing ourselves. Talisid started sending us further afield, chasing rumours with no guarantee of safety or success. Some of the leads we pursued turned out to have nothing to do with Richard at all, while others turned out to be dangerous.</p><p>The mission we&#x2019;d just returned from had been the second kind. Talisid had sent us to Idlib, a contested city within Syria. He&#x2019;d told us that there was a lightly guarded warehouse in the eastern district containing a shipment of goods intended for Richard&#x2019;s mansion. Talisid had been right about where the goods were headed. He hadn&#x2019;t been right about much else.</p><p>&#x201c;How did it go?&#x201d; I repeated. &#x201c;Badly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is everyone&#x2014;?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Alive, yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Healthy, no. We need to have a talk about your definition of &#x2018;lightly guarded.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The militia&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The militia weren&#x2019;t the problem,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Although there were a lot more of them than you said there would be. The <i>problem</i> was the ice elemental.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The kind that&#x2019;s seven feet tall, made of solid ice, and can freeze things from thirty feet away. I didn&#x2019;t stick around to classify it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You said there wasn&#x2019;t going to be any magical security,&#x201d; Luna cut in.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you get a look at the shipment?&#x201d; Talisid asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that all you care about?&#x201d; Luna demanded. &#x201c;What, it&#x2019;s okay if we get killed, just as long as&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what I meant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s the way it sounded!&#x201d;</p><p>I held up a hand. Luna&#x2019;s gaze flicked to me, and she shut up. She still looked pissed off, though, and I didn&#x2019;t blame her. &#x201c;Talisid,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;This is the second time in a row.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know. I&#x2019;m sorry. All of the information we have indicated that this militia group was entirely mundane.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And it didn&#x2019;t occur to you to wonder how a mundane group would be selling&#x2014;?&#x201d; I checked myself, took a breath. &#x201c;Forget it.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a moment&#x2019;s pause. Over on the sofa, Variam was listening in. Anne was still working on Variam&#x2019;s arm, the green light of her magic casting a soft glow. &#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t able to get close enough, then,&#x201d; Talisid said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, we got close enough,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;To some empty crates. Whatever that shipment was, it&#x2019;s gone. Your intel was wrong about that too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Empty?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure they&#x2014;?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m sure they were empty, and no, they weren&#x2019;t anywhere else in the warehouse. We checked. For as long as we could, anyway, until that elemental pulled its Mr. Freeze act. Whoever gave you those timings, they screwed up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see. Would it be feasible for your team to go back and do another sweep?&#x201d;</p><p>I stared at Talisid, then took a breath and counted to five in my head. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, once I was sure I could keep my voice calm. &#x201c;It would not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Talisid said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to need to make some calls. I&#x2019;ll get in touch with you when I know more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Until then.&#x201d; Talisid paused. &#x201c;I know there were setbacks, but well done on returning safely. We&#x2019;ll talk tomorrow.&#x201d; Talisid&#x2019;s image winked out and the lights around the edge of the communicator went dark.</p><p>&#x201c;Arsehole,&#x201d; Variam muttered.</p><p>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; Anne said. The green light around her hands faded and she let go of Variam&#x2019;s arm. She hadn&#x2019;t even glanced at Talisid throughout the whole conversation. &#x201c;Try moving.&#x201d;</p><p>Variam worked his arm, flexing his fingers, then nodded. &#x201c;Feels good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do we need to keep him warm?&#x201d; Luna asked.</p><p>Anne shook her head. &#x201c;No, you could get it frozen again and it wouldn&#x2019;t make any difference. Though I&#x2019;d rather you didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She glanced at me. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t tell him about the papers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. I walked to the armchair, then picked up some of the papers lying scattered over the table. There were a dozen or so sheets, grubby with dirt and damp and cracked at the edges from where the ice blast had grazed them. Variam had managed to keep hold of them during the fight.</p><p>&#x201c;Next time, leave the papers and just get out,&#x201d; Luna said.</p><p>&#x201c;Will you stop whining?&#x201d; Variam said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re alive, aren&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;</p><p>Luna scowled. &#x201c;Can you read them?&#x201d; Anne asked.</p><p>&#x201c;In Arabic?&#x201d; I said dryly. &#x201c;No.&#x201d; The papers had notes scribbled across them in a right-to-left scrawl. It could be battle plans, shipping manifestos, a history of Richard&#x2019;s dealings with the group&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or someone&#x2019;s laundry list, for all we knew. But there was a reason we&#x2019;d picked the things up: three of the pages were rubbings, not writings. They were crude and it was hard to figure out where they&#x2019;d been taken from, but if I&#x2019;d had to guess, I&#x2019;d have said that the pictures and text they showed looked old. More like carvings.</p><p>&#x201c;Are they from what was in those crates?&#x201d; Luna asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Or from something else,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to need a translator.&#x201d; Who not only spoke whichever dialect of Arabic this was written in, but also knew enough about Middle Eastern magical history to be able to identify the content. This wasn&#x2019;t going to be quick.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you going to go back if Talisid asks?&#x201d; Anne asked. Despite her spell, she didn&#x2019;t look tired. Life magic healing tends to drain the caster, but Anne&#x2019;s very good at what she does.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up with Talisid, anyway?&#x201d; Luna asked. &#x201c;When we did jobs for him before, this kind of thing didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s because of what Morden&#x2019;s doing, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Variam said. &#x201c;Talisid wants us to dig up some dirt.&#x201d;</p><p>Luna frowned. &#x201c;I thought the Council didn&#x2019;t buy that Morden&#x2019;s working for Richard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Variam said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve got him down as &#x2018;potential associate&#x2019; and that&#x2019;s it. If Talisid could prove that Richard&#x2019;s behind him, though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Talisid still won&#x2019;t tell me exactly who he works for, but I&#x2019;m pretty sure he&#x2019;s with the Guardian faction. And Richard&#x2019;s reputation still carries. If they could link Richard with Morden it&#x2019;d scare a lot of people off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, well, he hasn&#x2019;t done much of a job of it so far, has he?&#x201d; Variam said. &#x201c;And doesn&#x2019;t sound like his faction&#x2019;s winning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mm,&#x201d; I said. I wasn&#x2019;t sure how to feel about that.</p><p>Politics in the Light Council are complicated. There are seven primary factions: Guardians, Crusaders, Isolationists, Directors, Centrists, Weissians, and the Unity Bloc.

With its distinctive twin-guitar sound, studs-and-leather image, and international sales of over 50 million records, Judas Priest became the archetypal heavy metal band in the 1980s. Iconic tracks like "Breaking the Law," "Living after Midnight," and "You've Got Another Thing Comin'" helped the band achieve extraordinary success, but no one from the band has stepped out to tell their or the band's story until now.<br><br>As the band approaches its golden anniversary, fans will at last be able to delve backstage into the decades of shocking, hilarious, and haunting stories that surround the heavy metal institution. In <i>Heavy Duty</i>, guitarist K.K. Downing discusses the complex personality conflicts, the business screw-ups, the acrimonious relationship with fellow heavy metal band Iron Maiden, as well as how Judas Priest found itself at the epicenter of a storm of parental outrage that targeted heavy metal in the '80s. He also describes his role in cementing the band's trademark black leather and studs image that would not only become synonymous with the entire genre, but would also give singer Rob Halford a viable outlet by which to express his sexuality. Lastly, he recounts the life-changing moment when he looked at his bandmates on stage during a 2009 concert and thought, "This is the last show." Whatever the topic, whoever's involved, K.K. doesn't hold back.<br></p><p><b>Ken "K.K." Downing</b> is a guitarist and founding member of heavy metal band Judas Priest. He formed the band at the age of sixteen after getting kicked out of his home by his abusive father and the band eventually found success during the New Wave of British heavy metal in the late 1970s and into the 1980s. K.K. retired from the band in 2011 and lives in Shropshire, England.<br><br><b>Mark Eglinton </b>is a frequent cowriter whose previous collaborations include <i>Official Truth, 101 Proof</i> with Rex Brown of Pantera and <i>Confessions of a Heretic</i> with Behemoth's Adam "Nergal" Darski, along with the solo project <i>So Let It Be Written: The Biography of Metallica's James Hetfield</i>.

With its rich harvest of words and ideas, it brings the figure of Elen into focus more than ever before. And what a dazzling figure she is; part goddess, part dream, part saint, a green lady and a water nymph, primordial mother and patroness of deer, and guardian of the Old Straight Tracks and solar alignments. Her name is remembered even in healing plants. If this book does nothing more (and it will surely do much more) it will encourage people to dig deeper into the loam of tradition to follow the footsteps of the divine Elen of the Ways. Elen is as real as the roads named after her, as solid as the ancient paths that carry her presence and story across vast tracts of Britain and the European continent and beyond.

In <i>Enlivenment</i>, German philosopher Andreas Weber presents an alternative understanding of our relationship with nature, arguing not that humans control nature but that humans and nature exist in a commons of mutual transformation. There is no nature&#x2013;human dualism, he contends, because the fundamental dimension of existence is shared in what he calls "aliveness." All subjectivity is intersubjectivity. Self is self-through-other. Seeing all beings in a common household of matter, desire, and imagination, an economy of metabolic and economic transformation, is &#x201c;enlivenment.&#x201d; This perspective allows us to move beyond Enlightenment-style thinking that strips material reality of any subjectivity.</p><p>To take this step, Weber argues, we need to supplant the concept of <i>techn� </i>with the concept of <i>poiesis</i> as the element that brings forth reality. In a world not divided into things and ideas, culture and nature, reality arises from the creation of relationships and continuous fertile transformations; any thinking in terms of relationships comes about as a poetics. The self is always a function of the whole; the whole is equally a function of the individual. Only this integrated freedom allows humanity to reconcile with the natural world.</p><p>This first English edition of <i>Enlivenment</i> has been expanded and updated from the German edition.</p></p><p>Andreas Weber is a Berlin-based philosopher, biologist, and writer. He is the author of <i>The Biology of Wonder: Aliveness, Feeling, and the Metamorphosis of Science</i>; <i>Biopoetics: Towards an Existential Biology</i>; <i>Matter and Desire: An Erotic Ecology</i>; and other books. He teaches philosophy at Leuphana University, L�neburg, and the University of Fine Arts, Berlin.<p><i>Anthropocene</i>&nbsp;sounds cold: a humans-only world, dark and self-centered. <i>Enlivenment</i>&nbsp;is warm: a way to&nbsp;remain true to the wildfires that set humanity forth to celebrate this world. Bravo to Andreas Weber for daring to show us how to live&nbsp;in these fearful times.</p>&#x2015;<b>David Rothenberg</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Nightingales in Berlin</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Survival of the Beautiful</i></p><h2>The Concise Yoga Vasistha</h2><p>The Concise Yoga Vasistha a clear, provocative summary of one of the leading texts of Hinduism. Swami Venkatesananda continues the long tradition of elaborating on and clarifying the teachings of the sage Vasistha. It captures the verve of the original text while eliminating needless repetition. For the specialist, this book makes available a handy guide to the original Sanskrit without sacrificing philosophical depth. To the comparative religionist, it provides an occasion for understanding how Hinduism has been able to accommodate seemingly opposite schools of thought without giving way to the platitudes which mar many syncretic movements.</p><p>&#34;It is really quite a readable translation, and a good abridgement of an extremely long text. It includes most of the things that I like best in the Yoga Vasistha leaves out most of what I like least. It is certainly far and away the best thing available on this text, a text that never should have been neglected as it has been and never would have, had a translation as good as this been available.&#34; -- Wendy D.

She won the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction in 1983 and the National Book Award.<br>BROWNFIELD STOOD CLOSE to his mother in the yard, not taking his eyes off the back of the receding automobile. His Uncle Silas slowed the car as it got to a place where a pointed rock jutted up out of the road: a week before he had busted an oil pan there. Once past this spot, which he had cursed as he passed to and fro over it during the week, he stuck out his arm and waved jauntily back at them. Brownfield waved sadly, his eyes blurred with tears. His Aunt Marilyn, not visible through the rear window of the car, waved a dainty blue handkerchief from her front window. It fluttered merrily like a pennant. Brownfield's cousins had their faces pressed to the rear window, and their delicate, hard-to-see hands flopped monotonously up and down. They were tired of waving, for they had been waving good-bye since they finished breakfast.<br><br> The automobile was a new 1920 Buick, long and high and shiny green with great popping headlights like the eyes of a frog. Inside the car it was all blue, with seats that were fuzzy and soft. Slender silver handles opened the doors and rolled the astonishingly clear windows up and down. As it bumped over the road its canvas top was scratched by low elm branches. Brownfield felt embarrassed about the bad road and the damage it did to his uncle's car. Uncle Silas loved his car and had spent all morning washing it, polishing the wheel spokes and dusting off the running board. Now it bounced over gullies and potholes in the road, tossing Uncle Silas and his wife and children up in the air and slamming them down again. Brownfield sighed as the sound of metal against rock reached his ears. The road was for mules, wagons and bare feet only.<br><br> "A wagon'd be easier," said his father.<br><br> "But not nearly 'bout as grand as that." His mother looked after the car without envy, but wistfully.<br><br> Brownfield watched the automobile as it turned a curve and was finally out of sight. Then he watched the last of the dust settle. Already he missed his cousins, although they made him feel dumb for never having seen a picture show and for never having seen houses stacked one on top of the other until they nearly reached the sky. They had stayed a week and got over being impressed by his small knowledge of farming the first day. He showed them how to milk the cow, how to feed the pigs, how to find chickens' eggs; but the next day they had bombarded him with talk about automobiles and street lights and paved walks and trash collectors and about something they had ridden in once in a department store that went up, up, up from one floor to the next without anybody walking a step. He had been dazzled by this information and at last overwhelmed. They taunted him because he lived in the country and never saw anything or went anywhere. They told him that his father worked for a cracker and that the cracker owned him. They told him that their own daddy, his Uncle Silas, had gone to Philadelphia to be his own boss. They told him that his mother wanted to leave his father and go North to Philadelphia with them. They said that his mother wanted him, Brownfield, to go to school, and that she was tired of his father and wanted to leave him anyway. His cousins told Brownfield this and much more. They bewildered, excited and hurt him. Still, he missed them; they were from a world he had never seen. Now that they were gone he felt the way he usually felt only in winter, never in June; as if he were waiting for something to happen that would take a very long time to come.<br><br> "I wish we lived in Philydelphia," he said.<br><br> "Well, we don't." That was his father.<br><br> Brownfield looked at Grange with surprise. His father almost never spoke to him unless they had company. Even then he acted as if talking to his son was a strain, a burdensome requirement.<br><br> "Uncle Silas like to talk about his automobile," said Brownfield, his lips bumbling over the word. It was his uncle's word, a city word. In the country they always said car. Some people still called them buggies, as if they could not get used to a conveyance that did not use horses.<br><br> "I wish we had a automobile like that!"<br><br> "Well, we don't."<br><br> "No, we don't," said Margaret.<br><br> Brownfield frowned. His mother agreed with his father whenever possible. And though he was only ten Brownfield wondered about this. He thought his mother was like their dog in some ways. She didn't have a thing to say that did not in some way show her submission to his father.<br><br> "We ought to be thankful we got a roof over our heads and three meals a day."<br><br> It was actually more like one meal a day. His mother smiled at Brownfield, one of her rare sudden smiles that lit up her smooth, heart-shaped face. Her skin was rich brown with a creamy reddish sheen. Her teeth were small and regular and her breath was always sweet with a milky cleanness. Brownfield had hands like hers, long, thin aristocratic hands, with fingers meant for jewels. His mother had no wedding ring, however.<br><br>Brownfield listened to the familiar silence around him. Their house was at the end of the long rugged road that gave his uncle's car so much trouble. This road looked to be no more than a track where it branched off from the main road, which was of smoothly scraped dirt. The road scraper, a man on a big yellow machine like a tank, never scraped their road, which was why it was so rough and pitted with mud holes when it rained. The house was in a clearing and at the edge of the clearing was forest. Forest full of animals and birds. But they were not large animals or noisy birds and days passed sometimes without a sound and the sky seemed a round blue muffler made of wool.<br><br> Brownfield had been born here, in the vast cotton flats of southern Georgia, and had been conscious first of the stifling heat in summer, and then of the long periods of uninterrupted quiet. As a very small child he had scrambled around the clearing alone, chasing lizards and snakes, bearing his cuts and bruises with solemnity until his mother came home at night.<br><br> His mother left him each morning with a hasty hug and a sugartit, on which he sucked through wet weather and dry, across the dusty clearing or miry, until she returned. She worked all day pulling baits for ready money. Her legs were always clean when she left home and always coated with mud and slime of baits when she came back. The baits she "pulled" were packed in cans and sold in town to gentlemen who went fishing for the sport of it. His mother had taken Brownfield with her to the bait factory when he was a baby, but he was in the way, and the piles of squirming baits, which were dumped first for sorting on a long table, terrified him. They had looked like a part of the table until one day his mother sat him down near them and he rolled over and became entangled in them. It seemed to him the baits moved with a perfectly horrifying blind wriggling. He had screamed and screamed. His mother was ordered to take him out of there at once and never to bring him back.<br><br> At first she left him home in a basket, with his sugartit pressed against his face. He sucked on it all day until it was nothing but a tasteless rag. Then, when he could walk, she left him on the porch steps. In moments of idle sitting he shared the steps with their lean mangy dog. And as the flies buzzed around the whiskered snout of the dog they buzzed around his face. No one was there to shoo them away, or to change the sodden rag that attracted them, and which he wore brownish and damp around his distended waist. For hours he was lost in a dull, weak stupor. His hunger made him move in a daze, his heavy eyes unnaturally bright.<br><br> When he was four he was covered with sores. Tetter sores covered his head, eating out his hair in patches the size of quarters. Tomato sores covered his legs up to the knee-when the tomatoes in his mother's garden were ripe he ate nothing but tomatoes all day long-and pus ran from boils that burst under his armpits. His mother washed the sores in bluestone water. Suddenly, out of his days of sitting and of picking the scabs from his sores, there evolved a languid slow order of jobs he had to do. He fed the pigs, brought in wood and led the cow all over the clearing looking for fresh grass. When he was six his mother taught him how to feed and milk the cow. Then he became fond of the calm, slow patience of the cow and loved to catch her rich milk in a tin syrup pail and drink it warm and dribbling down his chin.<br><br>His father worked: planting, chopping, poisoning and picking in the cotton field, which ran for half a mile along the main road. Brownfield had worked there too now, for four years, since he was six, in the company of other child workers. His father worked with men and women in another part of the field. The cotton field too was generally silent. The children were too tired to play and were encouraged not to play because of the cotton. The grownups talked softly, intermittently, like the sporadic humming of wasps. The buzz of their conversations became part of the silence, for nothing they said came clearly across the field to where the children worked.<br><br> At the end of the day all the workers stopped. There were close to twenty grownups, and each had several children who worked in the children's section of the field. The children's job was to go over the rows their parents had gone over the week before-"scrapping cotton" it was called. When the children saw their parents put down their sacks they came and stood beside them at the edge of the field as all of them waited for the truck to come. Brownfield waited for the truck along with his father. His father never looked at him or acknowledged him in any way, except to lift his sack of cotton to the back of the truck when it arrived. Brownfield was afraid of his father's silence, and his fear reached its peak when the truck came. For when the truck came his father's face froze into an unnaturally bland mask, curious and unsettling to see. It was as if his father became a stone or a robot. A grim stillness settled over his eyes and he became an object, a cipher, somethin...</p><h2>A Crown Imperiled: Book Two of the Chaoswar Saga (Chaoswar Saga, 2)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Feist constantly amazes.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;SF Site</p><p>&#x201c;Feist has a command of language and a natural talent for keeping the reader turning pages.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x2014;<em>Chicago Sun-Times</em></p><p>The Chaoswar&#x2014;the fifth and final Riftwar&#x2014;is in full, explosive swing in Raymond E.

But the face of global conflict is ever-changing. In <em>Out of the Mountains</em>, David Kilcullen, one of the world's leading experts on current and future conflict, offers a groundbreaking look at what may happen after today's wars end. This is a book about future conflicts and future cities, and about the challenges and opportunities that four powerful megatrends--population, urbanization, coastal settlement, and connectedness--are creating across the planet. And it is about what cities, communities and businesses can do to prepare for a future in which all aspects of human society--including, but not limited to, conflict, crime and violence--are changing at an unprecedented pace. <br><br>Kilcullen argues that conflict is increasingly likely to occur in sprawling coastal cities, in peri-urban slum settlements that are enveloping many regions of the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia, and in highly connected, electronically networked settings. He suggests that cities, rather than countries, are the critical unit of analysis for future conflict and that resiliency, not stability, will be the key objective. Ranging across the globe--from Kingston to Mogadishu to Lagos to Benghazi to Mumbai--he offers a unified theory of "competitive control" that explains how non-state armed groups such as drug cartels, street gangs, and warlords draw their strength from local populations, providing useful ideas for dealing with these groups and with diffuse social conflicts in general. His extensive fieldwork on the ground in a series of urban conflicts suggests that there will be no military solution for many of the struggles we will face in the future. We will need to involve local people deeply to address problems that neither outsiders nor locals alone can solve, drawing on the insight only locals can bring, together with outsider knowledge from fields like urban planning, systems engineering, renewable energy, conflict resolution and mediation. <br><br>This deeply researched and compellingly argued book provides an invaluable roadmap to a future that will increasingly be crowded, urban, coastal, connected--and dangerous.<br></p><p><p><b> A Look Inside: <em>Out of the Mountains: The Coming Age of the Urban Guerrilla</em> [Click Images to Enlarge]</b></p> A mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle (MRAP), a few minutes before the ambush in Dara-i Nur District, Afghanistan, September 10, 2009.

Drawing on his experiences with three professional development programs, author Mark Driscoll outlines key "habits of thinking" that characterize the successful learning and use of algebra. He offers strategies teachers can use to cultivate these habits of thinking and guidelines for assessing students' development.</p><p><i>Fostering Algebraic Thinking</i> is organized according to the critical challenges algebra teachers face. Excerpts from discussions among the classroom teachers who participated in the professional development projects help place these issues in context. Each chapter also includes activities to encourage teachers to reflect on how they think about algebra and how that thinking informs their practice. There are also samples and analyses of student work to help teachers identify patterns of algebraic thinking along with questions and strategies that can be used to guide and extend students' thinking.</p></p><p><p>Mark Driscoll is a nationally recognized leader in mathematics education who designs instructional resources and professional development materials that build mathematics teachers' capacity to enhance students' understanding and improve their learning outcomes.

Suzuki</h2><p>No other figure in history has played a bigger part in opening the West to Buddhism than the eminent Zen author, D.T. Suzuki, and in this reissue of his best work readers are given the very heart of Zen teaching. <i>Zen Buddhism</i>, which sold more than 125,000 as an Anchor paperback after its publication in 1956, includes a basic historical background as well as a thorough overview of the techniques for Zen practice. Concepts and terminology such as <i>satori, zazen,</i> and <i>koans,</i> as well as the various elements of this philosophy are all given clear explanations. But while Suzuki takes nothing for granted in the reader's understanding of the fundamentals, he does not give a merely rudimentary overview. Each of the essays included here, particularly those on the unconscious mind and the relation of Zen to Western philosophy, go far beyond other sources for their penetrating insights and timeless wisdom.<br>What is most important about D.T. Suzuki's work, however--and what comes across so powerfully in these selections--is his unparalleled ability to communicate the experiential aspect of Zen. The intensity here with which Zen philosophy comes to life is without parallel in the canon of Buddhist literature. Suzuki stands apart from all teachers before or since because of his exceptional ability to eloquently capture in words the seemingly inexpressible essence of Zen.</p><p>The premier metaphysician of the 20th century, Martin Heidegger, once said in regard to D. T. Suzuki, "If I understand this man correctly, this is what I have been trying to say in all my writings." Roman Catholic writer Thomas Merton, analytical psychologist Carl Jung, social psychologist Erich Fromm, avant-garde musician John Cage, writer and social critic Alan Watts, poet Gary Snyder -- all influential in their own rights, claim a debt to Mr. Suzuki and his writings, the most representative of which are gathered here in <i>Zen Buddhism</i>. An intellectual understanding of Zen begins with this book.D. T. SUZUKI (1869&#x2013;1966), born and educated in Japan, was the chief emissary of Zen in the West. In addition to lecturing extensively throughout the world, he held teaching positions in Japan and at Columbia University. <br>WILLIAM BARRETT is a distinguished philosopher and teacher, and was instrumental in introducing existentialism to America.

Marxist analyses tend to presuppose European models of history and experience that downplay the significance of black people and black communities as agents of change and resistance. Black radicalism must be linked to the traditions of Africa and the unique experiences of blacks on western continents, Robinson argues, and any analyses of African American history need to acknowledge this.<br><br>To illustrate his argument, Robinson traces the emergence of Marxist ideology in Europe, the resistance by blacks in historically oppressive environments, and the influence of both of these traditions on such important twentieth-century black radical thinkers as W. E. B. Du Bois, C. L. R. James, and Richard Wright.<br><br></p><p>"I can say, without a trace of hyperbole, that this book changed my life. . . . Combining political theory, history, philosophy, cultural analysis, and biography, among other things, Robinson literally rewrites the history of the rise of the West from ancient times to the mid-twentieth century, tracing the roots of black radical thought to a shared epistemology among diverse African people and providing a withering critique of Western Marxism and its inability to comprehend either the racial character of capitalism and the civilization in which it was born or mass movements outside Europe. . . . <i>Black Marxism</i> remains as fresh and insightful as it was when it was first composed, still productively engaged with the central questions posed by histories of the African Diaspora."--Robin D. G. Kelley, from the Foreword <br>In this reissue of a 1983 classic, Robinson argues that Western Marxism is unable to comprehend either the racial character of capitalism or mass movements outside of Europe. Robinson combines political theory, history, philosophy, and cultural analysis to illustrate his argument and chronicles the influence of Marxist ideology and black resistance on such important black radical thinkers as W. E. B. Du Bois, C. L. R. James, and Richard Wright.</p><h2>The Sleeping Dictionary</h2><p><b>From an award-winning novelist, a stunning portrait of late Raj India&#x2014;a sweeping saga and a love story set against a background of huge political and cultural upheaval.</b><br><br><b>YOU ASK FOR MY NAME, THE REAL ONE, AND I CANNOT TELL. IT IS NOT FOR LACK OF EFFORT.</b><br> <br>In 1930, a great ocean wave blots out a Bengali village, leaving only one survivor, a young girl. As a maidservant in a British boarding school, Pom is renamed Sarah and discovers her gift for languages. Her private dreams almost die when she arrives in Kharagpur and is recruited into a secretive, decadent world. Eventually, she lands in Calcutta, renames herself Kamala, and creates a new life rich in books and friends. But although success and even love seem within reach, she remains trapped by what she is . . . and is not. As India struggles to throw off imperial rule, Kamala uses her hard-won skills&#x2014;for secrecy, languages, and reading the unspoken gestures of those around her&#x2014;to fight for her country&#x2019;s freedom and her own happiness.</p><p><i>The Sleeping Dictionary</i>, my latest novel, is my first &nbsp;historical suspense novel set in India. 'Why India?' a lot of people have asked, since I have a long-running mystery series set in Japan. I was not born in India, but my father was, and I've enjoyed long visits to his family hometown of Calcutta since childhood.<br>Calcutta's had a tough rap for poverty in a lot of fiction and films. Having been there so many times, I see more: a dynamic city of writers and artists, spectacular Indian and British colonial architecture, delicious cuisine, and political intrigue. It was once called the "City of Palaces" and was the capitol of British India until the early 1900s. Then the British government built New Delhi as its headquarters to get away from Calcutta's unpredictable and unruly freedom fighters.&nbsp;Many young female high school and college students were active protesters, couriers, and even soldiers in the movement to free India from British rule. I'm hoping to share this, as well as what the situation felt like for the British civil servants who believed that by enforcing strict laws in India, they would strengthen the empire and uplift Indian people as well.&nbsp;Whenever I start writing a book, I always know the location and themes I want to explore. What takes much longer is finding the right characters to keep me interested. After thinking for some time, the narrator seemed to whisper her name in my ear. She is a Bengali woman first introduced in 1930 as a poor but happy 10-year-old farmer's daughter nicknamed Pom. She goes through an incredible series of adventures, and by story's end, she's metamorphosed Kamala, a mature 27-year-old lady who's weathered a famine, war, childbirth and marriage...but is still struggling with how to recognize and share her past. It's a love-story, mother-daughter story, and political espionage--with recipes at the end.The book took me almost four years to write. By the time I was done, I realized that Kamala's journey from degradation to intellectual and social heights mirrored India's own route from a powerless colony to the world's largest democracy. I do hope you come along for the ride--let me know what you think.<b>Sujata Massey </b>is an Edgar and Anthony and Mary Higgins Clark Award nominee and winner of the Agatha and the Macavity Award for her ten Rei Shimura mystery novels set in Japan.

One thousand soldiers and a Marine Corps guard of honor joined the local police in restraining the hundreds who stood in the chilly first light in hopes of catching a glimpse of the illustrious passenger. They wanted nothing more, wrote one observer, than &#x201c;to cheer the president and to wish him God-speed on his momentous voyage.&#x201d; At last, the flag-draped locomotive sputtered to a halt so that its central car&#x2014;named &#x201c;Ideal&#x201d;&#x2014;stopped before a red carpet leading to Pier 4. A battalion of the 13th United States Infantry surrounded the train.<br><br>The passengers remained on board until eight o&#x2019;clock, at which time President Woodrow Wilson and his second wife, Edith, stepped off the train, prompting a rousing rendition of &#x201c;The Star-Spangled Banner&#x201d; from an Army band. Brigadier General G. H. McManus, commander of the Port of Embarkation, stepped forward to welcome his Commander in Chief. In the last eighteen months, McManus&#x2019;s port had witnessed the deployment of two million &#x201c;doughboys&#x201d; (as American soldiers were called) who had gone off to fight &#x201c;the Hun&#x201d; and win the first truly global war in history. General John J. Pershing, who had led the American Expeditionary Force, had rallied his armies from the outset with the vow that they would be in &#x201c;Heaven, Hell or Hoboken&#x201d; by Christmas of 1917.<br><br>A year later than Pershing had promised, President Wilson tipped his hat and greeted the surrounding soldiers and sailors before proceeding through a huge shed, which was lined with three hundred Army Transport Service girls in khaki and infantrymen bearing fixed bayonets. Hundreds of flags, those of the United States and the Allied nations&#x2014;Great Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy most recognizable among them&#x2014;hung from the ceiling of this vast hall. Wilson walked beneath the glorious array and onto his home for the next ten days, the United States steamship <i>George Washington</i>. On December 4, 1917, that same ship had transported her first five thousand troops to fight in the war &#x201c;over there.&#x201d; Now the great vessel was about to convey President Wilson and his team of aides and experts on a voyage of peace to Europe&#x2014;not only to conclude what had been the greatest conflagration in the history of man but also to create a document that might guarantee that they had just fought &#x201c;the war to end all wars.&#x201d;<br><br>As the President and Mrs. Wilson ascended the gangplank, the naval band on board struck up &#x201c;Hail to the Chief,&#x201d; after which it reprised the National Anthem. Then the Wilsons settled into their flower-filled accommodations. The President&#x2019;s suite consisted of a green-curtained bedroom and bath and a large office, with a mahogany desk on which sat a white telephone for shipboard calls; attached to a wall was a wireless telephone by which the President could communicate with Washington or the <i>Pennsylvania</i>, the lead escort ship.

Starling, &#x201c;had been checked from bow to stern and from keel to masthead, and members of the Secret Service all over the United States had been busy investigating members of the crew. . . . There was not a fireman or cabin boy whose family and background had not been thoroughly looked into.&#x201d; The hopes of the world were on board, and everything was being done to ensure the safety of the transport.<br><br>At 10:15 the twin-stacked ship&#x2014;722 feet long and weighing twenty-five thousand tons&#x2014;backed into the Hudson River. Once its stern was sighted heading northward, all the vessels in the waters around the New York islands responded with bells and sirens and horns and whistles. Passengers on every craft jockeyed for rail position in order to wish Woodrow Wilson bon voyage.<br><br>Wearing a bearskin coat, the President, with his wife, joined Captain Edward McCauley, Jr., on the bridge. Wilson waved his hands and raised his hat to the crowds again and again in appreciation of the most spectacular send-off in New York history. It was difficult to imagine in that moment of purely joyful noise, with thousands of flags and handkerchiefs waving in his honor, that he was one of the most polarizing Presidents in the nation&#x2019;s history. As one of his earliest supporters, Oklahoma Senator Thomas Pryor Gore, once said: &#x201c;Wilson had no friends, only slaves and enemies.&#x201d;<br><br>British Parliamentarian Cecil Harmsworth would later observe that he did not know of &#x201c;any historic personage . . . who so strangely attracts and repels&#x201d; as Woodrow Wilson. This was possibly because&#x2014;as another Wilson acquaintance observed&#x2014;&#x201c;probably in the history of the whole world there has been no great man, of whom so much has been written, but of whom personally so little has been correctly known.&#x201d; Yet another, who, as a college student, had first encountered him, never lost sight of the personal paradox that was the man: &#x201c;Stern and impassive, yet emotional; calm and patient, yet quick-tempered and impulsive; forgetful of those who had served him, yet devoted to many who had rendered but minor service . . . precise and business-like, and yet, upon occasion, illogical without more reason than intuition itself.&#x201d;<br><br>Theodore Roosevelt, the greatest political personality of the day, took potshots at Wilson at every possible opportunity; and during the 1912 Presidential campaign&#x2014;which he lost to Wilson&#x2014;advisers urged Roosevelt to smear his opponent with the rumors of an extramarital affair with a mysterious woman known as &#x201c;Mrs. Peck.&#x201d; TR refused, fearing that would only give Wilson some allure&#x2014;as he looked like nothing more than &#x201c;an apothecary&#x2019;s clerk.&#x201d; In this matter, however, TR&#x2019;s political assessment was mistaken. For all the dour photographs of the very proper President, society doyenne Evalyn Walsh McLean insisted that the women of America found him extremely attractive, which made him the subject of much giddy Washington gossip. For his part, Wilson admitted his susceptibility &#x201c;to all feminine attractions,&#x201d; as &#x201c;girls of all degrees of beauty and grace have a charm for me which almost amounts to a spell.&#x201d; He was, by his own admission, extremely sexual, always aware of &#x201c;the riotous element in my blood.&#x201d; Beneath his stern ministerial appearance churned a turbulent emotional life.<br><br>In wooing his first wife, the ethereal Ellen Axson of Rome, Georgia, Wilson indulged in one of the most expansive love correspondences in history&#x2014;thousands of letters so passionate she said they kept her &#x201c;in an almost constant state of intoxication.&#x201d; Cultured, well-read, and a talented artist, she abandoned any professional aspirations in order to serve her husband and raise their three daughters. She enabled his ambitions&#x2014;all the way to the White House, in which she got to live only fourteen months before dying there. Bereft beyond words, he contemplated resignation.<br><br>But the war had just broken out in Europe, and what duty could not arouse in him, a friend did, by introducing him to a buxom, well-to-do, young Washington widow named Edith Bolling Galt. The President fell in love at first sight. Despite the political and practical difficulties of courting from the White House, the President romanced her, again through sheaves of letters and private meetings. Less than eighteen months after burying the first Mrs. Wilson, he married the second. She worshipped him. And from that day forward&#x2014;in health and unexpectedly grave sickness&#x2014;she almost never left his side. Unwittingly, she would later enter into a conspiracy that ran the government and which would result in an amendment to the Constitution to prevent such an occurrence from happening again. Throughout their marriage, she monitored a twitch in his lower left eyelid and a throbbing in his cheek.<br><br>Despite numerous chronic ailments&#x2014;and a bad cold as he boarded the ship&#x2014;sixty-one-year-old Woodrow Wilson appeared remarkably fit. He stood five feet ten and one-half inches and weighed a lean 170 pounds. Except for some youthful experimentation with mustaches and sideburns, he had always been clean-shaven, with strong cheekbones and a prominent chin; he had a fine straight nose, and ears large enough to make some look twice. His hair had thinned, but he always retained enough to cut close and part neatly on the left. Although his vision was weak&#x2014;one eye virtually useless&#x2014;his deep gray eyes were as understanding as they could be piercing. A pince-nez, which emphasized his erudition, became his trademark. That and a J-shaped jaw were all a caricaturist needed to conjure the man. He had a well-defined mouth, with full lips; and though the public mostly saw a solemn face, he had a toothy smile and a deep laugh, one generally reserved for intimate occasions. He told corny jokes, could not resist a pun, and always had a limerick at the ready&#x2014;the raciest of which was about &#x201c;an old monk from Siberia&#x201d; who &#x201c;eloped with the Mother Superior.&#x201d; He loved to sing, showing off his silvery second tenor voice. One adviser wrote, &#x201c;I never knew a man whose general appearance changed so much from hour to hour.&#x201d; His demeanor could change as well. &#x201c;He seems to do his best to offend rather than to please, and yet when one gets access to him, there is no more charming man in all the world than Woodrow Wilson.&#x201d;<br><br>More than the elegant profile and courtly mien contributed to Wilson&#x2019;s authoritative stature. Diplomat and historian George F. Kennan&#x2014;who closely observed public figures throughout most of his 101 years&#x2014;noted, &#x201c;No man in modern times, to my mind, ever better looked or acted the part of an American president.&#x201d;<br><br>Twenty-six men had preceded Woodrow Wilson to the White House. Each generally pursued one of three well-worn paths, and sometimes a combination thereof: the earliest presidents especially rose through the ranks of state legislatures until they leapt to the national level, either in Congress, the Cabinet, or the diplomatic corps; a handful earned their stripes on the battlefield, where their leadership and heroism transformed them into national figures; several graduated from statehouses to the White House. Woodrow Wilson, it is true, did serve as Governor of New Jersey&#x2014;but so briefly that it barely distracts from his having blazed a trail to the Presidency that is utterly unique. Quite simply, he enjoyed the most meteoric rise in American history, one with a most unlikely origin&#x2014;a college campus.<br><br>Woodrow Wilson loved his alma mater, Princeton, with religious zeal; and as a professor and then its president, he not only reformed a country club college into a top-tier university but also developed a pedagogical model that many of America&#x2019;s institutions of higher education would subsequently adopt. His efforts to alter Princeton&#x2019;s social structure, however, forced him to leave under a cloud and to consider a lesson he taught without fully grasping himself: &#x201c;If you want to make enemies, try to change something.&#x201d;<br><br>A career intellectual, he was the only President of the United States to have spent the majority of his life cloistered in academia. Like most of his predecessors, he studied the law; and he became the first President to earn a doctorate degree as well. As one of the nation&#x2019;s leading historians and first political scientists, he had written a dozen books and numerous articles and delivered countless lectures and speeches&#x2014;often on matters that reached into the realm of public affairs. While advocating educational reforms at Princeton, he had fought against the injustices of privilege wherever he could, championing meritocracy. Wilson distinguished himself as a public thinker.<br><br>But he had spent most of his life in private frustration, half-fulfilled, as he long harbored hidden aspirations he seldom voiced. His intellectual vigor masked a lifelong ambition to hold high political office&#x2014;to make history more than teach it. With Princeton&#x2019;s trustees thwarting his educational revolution, the impeccable Wilson accepted an offer to run for Governor of New Jersey. In so doing, he disabled the &#x201c;machine&#x201d; of the most corrupt state in the Union, defying the very bosses who had selected him to be their puppet. Wilson would later say he left Princeton for government service in order to get out of politics.<br><br>No American statesman ever had a shorter second act. As late as October 1910, at age fifty-three and never having run for public office, Woodrow Wilson headed a small, all-male college in a quiet town in New Jersey; in November 1912, he was elected President of the United States. He swiftly went from near obscurity to global prominence, becoming the most powerful man on earth. He would contend that it had all been choreographed&#x2014;not by himself, but by Himself.<br><br>&#x201c;No man in supreme power in any nation&#x2019;s life,&#x201d; wrote the University of Virginia&#x2019;s president Edwin A. Alderman, &#x201d;. . . was so profoundly penetrated by the Christian faith. He was sturdily and mystically Christian.&#x201d; Born in a church manse, the son and grandson of Presbyterian ministers, Wilson did not often preach Christianity from his bully pulpit, but he ardently practiced it, infusing all his decisions with a piety and morality that were never lost on his constituents. His devotion was genuine. Twice a day he genuflected in prayer, he said grace before each meal, and he read a chapter of the Bible every night. He referred to Sunday as the Sabbath. And he appointed the first Jew to the Supreme Court.<br><br>Beholden to nobody, he had risen to his position through brainpower. Wedding the complexity of his intellect with the simplicity of his faith, placing principles before politics, he followed his conscience, never first checking public opinion. He spoke only for himself, and he found much of the nation agreeing with what he had to say. Arguably the least experienced person to hold the highest political office in the land, he was the Presidency&#x2019;s most accomplished student of American history and politics. As such, he proved to be an unexpectedly evolved political animal, with a tough hide and sharp claws. In 1912 he entered one of the most thrilling races in the nation&#x2019;s history and beat two worthy adversaries&#x2014;a Republican incumbent, William Howard Taft, and the even more popular third-party candidate, Theodore Roosevelt, the Progressive from the Bull Moose Party.<br><br>Ambrose Bierce had recently defined politics in his <i>Devil&#x2019;s Dictionary</i> as &#x201c;the conduct of public affairs for private advantage.&#x201d; But Wilson defied such thinking. In the middle of a period of great economic inequality&#x2014; when the nation&#x2019;s richest 1 percent owned half its wealth&#x2014;he unveiled his Presidential program. His &#x201c;New Freedom&#x201d; worked honestly to protect the less favored 99 percent of his countrymen. In order to actualize his slate of progressive reforms, he brought a bold new approach to his office, one in which the executive and legislative branc...</p><h2>A Lion Among Men: Volume Three in The Wicked Years (Wicked Years, 3)</h2><p><p>Return to a darker Oz with Gregory Maguire.

Before her final hour, an enigmatic figure known as Brrr&#x2014;the Cowardly Lion&#x2014;arrives searching for information about Elphaba Thropp, the Wicked Witch of the West.

Maguire has lectured on art, literature, and culture both at home and abroad. He lives with his family near Boston, Massachusetts.</p> <p> <strong> A Letter from Gregory Maguire</strong></p><p> </p><p>Dear friends, </p> <p>Here it is: volume three in my series coming to be known as The Wicked Years. I have had such warm reader response to <i>Wicked</i> and <i>Son of a Witch</i>, both initially and in the years since, that the thought of adding to the series made me feel--well, cowardly. I resisted for a while. But courage comes to those who wait, sometimes: so here is volume three. </p> <p><i>A Lion Among Men</i> follows the peripatetic career of the Cowardly Lion. First seen in <i>Wicked</i> as a lion cub culled from his pride for the purpose of laboratory experimentation, the Lion (known as Brrr) makes his name in that little Matter of Dorothy about which all of Oz is still talking. But one doesn&#x2019;t necessarily become lion-hearted by going after public approval, by racking up those medals and titles and golden statuettes at award ceremonies. </p> <p>Tarnished with scandal of every stripe, Brrr is loathed by the Animals who believe he betrayed them in helping Dorothy do in the Witch. He fares no better trying to live as a lion among men. When civil war breaks out in Oz, Brrr is caught in the line of fire as he interviews the mysterious old oracle, Yackle, about the sources of Elphaba&#x2019;s power. He must choose how much approval he can live without. A bit player all his life, he may yet be the linchpin on which the prosecution of the war rests. </p> <p>When I travel abroad (and the continuing success of the musical <i>Wicked</i> has brought me to countries where it is now playing), I am sometimes met with bemusement about the origins of the material--a children&#x2019;s book made famous by a musical film for children!--how can this serve as a proper metaphor for a meditation about predestination and free will, about political opportunism and personal valor? </p> <p>Maybe, I say, you have to be an American to see that a vaudeville comedian in baggy lion-pajamas, as Burt Lahr seemed to me, has just as much right to inspire a story about the education of a hero as any Siegfried or Lancelot or Joan of Arc. </p> <p>And if they reply, <i>You have some nerve!</i>I answer <i>Thank you. I hope so. </i></p> <p>And I do thank you for your lion-hearted confidence in these wicked novels. </p> <p>-- Gregory </p><p>While civil war looms in Oz, Brrr&#x2014;the Cowardly Lion&#x2014;surrenders the story of his life to a tetchy oracle named Yackle.

He was standing up on the pedals and slogging upward. He considered ignoring it, and then had a vivid image of his mum in hospital. And following that, he had a slightly stomach-�turning thought that it might be Michelle. Which was just as irrational as every other time he&#x2019;d believed it in the last eight months, but he thought it anyway.<br><br>He braked with gritted teeth and stopped his grinding climb. He caught his shin on one of the pedals as he jumped down, and was savage by the time he&#x2019;d rooted his phone out and seen DS Lightman&#x2019;s extension flashing on the screen.<br><br>&#x201c;Ben?&#x201d; he said, and then moved the phone away from his mouth to mask his heavy breathing.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, Chief.&#x201d; Lightman didn&#x2019;t sound it. Never really sounded anything. Michelle had liked to call him Barbie. Exquisitely pretty and emotionless. A lot smarter than Barbie, though, Jonah knew. &#x201c;Call from DCS Wilkinson.

It was a slog away, but he wanted the slog. His legs were crying out for it. He squeezed the drop handles of his bike with his free hand and felt the sweat on his palm. He hadn&#x2019;t spent enough time doing this recently.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d; he asked, not bothering to hide his irritation.<br><br>&#x201c;Brinken Wood.&#x201d;<br><br>There was another silence, but this one wasn&#x2019;t deliberate.

It gave her a slightly sick feeling. She hadn&#x2019;t really been able to afford it in the first place. She&#x2019;d bought three others in her first two weeks as a DC, having previously owned only jeans, tank tops, and sweaters, and a few dresses for going out. Suits were bloody expensive, and she resented the money she could have been spending on her unreliable car.

She wondered if she could get her mum to take a look at it, if she managed to make it to her mum&#x2019;s anytime soon. A potential homicide might mean working through the weekend. Late nights and living off caffeine while they caught the killer. The thought made her smile.<br><br>She let herself into CID and saw Lightman&#x2019;s head bent over his screen. She wondered how long he&#x2019;d been here, and whether he did anything else with his life. Whether there were a Lightman wife and kids that he hadn&#x2019;t yet mentioned. He somehow had the look of an unfaithful husband about him. Too pretty, and too closed-�off. Unless that was more her own recent experience warping her expectations.<br><br>Lightman caught sight of her and gave a small smile. &#x201c;I got hold of the chief. He&#x2019;s going to need picking up and taking to the crime scene.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On it,&#x201d; Hanson answered immediately. &#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Godshill,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s on his bike.&#x201d;<br><br>Hanson nodded. She pretended she knew the place well, and that she wasn&#x2019;t about to punch it into her GPS. Two weeks into the job and she basically knew the route from home to the station and the supermarket, and from there to the dockside, where they&#x2019;d been looking at some potential fraud. She missed the certainty of zooming around Birmingham, where she&#x2019;d grown up and then worked as a constable for two years. Though she had to admit that the New Forest was a lot prettier.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need this,&#x201d; Lightman said, and lifted a dark-�gray kit bag from the floor. &#x201c;And despite the time constraints, I&#x2019;d take him a coffee. He&#x2019;s not going to be that happy at having his day off interrupted.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;OK. Just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a filter coffee? Not a latte or something?&#x201d;<br><br>Lightman laughed. &#x201c;God, no. Have you not had one of his rants on coffee menus yet?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, but I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;ll be great.&#x201d; She put the kit bag onto her shoulder. &#x201c;OK. Anything else? Do you know what it&#x2019;s about yet?&#x201d;<br><br>Lightman shook his head. &#x201c;Local sergeant will hand over to the chief at the scene. You&#x2019;ll both get a rundown, though if it&#x2019;s not recent, there won&#x2019;t be much so far.&#x201d;<br><br>Hanson nodded, and tried not to smile. You shouldn&#x2019;t smile at news of a murder, even if it had been ages ago. But the truth was, she was delighted.<br><br>Hanson was wound up like it was exam-�results day. She gabbled at Jonah about the kit bag and coffee, and then without pausing for breath asked about the remains. Jonah found it somewhere between sweet and irritating.<br><br>&#x201c;Ben said they might not be recent,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d wait until forensics gave an opinion,&#x201d; he replied, taking a long gulp of coffee. &#x201c;Most people&#x2014;�including me&#x2014;�don&#x2019;t have a clue what age bones are.&#x201d;<br><br>Having sweated and chilled, he was cold even in the suit he had tugged on in the public toilets at Godshill. Cold, and drifting around his own thoughts of thirty years ago. He had to interrupt her to ask her to turn the heater on. The Fiat veered while she turned the dial, and then steadied.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just grateful you&#x2019;re driving,&#x201d; he said with a slight smile. &#x201c;The coffee was a good call, by the way. You&#x2019;ve given me at least a couple of hours of not being in a really bad mood.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm. A couple of hours. So I&#x2019;ve either got to find you a Starbucks before then or get out of the way?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pretty much,&#x201d; Jonah agreed.<br><br>Brinken Wood was suddenly on them. There was a cluster of squad cars and uniforms in the shingle car park. He found it impossible not to remember this place as it had been back then. The car park had all been bark and mud, but it had been just as overrun by police. The haircuts different; the faces somehow the same.<br><br>Jonah levered himself out of the car once they&#x2019;d pulled up, taking the coffee cup with him. He felt like he&#x2019;d gone back in time. So many months had been spent here, searching endlessly.<br><br>He approached the sergeant. &#x201c;DCI Sheens. This is DC Hanson.&#x201d;<br><br>Hanson had been the same rank as the sergeant two weeks ago. But to train as a detective, you had to take what amounted to a demotion, and become a detective constable. He remembered not being sure who was more important when it had happened to him, and wondered if Hanson felt the same.<br><br>There was sweat along the sergeant&#x2019;s hairline. His eyes were over-�wide and his smile brief and agitated. His police constable, a stocky twentysomething, seemed calmer.<br><br>Jonah addressed his question somewhere between the two of them: &#x201c;Who found the remains?&#x201d;<br><br>The sergeant answered. &#x201c;A GP out camping with his family. Well, his daughter, but he called it in.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How old&#x2019;s the daughter?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nine,&#x201d; the constable said. &#x201c;Seems fine, though. It&#x2019;s the father who&#x2019;s taking it hard.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re still here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve kept them at their campsite. It&#x2019;s not within view of the remains.&#x201d;<br><br>Jonah nodded, and let the sergeant lead the way, though he knew where he was going. It was where seven kids had bedded down thirty years ago, but only six of them had got up in the morning.<br><br>Dr. Martin Miller was sitting apart from his family. The doctor&#x2019;s wife was watching the boy play on an iPad. The girl was kicking up dust around the edge of the camp.<br><br>It was the mother Jonah approached.<br><br>&#x201c;DCI Sheens.&#x201d; He smiled at her. He&#x2019;d had to learn how to smile when his mind was full of complicated, dark thoughts like crazed glass between him and the world. &#x201c;Would you mind if I talk to your daughter for a few minutes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jessie!&#x201d; It was a call from the father. His voice was high-�pitched and irritable. &#x201c;Stop kicking like that. You&#x2019;re making a mess.&#x201d;<br><br>The girl was halfway upset and halfway rebellious. She scuffed over to her mother and Jonah, sat down quickly, and looked up at him, her knees up near her chin.<br><br>The mother slid an arm round her in a brief hug. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t mind talking to the police, do you, Jessie?&#x201d; she asked her daughter.<br><br>Jessie shook her head.<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t need to ask much,&#x201d; Jonah said steadily. &#x201c;Just a few details about what you found.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t know anything,&#x201d; her slightly older brother interrupted scathingly. The disdain of older siblings had always seemed uniquely intense to Jonah.<br><br>He glanced over at the boy, who was now watching them both a little sullenly. He thought about asking him to move away, but decided to let him be.<br><br>He crouched close to Jessie. &#x201c;So, a few questions for you.&#x201d;<br><br>The girl gave him another wary look, and then her gaze wandered away and she picked up a pebble, threw it off to the side, repeated it with another.<br><br>&#x201c;Jessie, for goodness&#x2019; sake!&#x201d; The father again. Much closer. &#x201c;Stop throwing things, and look at the policeman when he&#x2019;s talking to you. This is important.&#x201d;<br><br>Jonah tried to smile up at the doctor. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s OK, don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jessie!&#x201d;<br><br>Jonah might as well not have spoken.<br><br>The girl gave her father a truculent look, and then did her best to look up at Jonah through her straight brown fringe. Jonah tried not to become irritated at the father&#x2019;s interruptions, which had nothing to do with helping the police, he thought, and everything to do with control.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you an inspector?&#x201d; Jessie asked quietly.<br><br>Jonah grinned. &#x201c;I am. Detective chief inspector, in fact.&#x201d;<br><br>Jessie&#x2019;s eyes were still a little wary. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re in charge?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She seemed happy enough with that, so he went on. &#x201c;Could you tell me what you were doing when you found the bones?&#x201d;<br><br>Jessie glanced at her father, and then said quietly, &#x201c;Hiding.&#x201d;<br><br>Jonah saw the mother grimace, but she didn&#x2019;t try to deny it.<br><br>&#x201c;Hiding can be fun,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That hollow under the tree. That was already there? You didn&#x2019;t have to dig it?&#x201d;<br><br>Jessie shook her head. &#x201c;I just got in and sat down. There was something poking me, so I pulled it out.&#x201d;<br><br>Jonah nodded. &#x201c;Naturally. And it came out easily?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. I thought&#x2014;�I thought it was a root, and then maybe a plant because I grabbed a handful. But then I realized it was a finger.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well done,&#x201d; he said, nodding. &#x201c;Not everybody would have realized.&#x201d;<br><br>Jessie nodded, gave a small smile, and stood up. Her mother pulled her into a brief hug.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like them not to talk to their school friends about this for a few days,&#x201d; Jonah said to Mrs. Miller, once she&#x2019;d let go of her daughter.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s OK, they&#x2019;re not seeing any for a few weeks. We thought we&#x2019;d carry on the trip, but somewhere else.&#x201d;<br><br>Privately educated kids, he realized. They were already on vacation, a good month before the state schools broke up.<br><br>&#x201c;Good. It would be better if this wasn&#x2019;t talked about just yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br><br>He heard Dr. Miller&#x2019;s footsteps.<br><br>&#x201c;Are we done? It&#x2019;s a beautiful day and I don&#x2019;t think we have much to add.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, we&#x2019;re all done. Thanks for your patience.&#x201d;<br><br>Jonah stood, and the doctor was already giving his children orders to get packed up.<br><br>He hurried them over to the tent, and Jonah found himself watching until Mrs. Miller rose and began to pick up a few half-�eaten packs of raisins and a cup.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry your vacation got interrupted,&#x201d; he said.</p><h2>Mind&#39;s Eye, The: A Guide to Writing Poetry</h2><p><p> <i>The Mind&#x2019;s Eye</i>, written by a published poet, focuses on imagery and sound and has the added benefit of being concise, inexpensive, and handy.&nbsp; Contemporary poetry as well as traditional form is discussed, with an emphasis on contemporary poets &#x2014; more than ninety of them &#x2014; and three student poets.&nbsp; Chapters deal with difficult topics such as racism, war, mortality, gender, and more.</p></p><p><b><p>Focusing on imagery and sound, this new book on the teaching of poetry writing is concise, practical, and inexpensive and its the only poetry writing textbook designed specifically for a college term.

Now, twenty-five years after its first publication, this groundbreaking classic is back in a crucial and updated third edition. With new and extended chapters, D&#x2019;Emilio and Freedman give us an even deeper understanding of how sexuality has dramatically influenced politics and culture throughout our history and into the present.&nbsp;Hailed by critics for its comprehensive approach and noted by the US Supreme Court in the landmark <i>Lawrence v.

With lively prose and the perfect mix of resonant historical cases, David Grazian investigates the role of media and popular culture in everyday life. Now with a new chapter on the globalization of pop culture, <em>Mix It Up</em> explores how the media industry is organized; the increasingly blurry relationship between cultural consumption and production; and the social significance of leisure activities.</p><p>David Grazian is an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where he teaches courses on popular culture and mass media, urban sociology, and ethnographic methods. Over 400 students take his sociology of popular culture and mass media course each semester, making it one of the largest courses at the University of Pennsylvania. In his research he uses ethnographic and other qualitative methods to study the production and consumption of commercial entertainment in cities. His books include Blue Chicago: The Search for Authenticity in Urban Blues Clubs (2003), On the Make: The Hustle of Urban Nightlife (2008), and American Zoo: A Sociological Safari (2015).&#x201c;In <em>Mix It Up</em>, David Grazian pulls off the hat trick, three big scores in one book. He combines an encyclopedic knowledge of popular culture, a deep acquaintance with and understanding of sociological ideas, and a relaxed yet penetrating language to pass on what he knows to his lucky readers.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Howard S. Becker, author of <i>Art Worlds</i> and <i>Telling About Society</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is the book I&#x2019;ve been waiting for. Grazian deftly uses the lens of popular culture to introduce major themes in the sociology of culture, and the sociology of culture to illuminate key features of popular culture. <em>Mix It Up</em> is accessible but never dumbed-down, current while also historically rich, at once wide-ranging and shrewdly organized. Grazian&#x2019;s text is the best I&#x2019;ve encountered for undergraduate courses in sociology of culture and pop-culture studies.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joshua Gamson, University of San Francisco; Author of <i>Claims to Fame</i>, <i>Freaks Talk Back</i>, and <i>The Fabulous Sylvester</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;From Bollywood to Botox, Shakespeare to Second Life, David Grazian uses a wide array of cutting-edge examples to illustrate how popular culture serves as a window into sociological thinking. His conversational writing style takes the reader through a fun and informative journey through the essential topics concerning media culture today.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Karen Sternheimer, University of Southern California; Editor of the <i>Everyday Sociology Blog</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Part fierce intellectual, part exuberant fan, Grazian delves beneath the noisy skim of pop culture to find patterns, meanings, and rituals. <em>Mix It Up</em> uses the power of the sociological imagination to pry the shiny lid off of everyday objects and artifacts, revealing social processes, political ideologies, and cultural mechanisms whirring away underneath. Written with humor and wit, this is a smart and lively book, interesting and accessible to students and useful and inspiring for instructors.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Matt Wray, Temple University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;David Grazian&#x2019;s book is a godsend for sociologists entrusted with teaching popular culture classes. It is an engaging, scholarly rigorous book. I would certainly recommend it to a colleague.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Omar Lizardo, University of Notre Dame</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Mix It Up</em> deftly unscrambles the diverse and fast changing world of mass media-made popular culture and its place in American society.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Richard A.

SMITH, III, is an Associate Professor in the School of Mass Communications, Virginia Commonwealth University.Until now, a scholarly edition of Richard M. Weaver's writings has been lacking. Edited by Virginia Commonwealth University professor Ted J. Smith III, this splendid volume from Liberty Fund, also the publisher of <i><b>The Southern Essays of Richard M. Weaver </b></i>(1987), goes far in rectifying that deficiency. Smith presents all of Weaver's published shorter writings (except for those in <b><i>The Southern Essays</i>, </b> and one early essay, apparently lost), plus eleven previously unpublished essays and speeches which were in nearly final form when Weaver died. Thus "all of Weaver's published and significant unpublished writings except his composition texts are now available in book form". . . .Handsomely crafted and superbly edited, <b><i>In Defense of Tradition </i></b>is an invaluable contribution to scholarship and to the study and understanding of one of conservatism's greatest minds.

His presidency is the hinge on which American history pivots, the time when the young republic collapsed of its own contradictions and a new birth of freedom, sanctified by blood, created the United States we know today. His story has been told many times, but never by a man who himself sought the office of president and contemplated the awesome responsibilities that come with it. </p><p>George S. McGovern&#x2015;a Midwesterner, former U.S. senator, presidential candidate, veteran, and historian by training&#x2015;offers his unique insight into our sixteenth president. He shows how Lincoln sometimes went astray, particularly in his restrictions on civil liberties, but also how he adjusted his sights and transformed the Civil War from a political dispute to a moral crusade. McGovern's account reminds us why we hold Lincoln in such esteem and why he remains the standard by which all of his successors are measured.</p></p><p><b>George S. McGovern</b> represented South Dakota in the United States Senate from 1963 to 1981 and was the Democratic nominee for president in 1972. He was a decorated bomber pilot in World War II, after which he earned his Ph.D. in American history and government at Northwestern University. He was also a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.<p>Prologue</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The Greatness of Lincoln</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Two hundred years ago Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin in the Kentucky wilderness. From crude, disadvantaged beginnings he somehow recognized significant capabilities within himself and nurtured a determination to succeed. He rose improbably and unevenly, becoming a clerk, surveyor, businessman, lawyer, legislator, family man, statesman, and national political figure. From the heights of presidential power and privilege he led the country through its most terrible trial of civil war. In his resolve he maintained that no state or sectional interest could break apart a Union formed in perpetuity. In his genius he transformed the bloody struggle into a second American Revolution, a "new birth of freedom" that would finally allow fulfillment of the national promise of equality for all Americans, regardless of color. In life he was respected and ridiculed, beloved and hated; in death he was martyred. Lincoln is revered as our greatest president, but he is certainly more than that. He is an unparalleled national treasure, a legend that best represents the democratic ideal. Every generation looks to Lincoln for strength, inspiration, and wisdom. We want to know everything about him, and we wish we could be more like him. Why do we admire him so?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Abraham Lincoln was a self-made man who rose above the circumstances of his birth. The son of antislavery Baptists, reared in the backwoods of Kentucky and Indiana, he led an unpretentious and obscure early life. He knew no privilege or advantage, and was taught no life lessons except the necessity of unrelenting work. His formal education totaled just one year, but from that brief experience in the schoolroom he learned that knowledge, no matter how acquired, would be the key to improving his station in life. He never stopped reading, absorbing, analyzing, and through dogged determination he grew in wisdom and stature.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>His unquenchable ambition came from within. Certainly he longed to remove himself from his father`s world of drudgery and near-poverty. Perhaps he was inspired by his mother`s, and then his stepmother`s, gentle insistence that he could improve himself through reading, learning, and mental activity. Perhaps, too, he carried with him a mea sure of New En gland Yankeemahastyle initiative and character and recognition of individual responsibility. What ever the source, Lincoln was, in the words of one biographer, "the most ambitious man in the world."1</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>He learned from all of his failures&#x2014;and there were many. Dissatisfied with farm life, he left his father`s home for good at age twenty-one, settling in New Salem, Illinois, a tiny village that was, like him, rough, undeveloped, and facing an uncertain future. He purchased an interest in two small general stores, but chose unreliable and perhaps dishonest men for partners who left him with a staggering debt that took him years to pay. At various times he worked as a field hand, postal clerk, blacksmith, and surveyor, positions that at best brought temporary satisfaction but left him feeling unfulfilled. He was gawky, shambling, and homespun. He lacked confidence, particularly around women, and Ann Rutledge, alleged by some to be his first true love, died of typhoid in 1835. In 1832 he lost the first political contest he entered, for the Illinois state legislature.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>But Lincoln would not resign himself to failure and loss; instead he learned from each experience and carried on. People, he found, liked him despite his rough exterior&#x2014;or perhaps because of it. They laughed at his jokes and liked to be around him. He inspired trust. He paid his debts. He ran again for the state legislature in 1834 and was elected, and then reelected four more times. He threw himself into the study of law, spending nearly every waking moment reading and analyzing the rules of pleading and practice, and became an attorney in 1836. He earned a reputation for honesty and sincerity, and he parlayed his standing in legal circles and his political connections into election to Congress in 1846. He shook off his broken heart over the death of Ann Rutledge and in 1842 married the vivacious Mary Todd, perhaps the most enchanting young lady in Illinois, who would fuel his driving ambition.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>During most of his life Lincoln suffered from recurring bouts of emotional depression or what he and his associates called "melancholy." This is a malady that can result in agonizing, even paralyzing, despair. That Lincoln was able to contain, if not conquer, this dread affliction is a huge tribute to his strength and character.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Perhaps the best account of his depression is by the historian Joshua Wolf Shenk, who wrote of Lincoln:</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>He told jokes and stories at odd times&#x2014;he needed the laughs, he said, for his survival. He often wept in public and recited maudlin poetry. As a young man he talked of suicide, and as he grew older, he said he saw the world as hard and grim, full of misery, made that way by fates and forces of God. "No element of Mr. Lincoln`s character," declared his colleague Henry Whitney, "was so marked, obvious and ingrained as his mysterious and profound melancholy." His law partner William Herndon said, "His melancholy dripped from him as he walked."2</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In 1841, at the age of thirty-two, Lincoln wrote: "I am now the most miserable man living." During his days in the Illinois legislature, his friend Robert L. Wilson said that while Lincoln was often humorous and fun-loving, he once took Wilson aside to confess that he was a victim of depression so painful that he didn`t dare carry a knife lest he commit suicide. Lincoln suffered grievously. It is Shenk`s view that this suffering refined and strengthened Lincoln`s greatness.3</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Lincoln`s obvious sadness drew his associates and many citizens to him. Given his determination to control his emotional life and to move from challenge to challenge and from battle to battle, it may well be that he converted an apparent handicap into a political asset. His sad countenance, reflecting his internal depression, doubtless touched the hearts of many voters who came to love and admire the tall, lean, sad-faced man from Illinois.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Various factors could have contributed to Lincoln`s depression: heredity, deaths in the family, business failures, election defeats, even bad weather. His law partner William Herndon reported that Lincoln believed he might have contracted syphilis in 1835 or 1836. If so, this might account for some of his anxiety about marriage. Many of the men in Lincoln`s time had some kind of sexually transmitted disease or feared that they did.4</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Despite his struggle with depression, Lincoln took advantage of his opportunities. Although he served but a single term in Congress&#x2014;he took the unpopular stand of opposing the war with Mexico&#x2014;he reentered the political arena in 1858, challenging the feisty Stephen Douglas for the U.S. Senate. He lost the election but won the admiration of many who heard him speak passionately about the country and its future, and he most assuredly caught the attention of national political leaders. Riding a wave of good publicity after a speech at New York`s Cooper Union in February 1860, where he declared that "right makes might," he sensed that the time was his. His name was bandied about for the Republican presidential nomination while his Democratic opponents bickered, hopelessly splitting their party along North-South lines. Lincoln`s Republican adversaries for the nomination were not as talented and well positioned, and he became the ideal compromise candidate at the party`s convention. A few months later, he was elected president of a country that seemed b</p></p><h2>The Spiritual Exercises Reclaimed: Uncovering Liberating Possibilities for Women</h2><p>The Spiritual Exercises often seem irrelevant or even destructive to many women's spirituality. This groundbreaking work reclaims the heart of the Exercises by examining them through the lens of women's experience--both women of the past to understand their presence during the formative years of the Exercises, but primarily women of the present. In doing so the authors have rediscovered the riches of this classic for both genders. <p>The book first reviews the major traditional interpretations of the Exercises and gives a historical view of the women in Ignatius' life and their role in the Exercises. The text itself is examined--how it is entered, its worldview, and its recommended forms of prayer. The four weeks of the Exercises are broken into the problems and possibilities of each; suggestions for each are also given for spiritual and retreat directors. The Exercises are finally examined for those aspects that support moving outward on one's mission. The book ends with a morality play called AnyWoman that gives a dramatic spin to the whole process. </p><p>The first of its kind, this is deeply meaningful reading for both men and women, particularly those making the Exercises, those giving them, and anyone who has attempted the Exercises but resisted the images, metaphors, or interpretations. Retreat and spiritual directors, other educators, retreatants and directees will also want a copy.</p></p><p>Elizabeth Liebert is Professor of Spiritual Life at San Francisco Theological Seminary in San Anselmo, California.

Henry Morris brings to this commentary his unashamed adherence to the plain, literal translation and teaching of the Word of God. His exploration and interpretation offer details of Solomon's heritage merely touched upon by other authors.</p> <p>Solomon surpassed all the kings in wisdom and prosperity. He was highly honored by God with his appointment to rebuild the Temple. How could such a devoted man of God also build shrines to the pagan gods of his many wives? We have much to learn about God and man by exploring Solomon's life and Old Testament books of the Bible. Acclaimed author Henry Morris answers many questions in this biblical exposition including the following:</p> <ul> <li>Why would a man of greatest wisdom think he needed seven hundred wives and 300 concubines? Why didn't they give him any children?</li> <li>How could a man of wisdom and blessing and great love of the Lord have his heart partially turned away from God by pagan wives?</li> <li>How could God use an apparently apostate king like Solomon to write 3 books of the Bible?</li> <li>Why did Ezra deliberately omit all the negative aspects of Solomon's birth, life, and career, only recording the positive items?</li> </ul> <p>Some say Solomon spoke more wisely than he lived. In <em>The Remarkable Wisdom of Solomon</em>, we witness God's power at work in Solomon to accomplish exceedingly and abundantly more than we can ask or think (Ephesians 3:20). Yet Solomon's biography also reveals a slow drift from wholehearted devotion to God and the tragic consequences for the next generations. Careful study of Solomon's life and words of wisdom are imperative for the blessed life of earnest believers.</p></p><p><p>A prolific and influential scholar known to believers and skeptics alike as "the father of modern creation science," Dr. Henry M. Morris truly was a man of science and a staunch man of God. He was even said to have set the terms of debate about evolution for the second half of the 20th century by one Pulitzer Prize-winning academician. Dr. Morris began his serious study of the Bible in the 1930s and authoring books in the 1940s, but it was his landmark work, co-authored with Dr. John Whitcomb, titled <em>The Genesis Flood</em> in 1961 that influenced generations to begin discovering the fallacies of evolution and the biblical truth of creation.</p> <p>With over 60 books, founding and leading the Institute for Creation Research (ICR), Dr. Morris' death in 2006 was a profound loss to millions.</p> <p>Dr. Morris created a thriving legacy that continues to equip many Christians to be able to defend the accuracy and authority of Scripture today. The new <em>Henry Morris Study Bible</em> and other resources that he developed remain essential sources of knowledge and understanding for believers.</p><p>Dr. Morris uncovers vivid details tucked away in the proverbs of Solomon that add context to relevant, often stand-alone instructions for living well. There are rich gems of the truth to be mined in his commentary of the wisdom literature of the Bible. <em>The Remarkable Wisdom of Solomon</em>, along with Dr. Morris' many other books grows out of his faithful interpretation of the truth of God's word. It is an important book for earnest Christians, lay and clergy.</p> --Dr. Art Peters</p><h2>Exploring The New Testament World An Illustrated Guide To The World Of Jesus And The First Christians</h2><p><p>The timeless message of the New Testament applies to people of every culture and generation. Yet there is great value in understanding the world in which that message was first revealed - its social manners, politics, religious customs, and culture. Exploring the New Testament World, written by classics and Bible scholar Dr. Albert A. Bell, Jr., illuminates the living context of the New Testament, immersing its readers in the intriguing world of Jesus and the early church.</p> <p>An authority on ancient Greek and Roman language, culture, and history, Dr. Bell writes in a readable style that is accessible and enjoyable to any reader - an uncommon accomplishment among New Testament scholars today. Surveying Jewish factions of the era, the social and political structure of the Roman Empire, and the philosophies and religions that surrounded the early church, Dr. Bell helps his readers learn to think like first-century Jews, Greeks, and Romans, illuminating puzzling New Testament passages for clear understanding. Comprehensive Scripture and Subject Indexes make this volume even more useful as a "manners and customs" Bible companion.</p> <p>This authoritative guide receives high praise from college professors and Sunday school teachers alike, proving its appeal to both popular and academic audiences. A "must-have" reference for every pastor and an indispensable resource to any Bible reader.</p></p><p></p><h2>LUCY NEGRO, REDUX: The Bard, a Book, and a Ballet</h2><p>"Part lyrical narrative, part bluesy riff, part schoolyard chant and part holy incantation" &#x2015; New York Times<br><br>Lucy Negro, Redux, uses the lens of Shakespeare's "Dark Lady" sonnets to explore the way questions about and desire for the black female body have evolved over time, from Elizabethan England to the Jim Crow South to the present day. Equally interested in the sensual and the serious, the erotic and the academic, this collection experiments with form, dialect, persona, and voice. Ultimately a hybrid document, Lucy Negro Redux harnesses blues poetry, deconstructed sonnets, historical documents and lyric essays to tell the challenging, many-faceted story of the Dark Lady, her Shakespeare, and their real and imagined milieu. Inspired by the book, The Nashville Ballet will premiere &#x201c;Lucy Negro Redux,&#x201d; an original ballet conceived and choreographed by Artistic Director &amp; CEO, Paul Vasterling, in February 2019 at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center. A collaboration of music, poetry and choreography, this contemporary ballet based on Caroline Randall Williams&#x2019; book of poetry of the same name is unique in process, content and format. The project uses dance and music to execute the author&#x2019;s exploration of more than 160 of Shakespeare&#x2019;s sonnets, and her arrival to a thesis that the &#x201c;Dark Lady&#x201d; and the &#x201c;Fair Youth&#x201d;&#x2015;the subjects and inspiration of these sonnets&#x2015;were undoubtedly a black woman and a young man lover. Ultimately, in experiencing Lucy through themes of love, otherness and equality, the narrator, and thus the audience, finds a powerful female voice.</p><p>Caroline Randall Williams is a multi-genre writer and and educator in Nashville Tennessee.

The idea for this book came from Dr. Elizabeth Peet, Dr. Sternberg's sign language teacher at Gallaudet University (for the deaf), in Washington, DC. Dr. Sternberg kept Dr. Peet's ideas and methods, but expanded the work greatly. Early work on the project received a federal grant from the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare to New York University, the sponsoring institution. A graduate of the City College of New York, American University, and New York University, Dr. Sternberg has enjoyed a distinguished career as a teacher at Gallaudet, New York, Hofstra, and Adelphi Universities. HE is currently chairman of the board of trustees of Lexington School for the Deaf and Lexington Center for the Deaf. He is the author of four ASL dictionaries and a Codies Award-winning CD-ROM, all published by HarperCollins. He also received Emmy and Peabody nominations for his ASL series by the NBC network, "Speaking With Your Hands," as well as medals at various international film and television festivals.<p><b>Explanatory Notes</b></p><b><br></b><p><b>Sign Rationale</b></p><p>This term, admittedly imprecise semantically, refers to the explanatory material in parentheses which follows the part of speech. This material is an attempt to offer a mnemonic cue to the sign as described verbally. It is a device to aid the user of the dictionary to remember how a sign is formed. </p><p><b>Verbal Description</b></p><p>The sign and its formation are described verbally. Such terms as "S" hand, "U' position, "both 'B' hands," refer to the positions of the hand or hands as they are depicted in the American Manual Alphabet on page xxiii. </p><p>Terms such as "counterclockwise," "clockwise," refer to movement from the signer's orientation. Care should be taken not to become confused by illustrations which appear at first glance to contradict a verbal description. In all cases the verbal description should be the one of choice, with the illustration reinforcing it. The reader should place himself or herself mentally in the position of the signer, <i>i.e.,</i> the illustration, in order to assume the correct orientation for signing an English gloss word. </p><p><b>Sign Synonyms</b></p><p>Sign synonyms are other glosses for which the same sign is used. They are found at the end of the verbal description, following the italicized <i>Cf</i> and are given in SMALL CAPITAL LETTERS. </p><p>It is important to remember that the words listed after the <i>Cf.</i> do not carry an equivalent sense in and of themselves. Because meaning for the signer springs from the sign, apparently unrelated glosses can be expressed by similar movements. </p><p><b>Illustrations</b> </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Illustrations appearing in sequence should not be regarded as separate depictions of parts of a sign. They are fluid and continuous, and should be used in conjunction with the verbal description of a sign, for they illustrate the main features of the sign as one movement flows into the next. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Arrows, broken or solid, indicate direction of movement. Again, they are designed to reinforce the verbal description and, where confusion may arise, the reader is cautioned to review the verbal description, always keeping himself or herself mentally in the position of the illustration (the signer). </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. As a general rule, a hand drawn with dotted or broken lines indicates the sign's initial movement or position of the hand. This is especially true if a similar drawing appears next to it using solid lines. This indicates terminal position in the continuum. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Groups of illustrations have been arranged as far as possible in visually logical order. They are read from left to right, or from top to bottom. Where confusion is possible, they have been captioned with letters A, B, C, etc. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. Small lines outlining parts of the hand, especially when they are repeated, indicate small, repeated, or wavy or jerky motions, as described in the verbal section of an entry. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. Arrows drawn side by side but pointing in opposite directions indicate repeated movement, as described in the verbal section of an entry. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G. Illustrations giving side or three-quarter views have been so placed to afford maximum visibility and to avoid foreshortening problems. The user of the dictionary should not assume a similar orientation when making the sign. As a general fule, the signer faces the person he or she is signing to. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H. Inclusion of the head in the figures permits proper orientation in the formation of certain signs. The head is omitted where there is no question of ambiguity.</p></p><h2>Tales of Troy and Greece (Wordsworth Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Andrew Lang draws on his classical learning to recount the Homeric legend of the wars between the Greeks and the Trojans. Paris, Helen of Troy, Achilles, Hector, Ulysses, the Amazons and the Wooden Horse all figure in this magical introduction to one of the greatest legends ever told. Also included in this book are the adventures of Theseus and his dramatic battle with the Minotaur with the help of Ariadne, and the quest of Jason for the Golden Fleece with the help of the Princess Medea.</p><p><p>Andrew Lang (March, 31, 1844 July 20, 1912) was a Scottish writer and literary critic who is best known as a collector of folk and fairy tales. Lang s academic interests extended beyond the literary and he was a noted contributor to the fields of anthropology, folklore, psychical research, history, and classic scholarship, as well as the inspiration for the University of St. Andrew s Andrew Lang Lectures. A prolific author, Lang published more than 100 works during his career, including twelve fairy books, in which he compiled folk and fairy tales from around the world. Lang s Lilac Fairy and Red Fairy books are credited with influencing J. R. R. Tolkien, who commented on the importance of fairy stories in the modern world in his 1939 Andrew Lang Lecture On Fairy-Stories.</p></p><h2>Economics: The User&#39;s Guide: The User&#39;s Guide</h2><p><p>In his bestselling <i>23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism</i>, Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang brilliantly debunked many of the predominant myths of neoclassical economics. Now, in an entertaining and accessible primer, he explains how the global economy actually works-in real-world terms. Writing with irreverent wit, a deep knowledge of history, and a disregard for conventional economic pieties, Chang offers insights that will never be found in the textbooks. </p><p> Unlike many economists, who present only one view of their discipline, Chang introduces a wide range of economic theories, from classical to Keynesian, revealing how each has its strengths and weaknesses, and why there is no one way to explain economic behavior. Instead, by ignoring the received wisdom and exposing the myriad forces that shape our financial world, Chang gives us the tools we need to understand our increasingly global and interconnected world often driven by economics. From the future of the Euro, inequality in China, or the condition of the American manufacturing industry here in the United States-<i>Economics: The User's Guide</i> is a concise and expertly crafted guide to economic fundamentals that offers a clear and accurate picture of the global economy and how and why it affects our daily lives.</p></p><p><p><b>Ha-Joon Chang </b>teaches in the Faculty of Economics at Cambridge University.

In it is a page torn from a German magazine of 1952. It is a photo of an elegant woman and her small daughter in the train station of Basel, Switzerland, waiting for the Orient Express. The little girl is nestled in her mother&#x2019;s tented coat and is eating a brioche. That was the first time, at the age of five, that I had my photo in a magazine. It is a sweet picture. My mother&#x2019;s older sister, Juliette, gave it to me when I was first married, but it is only recently that I realized its true importance.<br> <br>On the surface, it is a photograph of a glamorous, apparently wealthy woman en route to a ski holiday with her curly-haired little girl. The woman is not looking into the camera, but there is a hint of a smile as she knows she is being photographed. Her appearance is elegant. Nothing would indicate that only a few years before, she was in another German-speaking railroad station coming back from the Nazi concentration camps where she had been a prisoner for thirteen months, a bunch of bones, close to death from starvation and exhaustion.<br> <br>How did she feel when the photographer asked her name to be put in the magazine? Proud, I imagine, to be noticed for her style and elegance. Only seven years had passed. She was not a number anymore. She had a name; warm, beautiful, clean clothes; and most of all she had a daughter, a healthy little girl. &#x201c;God has saved my life so that I can give you life,&#x201d; she used to write me every New Year on my birthday. &#x201c;By giving you life, you gave me my life back. You are my torch, my flag of freedom.&#x201d;<br> <br>My voice catches each time I speak publicly about my mother, and I do in every speech I make, aware that I wouldn&#x2019;t be giving that speech if Lily Nahmias had not been my mother. Sometimes it feels odd that I always bring up her story, but somehow I am compelled to. It explains the child I was, the woman I became.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to tell you the story of a young girl who, at twenty-two years old, weighed fifty-nine pounds, barely the weight of her bones,&#x201d; I say to a seminar at Harvard about girls&#x2019; health. &#x201c;The reason she weighed fifty-nine pounds is that she had just spent thirteen months in the Nazi death camps of Auschwitz and Ravensbr�ck. It was a true miracle that that young girl didn&#x2019;t die, though she came very close. When she was liberated and returned to her family in Belgium, her mother fed her like a little bird, every fifteen minutes a tiny bit of food, and then a little bit more, making her feel as if she was being slowly blown up like a balloon. Within a few months her weight was close to normal.&#x201d;<br> <br>There are always murmurs in the audience when I get to that point in my mother&#x2019;s story, perhaps because it is so shocking and unexpected or maybe because I am living history to a young audience that has heard only vaguely about Auschwitz. It must be hard to imagine the high-energy, healthy woman speaking to them having a mother who weighed fifty-nine pounds. Whatever it is, I want and need to honor my mother, her courage and her strength. It is what made me the woman she wanted me to be.<br> <br>&#x201c;God has saved my life so that I can give you life.&#x201d; Her words resonate with me every day of my life. I feel it is my duty to make up for all the suffering she endured, to always celebrate freedom and live fully. My birth was her triumph. She was not supposed to survive; I was not supposed to be born. We proved them wrong. We both won the day I was born.<br> <br>I repeat a few of the lessons my mother drummed into me that have served me well. &#x201c;Fear is not an option.&#x201d; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t dwell on the dark side of things, but look for the light and build around it. If one door closes, look for another one to open.&#x201d; &#x201c;Never, ever, blame others for what befalls you, no matter how horrible it might be. Trust you, and only you, to be responsible for your own life.&#x201d; She lived those lessons. In spite of what she endured, she never wanted others to feel that she was a victim.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t used to talk nearly as much about my mother. I took her for granted, as children do their mothers. It was not until she died in 2000 that I fully realized what an incredibly huge influence she had been on me and how much I owe her. Like any child, I hadn&#x2019;t paid much attention. &#x201c;OK, OK, you told me that already,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d brush her off, or even pretend not to hear. I bridled, too, at the unsolicited advice she persisted in giving my friends. In fact, it annoyed me. Now, of course, I feel I have had the experience and earned the wisdom to hand out my own unsolicited advice, and I press every lesson my mother taught me on my children, grandchildren, and anyone I talk to. I have become her.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know, as a very little girl in Brussels, why my mother had two lines of blue tattooed numbers on her left arm. I remember thinking they were some sort of decoration and wished I had them, too, so my arms wouldn&#x2019;t look so plain. I didn&#x2019;t understand why the housekeeper often told me not to bother her when she was lying down in her bedroom. I instinctively knew my mother needed her rest and I would tiptoe around the house so I wouldn&#x2019;t disturb her.<br> <br>Sometimes I&#x2019;d ignore the housekeeper&#x2019;s instructions and, gathering my beloved little picture books, I would sneak into her darkened room in the hope she would smile and read them to me. More often than not she did. She loved books and taught me to cherish them. She read my little picture books to me so many times I memorized them. One of my favorite things to do was to fake reading them, carefully turning the pages at the right time and showing off, pretending that I could read.<br> <br>My mother was very strict. I never doubted that she loved me, but if I said something she didn&#x2019;t approve of or failed to live up to her expectations, she would give me a severe look or pinch me. I would be sent to the corner, my face to the wall. Sometimes I would go to the corner by myself, knowing I had done wrong. She spent a lot of time with me, sometimes playing, but mostly teaching me anything she could think of. She read me fairy tales and would tease me when I got scared. I remember how she amused herself by telling me that I was an abandoned child she had found in the garbage. I would cry until she took me in her arms, consoling me. She wanted me to be strong and not be afraid. She was very demanding. Before I had learned how to read, she had me memorize and recite the seventeenth-century fables of La Fontaine. As soon as I was old enough to write, she insisted I write stories and letters with perfect spelling and grammar. I remember how proud I was when she praised me.<br> <br>To train me never to succumb to shyness, she made me give a speech at every family gathering, teaching me to be comfortable speaking in public no matter the audience. Like many children I was scared of the dark, but unlike most mothers, she shut me in a dark closet and waited outside so I would learn for myself that there was nothing to be afraid of. That was just one of the times she&#x2019;d say &#x201c;Fear is not an option.&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother did not believe in coddling children too much or overprotecting them. She wanted me to be independent and responsible for myself. My earliest memories are of traveling with my parents and being left alone in the hotel room while they went out to dinner. I did not mind nor did I feel lonely. I was so proud that they trusted me to stay alone. I liked entertaining myself and feeling grown up. To this day, I have the same feeling and sense of freedom when I check into a hotel room alone.<br> <br>When my parents allowed me to join them in a restaurant, my mother often encouraged me to get up and check out the room, and sometimes, even to go outside and report to her what I&#x2019;d seen, who I had met. That instilled curiosity in me&#x2014;watch what other people do, make friends with people I do not know. When I was nine, she sent me on the train from Brussels to Paris all by myself to visit her sister, my favorite aunt, Mathilde. I felt so proud to be responsible for myself. I think, deep down, I was a bit nervous, but I would never admit it and pride overcame the fear.<br> <br>I still like to travel alone, and at times prefer it. Even on business trips, I don&#x2019;t like traveling with an entourage because it limits my freedom and reduces the fun of the unpredictable. I love the adventure, that feeling of excitement and satisfaction I had when I was a little girl. To be alone on the road, in an airport, with my bag, my passport, my credit cards, my phone, and a camera makes me feel so free and happy. I thank my mother for always encouraging me to &#x201c;go.&#x201d;<br> <br>Independence. Freedom. Self-reliance. Those were the values she was drumming into me, and she did it with such naturalness that I never questioned or resisted her. There was no other way but to be responsible for myself. As much as I loved and respected her, I was certainly a little frightened of her, and never wanted to displease her. I understand now that she was processing all of her past frustrations and unhappy experiences and putting them into a package of strength and positivity. That is the gift she prepared for me. It felt occasionally like a heavy burden, but I never questioned it, even if I sometimes wished I belonged to some other family.<br> <br>Happily she let up on me somewhat when I was six and my baby brother, Philippe, was born. I adored him. To my surprise, having never played with dolls, I felt maternal, and to this day I think of him as my first child. As the older sister, I played with him and sometimes tortured him a bit, but as my mother had done to me, I taught him everything I knew and was very protective. When we played doctor, I asked him to urinate into a little bottle, only to then laugh at him that he had actually done it. We also used to play travel agency with my parents&#x2019; airline brochures, scheduling and booking imaginary trips all over the world.<br> <br>Philippe says he realized that I loved him the day I transcribed all the words from a Beatles record while I was at boarding school in England, and sent them to him. There were no computers then, no Internet, no iTunes, just a doting sister with pen and paper, listening to the lyrics and transcribing them. We&#x2019;re still extremely close, and he is still my baby brother, whom I always try to impress and tease. Philippe is a successful businessman in Brussels, has two amazing daughters, Sarah and Kelly, and his wife, Greta, launched and runs DVF Belgium. Philippe and I talk on the phone every weekend and whenever I miss my parents, I call him.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t think my mother was half as hard on him as she&#x2019;d been with me. He was a boy, after all, and we are much softer and less demanding toward boys in our family. It was I she related to, the daughter she was determined would survive whatever life threw at her. As I grew older, I understood. Independence and freedom were key to her because she had lost both. Self-reliance had kept her alive.<br> <br>My mother was twenty and engaged to my father in 1944 when the Nazi SS arrested her on May 17 for working in the Belgian Resistance. She was living in a &#x201c;safe house&#x201d; and her job was to go around Brussels on her bicycle to deliver documents and fake papers to those who needed them. Immediately after her arrest, she was thrown onto a crowded truck, which took her and many other suspected saboteurs to a prison in Malines, Flanders, a city twenty-five kilometers from Brussels. To avoid being tortured into giving information about others in the resistance, she said she knew nothing and that she was hiding in the safe house because she was Jewish. The woman who was interrogating her advised her not to say she was Jewish. She ignored it and was deported on the twenty-fifth transport, which left Malines on May 19, 1944. She was sent to Auschwitz and given prisoner number 5199.<br> <br>My mother often told me how she&#x2019;d written her parents a note on a scrap of paper and dropped it from the truck onto the street. She hoped but had no idea whether anyone ever picked it up and delivered it. It wasn&#x2019;t until after her death that I found out that the message had been delivered. I&#x2019;d loaned the house she&#x2019;d owned on Harbour Island in the Bahamas to my first cousin Salvator. Salvator left me a thick envelope full of family photographs, in the midst of which was a sealed envelope marked &#x201c;Lily, 1944.&#x201d; Inside was a piece of torn paper with faint handwriting. I stared at it until I finally made out the words:<br> <br>Dear Mommy and Daddy,<br> <br>I am writing to tell you that your little Lily is leaving. Where, she does not know, but God is everywhere isn&#x2019;t he? So she will never be alone or unhappy.<br> <br>I want you both to be courageous, and not forget that you have to be in good health for my wedding. I am counting more than ever in having a beautiful ceremony.<br> <br>I want you to know that I am leaving with a smile, I promise. I love you very very much and will soon kiss you more than ever.<br> <br>Your little daughter,<br> <br>Lily<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t breathe. Could I be holding the actual note my mother had told me she had written to her parents on that truck, using a burnt match for a pencil? On the other side of the note was a plea for anybody finding the piece of paper to please deliver it to her parents&#x2019; address. Somebody had found it and delivered it to her parents and my aunt Juliette, Salvator&#x2019;s mother, had kept it in a sealed envelope all these years!<br> <br>I was in shock; I&#x2019;d only half-believed her story of the note. All these stories about her arrest and deportation seemed surreal, more like a movie script, and yet they were true. She had always told me that she was more worried about her parents than herself. I held the proof in my shaky hands.<br> <br>I walked out of the house in a daze and across the beach into the clear blue water. &#x201c;This explains who I am,&#x201d; I said out loud to myself. &#x201c;I am the daughter of a woman who went to the concentration camps with a smile.&#x201d;<br> <br>The sayings she had drummed into me as a child and which had sometimes annoyed me took on whole new meanings. She had often illustrated one of her favorites&#x2014;&#x201c;you never really know what is good for you; what may seem the absolute worst thing to happen to you can, in fact, be the best&#x201d;&#x2014;by her story of the inhuman train ride to Auschwitz and her arrival.<br> <br>No food. No water. No air. No toilet. Four days jammed in a cattle car. An &#x201c;older woman&#x201d; in her forties who spoke a little German comforted my mother and gave her a sense of protection. My mother made sure never to leave her side, especially when they arrived at Auschwitz and were unloaded onto a ramp. Women with children were immediately separated from the rest and sent toward long, low buildings while the others were forced into a long line. At the head of the line, a soldier directed the prisoners into two groups. Looking on, from the top of the ramp, was an officer in white.<br> <br>When it came her turn, the older woman was directed to the group being formed on the left and my mother quickly followed her. The soldier did not stop her, but the white-coated officer, who had not interfered until then, did. Striding down the ramp, he walked directly to my mother, yanked her away from her friend, and threw her into the group on the right. My mother always said that she&#x2019;d never felt such sheer hatred for anyone as she felt for that man.<br> <br>That man was Dr. Josef Mengele, she found out later, the notorious Angel of Death, who killed or mutilated many, many prisoners in medical experiments, esp...</p><h2>Gods of Love and Ecstasy: The Traditions of Shiva and Dionysus</h2><p>Shiva and Dionysus are the Hindu and Greek gods of magical power, intoxication, ecstatic sexuality, and transcendence who initiate us into communion with the creative forces of life.

The Pathwork has been a most positive result of such a contact, helping many people find a deeper truth and clarity in their lives; therefore the energy and spirit embodied in these transmissions that gave birth to the Pathwork deserve our consideration, for they have demonstrated their value in the blessings they have already made possible. &#x2014;David Spangler, author of The Call and A Pilgrim in Aquarius</p><p></p><h2>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Jazz Age Stories (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The inspiration for the major motion picture starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, plus eighteen other stories by the beloved author of&nbsp;<i>The Great Gatsby</i></b><br><br> In the title story of this collection by one of America&#x2019;s greatest writers, a baby born in 1860 begins life as an old man and proceeds to age backward.

Those of us unable to discriminate between geniune scientific research and the pseudoscientific nonsense that has resulted in fantastic theories and fancies have long needed James Randi and Flim-Flam!In this book, Randi explores and exposes what he believes to be the outrageous deception that has been promoted widely in the media. Unafraid to call researchers to account for their failures and impostures, Randi tells us that we have been badly served by scientists who have failed to follow the procedures required by their training and traditions. Here he shows us how what he views as sloppy research has been followed by rationalizations of evident failures, and we see these errors and misrepresentations clearly pointed out.

Groups of Christians-from illiterate peasants to learned intellectuals-moved out to the wastelands beyond the Nile Valley and, in the famous words of Saint Athanasius, made the desert a city. In so doing, they captured the imagination of the ancient world. They forged techniques of prayer and asceticism, of discipleship and spiritual direction, that have remained central to Christianity ever since. Seeking to map the soul's long journey to God and plot out the subtle vagaries of the human heart, they created and inspired texts that became classics of Western spirituality. These Desert Christians were also brilliant storytellers, some of Christianity's finest. This book introduces the literature of early monasticism. It examines all the best-known works, including Athanasius' <em>Life of Antony</em>, the <em>Lives of Pachomius</em>, and the so-called <em>Sayings of the Desert Fathers</em>. Later chapters focus on two pioneers of monastic theology: Evagrius Ponticus, the first great theoretician of Christian mysticism; and John Cassian, who brought Egyptian monasticism to the Latin West. Along the way, readers are introduced to path-breaking discoveries-to new texts and recent archeological finds-that have revolutionized contemporary scholarship on monastic origins. Included are fascinating snippets from papyri and from little-known Coptic, Syriac, and Ethiopic texts. Interspersed in each chapter are illustrations, maps, and diagrams that help readers sort through the key texts and the richly-textured world of early monasticism. Geared to a wide audience and written in clear, jargon-free prose, <em>Desert Christians</em> offers the most comprehensive and accessible introduction to early monasticism.<br></p><p><br><strong>William Harmless, S.J.</strong> is Professor of Theology at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska.

Kass brilliantly reveals how the various aspects of this phenomenon, and the customs, rituals, and taboos surrounding it, relate to universal and profound truths about the human animal and its deepest yearnings.<br> <br> "Kass is a distinguished and graceful writer. . . . It is astonishing to discover how different is our world from that of the animals, even in that which most evidently betrays that we too are animals&#x2014;our need and desire for food."&#x2014;Roger Scruton, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br> <br> "Yum."&#x2014;Miss Manners<br> <br></p></p><p>Leon R. Kass, M.D. is the Addie Clark Harding Professor in the College and the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago.Doctor-turned-teacher Kass (Committee on Social Thought/Univ. of Chicago) serves up a stimulating treatise on the anthropology and ethics of eating. In the tradition of ancient philosophers of the good life, Kass suggests how rituals of eating bring the wisdom, friendship, and transcendence that our hungry souls desire. He spices his book with episodes and advice from the Greek and Hebrew classics, topped off with a recounting of Isak Dinesen's Babette's Feast. Gourmands will enjoy browsing for gustatory lore, but Kass has a specific argument to make. With a charmingly eccentric scholasticism, he proposes a model of the human being as the animal that eats, rather than simply feeds. Philosophical meditations on the nature of form, although they take a while to develop fully, lead to a consideration of human omnivorousness and the ethical controls that it requires. Thus, Kass surveys conventions of eating, from taboos against cannibalism to dinner-party rituals. Championing civilized eating, he sees dietary laws, as exemplified by the Book of Leviticus, as reflections of our place in the universe and in relation to nature. Alongside such grand ideas come cantankerous complaints about young people today not covering their mouths when they yawn and about eating on the street--the public licking of ice cream comes in for criticism. Such discriminations of value, however, lie at the heart of Kass's enterprise; even when they appear silly, they enrich his book. One warms to him as one would to an odd, but ultimately good-hearted dinner companion. By the end of the book, one can enjoy the pithy truths even in apparently bland remarks like ``life, as has been observed, is not just a bowl of cherries.'' An agreeable repast, one that will ethically inform even those ill-mannered readers who prefer to help themselves buffet-style rather than wait for the various courses of the argument to be served. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

For those who use and love the language most intensely, the &#34;OED has no peer. With more than 22,000 pages of definitions, nearly 2.5 illustrative quotations from writers as disparate as Geoffrey Chaucer and Erica Jong, William Shakespeare and Raymond Chandler, Charles Darwin and Quentin Tarantino, the OED is a dictionary like no other. Its entries offer the most authoritative definitions, detailed information on pronunciation, variant spellings throughout each word&#39;s history, extensive treatment of etymology, and details of area of usage and of any regional characteristics (including geographical origins). It is, as &#34;Time observed, &#34;a scholarly Everest.&#34;</p><p>The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> has long been considered the ultimate reference work in English lexicography. Compiled by the legendary editor James Murray and a staff of brilliant philologists and lexicographers (not to mention one homicidal maniac), the <em>OED</em> began as a a supplement to existing dictionaries, so that, as one lexicographer put it, "every word should be made to tell its own story." Enthusiastic readers sent Murray definitions and examples on identical slips of paper in response to a letter of appeal in 1879. By the time the last volume was published in 1928, the dictionary had swelled from 4 to 10 volumes containing over 400,000 entries. In the years since, the staff of the <em>OED</em> has continued to keep pace with our ever-evolving language, and today the dictionary weighs in at a whopping 20 volumes. The great joy of this dictionary lies in its extensive cross-references and word etymologies, which can run a full page or more. These features not only make the <em>OED</em> the most comprehensive and authoritative dictionary of the English language, but a delight to browse. <p></p> <p><strong>What writers like most about the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i></strong><br> </p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> <td>"I&#x2019;m tempted to say that I love the <i>OED</i> because it contains every word in <i>Middlemarch</i> and <i>To the Lighthouse</i>, minus the unnecessary ones.

Each article is by a scholar whose expertise corresponds to the topic at hand: Oliver Taplin discusses Greek theater; Martin Esslin, modern theater; Leslie du S. Read, theater in Africa and pre-Columbian America, etc. This strategy avoids the Eurocentrism of many other theater histories, even though most of the book is still concerned with Western theater; for, indeed, some of the complexity and diversity of traditions influencing contemporary drama and performance theory are accurately conveyed. Of course, the chapters are not all equally satisfying: Taplin on the Greeks manages to shed new light on an often discussed topic, whereas Read's too-short section on Africa and the Americas leaves us wanting to know much more about these scarcely discussed non-Western traditions. <i>Jack Helbig</i></p><h2>Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics for Veterinary Technicians</h2><p><p>Grasp complex concepts and develop fundamental knowledge in the rapidly changing field of veterinary pharmacology with<b> <i>Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics for </i>Veterinary Technicians, 4th Edition</b>.

One day, Muir set out to explore a huge glacier during a blizzard. Stickeen--an aloof little dog belonging to a fellow traveler--insisted on going along. They become stranded on the glacier. The only way out was over a precarious ice bridge, dangerous for a man and almost impossible for a dog.

With its detailed yet thoroughly readable text and 170 illustrations (many published here for the first time), this book brings to light much new information about Kline, a leading figure among the Abstract Expressionists, and enriches our appreciation and understanding of his art. This book belongs on the book shelf of everyone with an interest in American painting.<br> <br>Franz Kline's energetic black strokes on a white field are as recognizable as Jackson Pollock&#x2019;s drips or Mark Rothko&#x2019;s rectangles of glowing color. He spent years struggling to find a style for himself and then achieved "overnight success" with his dramatic black and white abstractions. They were, in fact, so successful that they overwhelmed every other aspect of Kline's art, and as a result he has been oversimplified and underestimated. Based on nearly 20 years of research, this seminal monograph provides a comprehensive view of Kline's life and work and reveals how unexpectedly complex they both were.<br> <br>Using interviews with the artist's friends and critics, and quoting from his letters, the author, Harry F. Gaugh, has created an evocative portrait of Kline's evolution from ambitious art student, to penniless Greenwich Village artist painting murals in bars, to, finally, a mature artist in command of his own unique and hard-won style.<br></p><p><b>Harry F. Gaugh,</b> an art historian specializing in postwar American art, taught at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York, until his death in 1992. The leading authority on Franz Kline, Gaugh curated the landmark exhibition <i>The Vital Gesture: Franz Kline in Retrospect</i>. His other books include the volume on Willem de Kooning in Abbeville&#x2019;s <i>Modern Masters</i> series.<br>Excerpt from <b> <i>Franz Kline</i> </b> <br> <br>Foreword<br> <br>Abstract Expressionism, an American movement, was a dominant international presence in painting during the 1950s and 60s. It artists turned away from regionalism, storytelling, and literalism that had previously characterized the art of this country. The New York School painters were never grouped formally, nor were they united by a homogeneous style, yet their paintings and drawings generally shared abstraction, large scale, and immediate assertiveness.<br> <br>Franz Kline (1910 1962) was a giant figure among the Abstract Expressionists, His place in art and in history of twentieth-century painting has not previously been the subject of a major monograph nor an extensive exhibition showing such a wide range of high-quality work. We are grateful to Harry F. Gaugh, associate professor of art history at Skidmore College and noted scholar on Kline and de Kooning, for writing this study and for serving as guest curator of <i>The Vital Gesture: Franz Kline in Retrospect.</i> <br> <br>The exhibition&#x2019;s itinerary the Cincinnati Art Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts makes it accessible to appreciate audiences from east to west, and it introduces Kline to generations who have heard about this present-century old master&#x201d; but have never seen such an impressive array of his works. That so many private collections, museums, foundations, and corporations would part with their Kline paintings and drawings for the duration of the exhibition deserves our heartfelt thanks.<br> <br>An exhibition on this scale would not be possible without significant financial support from several sources. We are exceedingly grateful to the Central Trust Company, the National Endowment for the Arts, and A.M. Kinney, Inc., for their generous contributions.<br> <br>The coordinator of the monograph and exhibition and, indeed, the individual responsible for the initiation and implementation of this project was Denny T. Young, curator of painting at the Cincinnati Art Museum. We are indebted to her for all her efforts. We also greatly appreciate the assistance of Frances Martinabli, curatorial assistant, Painting Department, and the many others whose work has brought this project to fruition.<br> <br>Millard F.

Two bodies have been found in a burned building. One is a missing person from Kerney&#39;s cold case files. The other is a more recent homicide. Both will lead father and son into a vast network of crime...and the darkest places of the soul.</p><p>Santa Fe Police Chief Kevin Kerney never solved the disappearance of Anna Maria Montoya 11 years ago. Then her remains are discovered in the ruins of an abandoned fruit stand in Lincoln County, along with the charred corpse of John Humphrey, whose killer set the fire that revealed Montoya's final resting place. The deputy sheriff investigating Humphrey's murder is Clayton Istee, the estranged son Kerney only recently learned he had. Meanwhile Kerney investigates Montoya's possible ties to a modeling agency that may be a front for a prostitution ring catering to VIPs, Istee focuses on the connection between his murder victim and an illegal gambling operation in rural southern New Mexico. By the time the author ties the parallel but seemingly unrelated investigations together in this intricately plotted thriller, the two lawmen--father and son--have begun to develop a personal as well as a professional relationship, which will likely flower in future outings in this popular series. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Michael McGarrity is author of the Anthony Award-nominated <b>Tularosa</b>, <b>Mexican Hat</b>, <b>Serpent Gate</b>, <b>Hermit's Peak</b>, <b>The Judas Judge</b>, <b>Under the Color of Law</b>, and <b>The Big Gamble</b>.

It recounts the story of Sheikh Nuruddin,&nbsp;a dervish&nbsp;residing in&nbsp;an&nbsp;Islamic&nbsp;monastery in Sarajevo in the eighteenth century during the&nbsp;Ottoman Turk&nbsp;hegemony over the Balkans. When his brother is arrested, he must descend into the Kafkaesque world of the Ottoman authorities in his search to discover what happened to him. He&nbsp;narrates his story in the form of an elaborate suicide note, regularly misquoting the Koran. In time, he begins to question his relations with society as a whole and, eventually, his life choices in general.<br><br> Hugely successful when published in the 1960s,<i>&nbsp;Death and the Dervish&nbsp;</i>is an enduring&nbsp;classic made into a feature length film in 1974.</p><p>Mesa Selimovic (1910&#x2013;1982) was born in Tuzla, Bosnia.

Her admirers include Grace Paley, Jonathan Franzen, and Zadie Smith; as <i>Time </i>magazine observed, her stories are "moving . . . and somehow inevitable, as if she has written what we were all on the verge of thinking."</p><p>In <i>Varieties of Disturbance</i>, her fourth collection, Davis extends her reach as never before in stories that take every form from sociological studies to concise poems. Her subjects include the five senses, fourth-graders, good taste, and tropical storms. She offers a reinterpretation of insomnia and re-creates the ordeals of Kafka in the kitchen. She questions the lengths to which one should go to save the life of a caterpillar, proposes a clear account of the sexual act, rides the bus, probes the limits of marital fidelity, and unlocks the secret to a long and happy life.</p><p>No two of these fictions are alike. And yet in each, Davis rearranges our view of the world by looking beyond our preconceptions to a bizarre truth, a source of delight and surprise.</p><p><i>Varieties of Disturbance</i> is a 2007 National Book Award Finalist for Fiction.</p></p><p><b>LYDIA DAVIS</b> is the author of one novel and five story collections, most recently <i>Can&#x2019;t and Won&#x2019;t</i>.

I say to myself: Mother ought not to have improper relations with this man "Franz"! "Franz" is a European. I say she should not see this man improperly while Father is away! But I am confusing an old reality with a new reality: Father will not be returning home. He will be staying on at Vernon Hall. As for Mother, she is ninety-four years old. How can there be improper relations with a woman of ninety-four? Yet my confusion must be this: though her body is old, her capacity for betrayal is still young and fresh.</p> <p>Dog and Me</p> <p>An ant can look up at you, too, and even threaten you with its arms. Of course, my dog does not know I am human, he sees me as dog, though I do not leap up at a fence. I am a strong dog. But I do not leave my mouth hanging open when I walk along. Even on a hot day, I do not leave my tongue hanging out. But I bark at him: "No! No!"</p> <p>Enlightened</p> <p>I don&#x2019;t know if I can remain friends with her. I&#x2019;ve thought and thought about it&#x2014;she&#x2019;ll never know how much. I gave it one last try. I called her, after a year. But I didn&#x2019;t like the way the conversation went. The problem is that she is not very enlightened. Or I should say she is not enlightened enough for me. She is nearly fifty years old and no more enlightened, as far as I can see, than when I first knew her twenty years ago, when we talked mainly about men. I did not mind how unenlightened she was then, maybe because I was not so enlightened myself. I believe I am more enlightened now, and certainly more enlightened than she is, although I know it&#x2019;s not very enlightened to say that. But I want to say it, so I am willing to postpone being more enlightened myself so that I can still say a thing like that about a friend.</p> <p>The Good Taste Contest</p> <p>The husband and wife were competing in a Good Taste Contest judged by a jury of their peers, men and women of good taste, including a fabric designer, a rare-book dealer, a pastry cook, and a librarian. The wife was judged to have better taste in furniture, especially antique furniture. The husband was judged to have overall poor taste in lighting fixtures, tableware, and glassware. The wife was judged to have indifferent taste in window treatments, but the husband and wife both were judged to have good taste in floor coverings, bed linen, bath linen, large appliances, and small appliances. The husband was felt to have good taste in carpets, but only fair taste in upholstery fabrics. The husband was felt to have very good taste in both food and alcoholic beverages, while the wife had inconsistently good to poor taste in food. The husband had better taste in clothes than the wife though inconsistent taste in perfumes and colognes. While both husband and wife were judged to have no more than fair taste in garden design, they were judged to have good taste in number and variety of evergreens. The husband was felt to have excellent taste in roses but poor taste in bulbs. The wife was felt to have better taste in bulbs and generally good taste in shade plantings with the exception of hostas. The husband&#x2019;s taste was felt to be good in garden furniture but only fair in ornamental planters. The wife&#x2019;s taste was judged consistently poor in garden statuary. After a brief discussion, the judges gave the decision to the husband for his higher overall points score.</p> <p>Collaboration with Fly</p> <p>I put that word on the page,</p> <p>but he added the apostrophe.</p> <p></p> <p>Excerpted from Varieties Of Disturbance by Lydia Davis.<br>Copyright 2007 by Lydia Davis.<br>Published in First edition, 2007 by Farrar, Straus And Giroux.<br>All rights reserved.

Published to critical acclaim, his first collection is powered by big themes and even bigger ideas. There are stories about a van fuelled by Cork people&#39;s accents, Tipperary&#39;s first ISIS recruit, a sexually aggressive banshee and a fridge dragged heroically through the streets of Limerick. The Gospel According to Blindboy questions and challenges the complacencies and contradictions at the heart of modern Ireland. Whip-smart, provocative and animated by his unmistakable dark wit, it is one of the most original collections of short stories to emerge in recent years. `Mad, wild, hysterical, and all completely under the writer&#39;s control - this is a brilliant debut.&#39; Kevin Barry `There is genius in this book, warped genius. Like you&#39;d expect from a man who for his day job wears a plastic bag on his head but something beyond that too.

But once they see the Bible as a Great Story, they begin to see how their own lives fit into what God has done and is doing in the world. New Testament scholar J. Scott Duvall and Old Testament expert J. Daniel Hays wrote Living God&#x2019;s Word to help Christians consider how their lives can be integrated into the story of the Bible, thus enabling them to live faithfully in deep and important ways. They survey the entire Bible through broad themes that trace the progression of God&#x2019;s redemptive plan. Each section deals with a certain portion of Scripture&#x2019;s story and includes reading/listening preparation, explanation, summary, observations about theological significance, connections to the Great Story, and written assignments for further study. These features&#x2015;combined with the authors&#x2019; engaging style&#x2015;make&nbsp;Living God&#x2019;s Word an ideal introductory college text, Sunday school elective, or small group study.</p></p><p>J.

Many biologists end up using spreadsheet programs for most of their data-processing tasks and spend hours clicking around or copying and pasting, and then repeating the process for other data files.<br><br><em>Practical Computing for Biologists</em> shows you how to use many freely available computing tools to work more powerfully and effectively. The book was born out of the authors' own experience in developing tools for their research and helping other biologists with their computational problems. Although many of the techniques are relevant to molecular bioinformatics, the motivation for the book is much broader, focusing on topics and techniques that are applicable to a range of scientific endeavors. Twenty-two chapters organized into six parts address these topics (and more; see Contents):<br> *Searching with regular expressions<br><br>*The Unix command line<br><br> *Python programming and debugging<br><br> *Creating and editing graphics<br><br> *Databases<br><br> *Performing analyses on remote servers<br><br> *Working with electronics<br>While most of the concepts and examples apply to any operating system, the main narrative focuses on Mac OS X. Where there are differences for Windows and Linux users, parallel instructions are provided in the margin and in an appendix. The book is designed to be used as a self-guided resource for researchers, a companion book in a course, or as a primary textbook. <em>Practical Computing for Biologists</em> will free you from the most frustrating and time-consuming aspects of data processing so you can focus on the pleasures of scientific inquiry.<br><strong>RESOURCES</strong><br><br><strong>For Students</strong><br><br>The Companion Website includes downloads, community forums, tips and examples, and textbook errata and updates.<br><br><strong>For Instructors</strong><br><br>The Instructor's Resource Library features all of the textbook's figures and tables, provided in ready-to-use PowerPoint presentations.<br></p><p><br><strong>Steven H.D. Haddock</strong> is a Research Scientist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and adjunct Associate Professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, studying bioluminescence and biodiversity of gelatinous zooplankton. He started programming in BASIC on an Apple ][ and began his undergraduate studies in engineering before deciding to change fields. He took this programming background with him to his graduate studies in Marine Biology, where he quickly realized the advantages that computing skills offered and felt compelled to help foster these abilities in others. He has developed many utilities and devices for research, including instruments to monitor bioluminescence from fireflies, a freezer monitoring system, a web-based conference registration database, and a PCR calculator for smartphones. In addition to teaching invertebrate zoology and writing a booklet to teach the technique of blue-water scuba diving, he has given tutorials in computing to students and administrators. His interest in education extends to his Bioluminescence Web Page (http://lifesci.ucsb.edu/~biolum/) and the Jellywatch.org citizen-science website (www.jellywatch.org).<br><br><strong>Casey W. Dunn</strong>, a Professor at Yale University, does research that has a large computational component but always in conjunction with work in the field and lab. His first interest in computers stemmed from building electronics, and he further developed his computational skills working in Silicon Valley while an undergraduate. As his data sets grew larger and larger during grad school and his postdoc, he found himself reaching back to his computer background more often. In the course of his own research and helping other biologists with their computational challenges, he became concerned about the mismatch between training opportunities and the real day-to-day computational problems biologists face. In addition to teaching invertebrate biology, evolution, and development, his educational activities include the websites siphonophores.org and creaturecast.org. Dr. Dunn is the recipient of the National Science Foundation's 2011 Alan T. Waterman Award, recognizing an outstanding young researcher in any field of science or engineering supported by NSF.<br><br>"<em>Practical Computing for Biologists</em> is a clear guide to methods that unlock the power of the personal computer. Although the breadth of subjects covered is certainly an asset of this volume, what really makes the book stand out is how well the authors clearly describe each technique and its applicability to biological sciences. It is a great launching point for any necessary further investigation of computational techniques." <br>--Matthew Aiello-Lammens, <em>The Quarterly Review of Biology</em><p></p><br>"The book covers a wide range of subjects that truly justifies the title of 'practical computing.' In addition to the usual programming-related topics, it also includes a thorough introduction to the programming environment, approaches to combining different programs together, a description of the basic text manipulation tools such as regular expressions, and even an introduction to dealing with digital art and images. As such the book is great value for the money, being at least three books in one." <br>--Olga G. Troyanskaya, <em>Cell</em><p></p><br>"My copy of <em>Practical Computing for Biologists</em> arrived last week, and I've been very impressed. It is a well-written, well-paced guide to basic computing skills for scientists and engineers of all stripes (not just biologists). It is beautifully produced: full-color printing and great graphical design make this book a joy to read. If I ever do turn Software Carpentry into a book, I might skip the topics PCB covers and just tell people to go and buy it." <br>--Greg Wilson, <em>software-carpentry.org</em><p></p><br>"When considering my research and use of time, this book has been the most important book I've read in the last year, and perhaps the last decade. Striking a perfect balance by guiding you through tutorials and nudging your own self-exploration, the book has just enough guided direction to not annoy or overwhelm. It has helped (and is still helping) me to do what I was doing before, but more efficiently." <br>--<em>Cyme &amp; Cystidium</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Technology In Action, Introductory</h2><p><p> <i>For introductory courses in computer concepts, digital literacy, or computer literacy, often including instruction in Microsoft� Office.<br> </i> <b> <br>Using technology to teach technology<br> </b>Best-selling <b> <i>Technology in Action Introductory</i> </b> uses practical content and hands-�on projects to engage students in computing tasks and skills they can apply at work, in class, or at home.

A native of Cincinnati, Ohio, she now lives with her husband in Massachusetts.Entertaining, whether a formal sit-down dinner or a backyard barbecue, has long been a mainstay of Southern life, and so it's only right that the members of the Charleston Junior League should have assembled this collection of their favorite party recipes. The recipes are simple, and the majority use readily available ingredients. Readers will find something to suit just about every kind of occasion, from a football tailgate to a fancy supper. No matter what style of entertaining readers may enjoy, this book provides some delicious offerings. The bulk of the recipes lean toward savories and hors d'oeuvres for buffet-style get-togethers. These recipes are perfect for busy working couples or for others who prefer a scaled-back form of entertaining. The recipes are also well suited to less experienced cooks, and are illustrated with quotes and comments about life in Charleston, including the history of the term "receipts." The contributors give much advice about party planning, and readers should pay particular attention to the seafood chapter, which makes the most of Charleston's seacoast heritage with recipes incorporating crab meat, catfish and shrimp. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Matthew Henry&#39;s Commentary on the Whole Bible: Complete and Unabridged</h2><p><p>This is the only complete and unabridged one-volume edition of Matthew Henry's famous work.</p><p>Now, this classic volume has been re-typset and features a slimmer and handier trim size and an attractive new cover.</p><p>"First among the mighty (commentaries) for general usefulness we are bound to mention the man whose name is a household word, Matthew Henry.

Collected here for the first time in paperback, the essays, articles, observations&#x2014;and even some untypical country-music lyrics&#x2014;offer a rare overview of the eclectic sensibility of an American original.<b> <br><br></b>Whether rocking with the Doors, depoliticizing Picasso&#x2019;s <i>Guernica,</i> lamenting the angst-ridden state of contemporary literature, or drooling over tomato sandwiches and a species of womanhood he calls &#x201c;the genius waitress,&#x201d; Tom Robbins&#x2019;s briefer writings exhibit the five traits that perhaps best characterize his novels: an imaginative wit, a cheerfully brash disregard for convention, a sweetly nasty eroticism, a mystical but keenly observant eye, and an irrepressible love of language. Embedded in this primarily journalistic compilation are brand-new short stories, a sheaf of largely unpublished poems, and an offbeat assessment of our divided nation. Wherever you open <b>Wild Ducks Flying Backward</b><i>,</i> you&#x2019;ll encounter the serious playfulness that percolates from the mind of a self-described &#x201c;romantic Zen hedonist&#x201d; and &#x201c;stray dog in the banquet halls of culture.&#x201d;</p><p>Tom Robbins has been called &#x201c;a vital natural resource&#x201d; by <i>The Oregonian</i>, &#x201c;one of the wildest and most entertaining novelists in the world&#x201d; by the <i>Financial Times</i> of London, and &#x201c;the most dangerous writer in the world today&#x201d; by Fernanda Pivano of Italy&#x2019;s Corriere della Sera. A Southerner by birth, Robbins has lived in and around Seattle since 1962.<i>Canyon of the Vaginas</i><br>When one is on a pilgrimage to the Canyon of the Vaginas, one has to be careful about asking directions.<br><br>I mean, there&#x2019;re some pretty rough ol&#x2019; dudes in west-central Nevada. One knows the ol&#x2019; dudes are rough when one observes that they eat with their hats on.<br><br>Nine days I was in the high desert between Winnemucca and Las Vegas, during which time I never witnessed a male Homo sapiens take his noontide nor his evening repast with an exposed bean. In every instance, a grimy bill or brim shaded the fellow&#x2019;s victuals from the vulgar eye of light. I assumed that they breakfasted en chapeau as well, but by the hour that your pilgrim sat down to his flapjacks, the rough ol&#x2019; dudes had already gone off to try to strike it rich.<br><br>When a man&#x2019;s brain is constantly heated by thoughts of striking it rich, thoughts that don&#x2019;t fade much at mealtime, perhaps he requires some sort of perpetual head cover to cool the cerebral machinery. On the other hand, since they live in relatively close proximity to America&#x2019;s major nuclear test site, a nerve-gas depot, several mysterious airfields, and numerous depositories for our government&#x2019;s nasty toxic secrets, maybe the rough ol&#x2019; dudes are just trying to prevent their haircuts from ever flickering in the dark. If I lived in west-central Nevada, I might dine in gloves and a Mylex suit.<br><br>Naturally, one has to wonder if the men of Nevada also sleep in their hats. More pointedly, do they sleep with their wives, girlfriends, and thoroughly legal prostitutes in their hats? I intended to interview a Nevada woman or two on the subject, but never quite got around to it. However, something at the Canyon of the Vaginas gave me reason to believe that the answer is affirmative. Of that, more later.<br><br>Getting back on course, beneath those baseball caps that advertise brands of beer or heavy equipment, under those genuine imitation Stetsons, there&#x2019;re some rough ol&#x2019; hangovers being processed and some rough ol&#x2019; ideas being entertained. One simply does not approach a miner, a wrangler, a prospector, a gambler, a Stealth pilot, a construction sweat hog, or sandblasted freebooter and interrupt his thoughts about big, fast bucks and those forces&#x2014;environmental legislation, social change, loaded dice, et cetera&#x2014;that could stand between him and big, fast bucks; one simply does not march up to such a man, a man who lifts his crusty lid to no one, and ask:<br><br>&#x201c;Sir, might you possibly direct me to the Canyon of the Vaginas?&#x201d;<br><br>***********<br><br>Should readers desire to make their own pilgrimage to the Canyon of the Vaginas&#x2014;and it is, after all, one of the few holy places left in America&#x2014;they&#x2019;ll have to find it by themselves. Were one to inquire of its whereabouts at a bar or gas station (in west-central Nevada they&#x2019;re often one and the same, complete with slot machines), the best that one could hope for is that a dude would wink and aim one at the pink gates of Bobbie&#x2019;s Cottontail Ranch, or whatever the nearest brothel might be called.<br><br>In the improbable event that he fails to misinterpret one&#x2019;s inquiry, and/or to take sore offense at it, a dude still isn&#x2019;t likely to further one&#x2019;s cause. For that matter, save for the odd archeologist, neither is anybody else. The population of Nevada arises every morning, straightens its hat, swallows a few aspirin, and trucks off to try to strike it rich without so much as a nervous suspicion that the Canyon of the Vaginas lies within its domain.<br><br>Your pilgrim learned of it from a Salt Lake City artist who has hiked and camped extensively in the high deserts of the Great Basin. The man drew me a fairly specific map, but I, in good conscience, cannot pass along the details. My reluctance to share is rooted neither in selfishness nor elitism, but in the conviction that certain aspects of the canyon are quite fragile and in need of protection.<br><br>Not that genuflecting hordes are likely to descend upon it: the canyon is remote; troubled, according to season, by killer sun, ripping wind, and blinding blizzard; and is reached by a road that nobody making monthly car payments should even think of driving. Still, there are plenty of new-agers with the leisure and energy to track down yet another &#x201c;power center,&#x201d; and plenty of curiosity seekers with an appetite for the exotic souvenir. Surely I&#x2019;ll be forgiven if I&#x2019;m ever so slightly discreet.<br><br>Besides, what kind of pilgrimage would it be if it didn&#x2019;t contain some element of hardship and enigma? The quest is essential to the ritual. To orient ourselves at the interface of the visible and invisible worlds&#x2014;which may be the purpose of all pilgrimages&#x2014;we must embrace the search as well as its goal. If our journey into the heart (or vagina) of meaning resembles in any appreciable manner our last trip to the shopping mall, we&#x2019;re probably doing something wrong.<br><br>I can disclose this much: to arrive at the Canyon of the Vaginas, your pilgrim had to travel a ways on Highway 50, a blue guitar string of asphalt accurately described by postcards and brochures as the Most Lonesome Road in America. It will impress some readers as poignantly correct that so many vaginas are reached only by a route of almost legendary loneliness. Others won&#x2019;t have that reaction at all.<br><br>***********<br><br>Physically, my pilgrimage commenced in downtown Seattle. Downtown Seattle has long been my &#x201c;stomping grounds,&#x201d; as they say, although in the past couple of years it&#x2019;s lost its homey air. A side effect of Reaganomics was skyscraper fever. Developers, taking advantage of lucrative tax breaks, voodoo-pinned our city centers with largely unneeded office towers. In downtown Seattle, for some reason, most of the excess buildings are beige. Seattleites complain of beige � vu: the sensation that they&#x2019;ve seen that color before.<br><br>In any case, it was in a Seattle parking lot, flanked by beige edifices, that I exchanged cars with my chiropractor. He took my customized Camaro Z-28 convertible, a quick machine whose splendid virtues do not include comfort on long-distance hauls; I took his big, new Mercedes.<br><br>If, indeed, the reader should decide to motor to Nevada and it proves to exceed an afternoon&#x2019;s jaunt, may I suggest swapping cars with a chiropractor? Chiropractors&#x2019; cars are not like yours or mine. Theirs tend to be massage parlors on wheels, equipped with the latest breakthroughs in therapeutic seating, lumbar cushions, and vertebrae-aligning headrests. It&#x2019;s like rolling along in a technological spa. The driver can get a spinal adjustment and a speeding ticket simultaneously.<br><br>So relaxed was I in that tea-green Mercedes that I didn&#x2019;t look around when I heard my chiropractor burn a quarter inch of rubber off the Camaro&#x2019;s tires. In a certain way, it was reminiscent of the movie Trading Places. As the good doctor tore off to drag sorority row at the University of Washington, I oozed through the beige maze with a serene, chiropractic smile, braking tenderly in front of Alexa&#x2019;s apartment, and then in front of Jon&#x2019;s.<br><br>For days to come, the three of us, Alexa, Jon, and your pilgrim, would take turns piloting the doctor&#x2019;s clinical dreamboat along tilting tables of rural landscape. Once we&#x2019;d crossed the tamed Columbia and were traversing the vastness of eastern Oregon, once we were out of the wet zone and into the dry zone, out of the vegetable zone and into the meat zone, out of the fiberglass-shower-stall zone and into the metal-shower-stall zone, we would glide through a seemingly endless variety of ecosystems, most of them virtually relieved of the more obvious signs of human folly, all of them unavoidably gorgeous.<br><br>Some of the hills were shaped like pyramids, others resembled the contents of Brunhilde&#x2019;s bodice. One was so vibrantly purple-black that we suspected we&#x2019;d discovered the mother lode where eye shadow was mined. There were craters and slumps, stacks and slides, alkali lakes and sand dunes, gorges and passes, fossil beds, dust devils, and enormous ragged buttes that could have been cruise ships for honeymooning trolls. We followed chatty little creeks, spilling their creek guts to anybody who&#x2019;d listen; we swerved to miss antelope, reduced dead jackrabbits to two dimensions, honked at happy dogs and range steers, photographed gap-toothed windmills and churches in which no collection plate would ever circulate again, inhaled sage until our sinuses gobbled, and cast self-righteous judgment on the bored adolescent gunmen and beered-up Cattle Xing terrorists who&#x2019;d blown a Milky Way of holes into each and every road sign.<br><br>It delighted me that the Canyon of the Vaginas was out here smack dab in the middle of the Wild American West. How swell that in the Old West of gunfights and land grabs, massacres and gold rushes, bushwhackings and horsewhippings, missions, saloons, boot hills, and forts, there existed a culture that celebrated with artistic eloquence and spiritual fervor the most intimate feature of the feminine anatomy.<br><br>Imagine Custer&#x2019;s cavalry troop thundering innocently over a ridge, only to come face-to-face with (gasp!) the pink, the moist, the yielding, the delicately curly. Imagine a Saturday matinee: Roy Rogers at the Canyon of the Vaginas.<br><br>Mentally, emotionally, my pilgrimage began back in my late twenties or early thirties, whenever it was that it first occurred to me that the female genitals were literally divine. In the Orient, especially in the religious systems of Tibet and India, that notion has prevailed since dimmest antiquity, and as a matter of fact, there are yonic symbols in the caves of Paleolithic Europe (dating back twenty thousand years) that are indistinguishable from those venerated today by the tantric cults of the Himalayas.<br><br>When I read how, among the practitioners of tantra, the vulva is adored as the organ for the generation of world and time, it struck a resonant chord. From that day on, I have been seeking the American tantra, which is to say, I&#x2019;ve been seeking American images that promote that inner intensity of feminine sexuality, whose source is the Goddess of Creation.<br><br>Among the examples that have caught my attention are the bubblegum-colored underpants that Bonnie Parker left behind to taunt the cops when she and Clyde Barrow flew the coop. I was convinced, you see, that the American tantra must be as different from the Asian tantra as we Americans&#x2014;sweet gangsters at heart&#x2014;are different from pious Asians. In the modern sense, I still think that&#x2019;s true, but until I learned of the Canyon of the Vaginas, I&#x2019;d neglected to consider the tantric contribution of American Indians.<br><br>Having meditated on and received inspiration from such ostensibly profane icons as Bonnie&#x2019;s panties (she purchased them, by the way, at a small-town Kansas dime store in 1934), it fazed me only a smidgen to discover that what may be the ultimate tantric tribute on our continent is located in west-central Nevada. Even that trace of skepticism vanished when I remembered that the Goddess of Creation also serves as the Goddess of Destruction.</p><h2>A Baghdad Cookery Book (Petits Propos Culinaires)</h2><p>For centuries, it had been the favourite Arabic cookery book of the Turks. The original manuscript, formerly held in the library of the Aya Sofya Mosque, is still in Istanbul; it is now MS Ayasofya 3710 in the S�leymaniye Library. At some point a Turkish sultan commissioned very a handsome copy, now MS Oriental 5099 in the British Library in London. At a still later time, a total of about 260 recipes were added to Kit�b al Tab�kh's original 160 and the expanded edition was retitled Kit�b Wasf al-Atima al-Mutada (my translation of it also appears in Medieval Arab Cookery); three currently known copies of K.Wasf survive, all in Turkey two of them in the library of the Topkapi Palace, showing the Turks&#x2019; high regard for this book. Finally, in the late fifteenth century Sirv�ni made a Turkish translation of Kit�b al Tab�kh, to which he added some recipes current in his own day, the first Turkish cookery book.</p><p>Kit�b al Tab�kh, composed by a thirteenth-century scribe we usually call al-Baghdadi, was long the only medieval Arabic cookery book known to the English-speaking world, thanks to A.J.Arberry&#x2019;s path-breaking 1939 translation as A Baghdad Cookery Book&#x2019; (reissued by Prospect Books in 2001 in Medieval Arab Cookery).</p><h2>Girls Standing on Lawns</h2><p><i>Girls Standing on Lawns</i> is a unique collaboration between renowned artist and bestselling children&#x2019;s book author Maira Kalman and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling writer Daniel Handler, better known as Lemony Snicket. This clever book contains 40 vintage photographs from the collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York, more than a dozen original paintings by Kalman inspired by the photographs, and brief, lyrical texts by Handler. Poetic and thought-provoking, <i>Girls Standing on Lawns</i> is a meditation on memories, childhood, nostalgia, home, family, and the act of seeing. The gorgeous visual material sets the stage for what Handler succinctly describes as &#x201c;a photograph, a painting, a sentence, a pose.&#x201d; Girls, women, families, and even pets from days gone by grace the pages, looking out at us, enticing readers to imagine these people, their lives&#x2014;and where they have gone.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Girls Standing on Lawns</i></b><br> "Kalman supplements the mostly black-and-white, anonymous, amateur snapshots with colorful paintings inspired by the photographs. Handler adds alternately wry, pithy, poignant&#x2014;and always succinct&#x2014;commentary to most spreads, inviting readers to ponder the people and scenes as well as their own family photos."<br> --<i>Booklist<br><br> "</i>Handler provides free verse that is both spare and sparse throughout the collection, contextualizing the thematic groupings and offering imaginative insight into what might have motivated the preservation of such frozen moments. The project is interesting and the images thought provoking."<br> --<i>The Bulletin of The Center for Children&#x2019;s Books</i><br></p><p><b>Maira Kalman </b>is a bestselling and award-winning artist, illustrator, and writer whose books include <i>13 Words</i> (with Lemony Snicket), <i>And the Pursuit of Happiness,</i> and <i>The Elements of Style</i>. Her artwork has been the subject of 14 solo exhibitions and has also been featured in group exhibitions in major museums. <i>Girls Standing on Lawns </i>is the first title in a series of illustrated children&#x2019;s books Kalman will be publishing with MoMA, inspired by MoMA&#x2019;s photography collection. <br> <b>Daniel Handler </b>is the internationally renowned author of the A Series of Unfortunate Events series, whose books have sold over 60 million copies in 44 languages.<br> <b></b>Gr 7 Up&#x2014;Vernacular photography is, as this book describes, photographs taken without artistic ambition. That is what a traditional snapshot is, or in this age of Instagram and digital photography, what it was. Who snapped the photos is unknown. The people and places are long gone, but these photographs of girls standing on lawns remain. Found, anonymous, and removed from their original context, these snapshots have now been given a new life. With text by Handler and paintings by Kalman based on snapshots from collection of the Museum of Modern Art, this is a short, beautiful, and nostalgic book. The spare text ponders the matter-of-factness depicted in the snapshots and the occasional colorful paintings are as playful as the original black-and-white source material. A girl with her arms awkwardly crossed is accompanied by the statement "My whole life I have not known where to put my hands." Another photo of a girl standing on a sidewalk instead of the nearby lawn is accompanied by the answer to the obvious but unasked question, "Because I didn't want to ruin my shoes, is why." The minimal text has the rhythm and simplicity of a children's book, but there is a thought-provoking complexity present that will appeal to teens and adults. This title can also help to inspire creativity, as the idea of using found photographs as the basis for a narrative provides endless possibilities for young adults, teachers, and programming librarians.&#x2014;Billy Parrott, Mid-Manhattan Library, NYPL</p><h2>Love the Home You Have: Simple Ways to...Embrace Your Style *Get Organized *Delight in Where You Are</h2><p>New York Times Bestseller!<br><br>What if the house of your dreams is the home you have?

Four decades later, Temperance Brennan is called to the scene of a drowning in Hemmingford, Quebec. The victim appears to have died while in the midst of a bizarre sexual practice. The corpse is later identified as John Lowery. But how could Lowery have died twice, and how did an American soldier end up in Canada? <br><br>Tempe sets off for the answer, exhuming Lowery&#x2019;s grave in North Carolina and taking the remains to Hawaii for reanalysis&#x2014;to the headquarters of JPAC, the US military&#x2019;s Joint POW/ MIA Accounting Command, which strives to recover Americans who have died in past conflicts. In Hawaii, Tempe is joined by her colleague and ex-lover Detective Andrew Ryan (how &#x201c;ex&#x201d; is he?) and by her daughter, who is recovering from her own tragic loss. Soon another set of remains is located, with Lowery&#x2019;s dog tags tangled among them. Three bodies&#x2014;all identified as Lowery. <br><br>And then Tempe is contacted by Hadley Perry, Honolulu&#x2019;s flamboyant medical examiner, who needs help identifying the remains of an adolescent boy found offshore.

Overhead, a million baby leaves danced in the breeze.<br> <br>Fields spread outward from the orchard in which I stood, their newly turned soil rich and black. The Adirondacks crawled the horizon, gaudy bronze and green in the glorious sunlight.<br> <br>A day made of diamonds.<br> <br>The words winged at me from a war drama I&#x2019;d watched on the classic-film channel. Van Johnson? No matter. The phrase was perfect for the early May afternoon.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m a Carolina girl, no fan of polar climes. Jonquils in February. Azaleas, dogwoods, Easter at the beach. Though I&#x2019;ve worked years in the North, after each long, dark, tedious winter the beauty of Quebec spring still takes me by surprise.<br> <br>The world was sparkling like a nine-carat rock.<br> <br>A relentless buzzing dragged my gaze back to the corpse at my feet. According to SQ Agent Andr� Bandau, now maintaining as much distance as possible, the body came ashore around noon.<br> <br>News telegraphs quickly. Though it was now barely three, flies crawled and swarmed in a frenzy of feeding. Or breeding. I was never sure which.<br> <br>To my right, a tech was taking pictures. To my left, another was running yellow crime-scene tape around the stretch of shoreline on which the body lay. The jackets of both said Service de l&#x2019;identit� judiciaire, Division des sc�nes de crime. Quebec&#x2019;s version of CSI.<br> <br>Ryan sat in a squad car behind me, talking to a man in a trucker cap. Lieutenant-d�tective Andrew Ryan, Section des crimes contre la personne, S�ret� du Qu�bec. Sounds fancy. It&#x2019;s not.<br> <br>In la Belle Province, crime is handled by local forces in major cities, by the provincial police out in the boonies. Ryan is a homicide detective with the latter, the SQ.<br> <br>The body was spotted in a pond near the town of Hemmingford, forty-five miles south of Montreal. Hemmingford. Boonies. SQ. You get it.<br> <br>But why Ryan, a homicide dick working out of the SQ&#x2019;s Montreal unit?<br> <br>Since the deceased was plastic-wrapped and wearing a rock for a flipper, the local SQ post suspected foul play. Thus the bounce to Ryan.<br> <br>And to me. Temperance Brennan, forensic anthropologist.<br> <br>Working out of the Laboratoire de sciences judiciaires et de m�decine l�gale in Montreal, I do the decomposed, mummified, mutilated, dismembered, and skeletal for the province, helping the coroner with identification, cause of death, and postmortem interval.<br> <br>Immersion leaves a corpse in less than pristine condition, so when Ryan caught the call about a floater, he enlisted me.<br> <br>Through the windshield I saw Ryan&#x2019;s passenger gesture with agitated hands. The man was probably fifty, with gray stubble and features that suggested a fondness for drink. Black and red letters on his cap declared I Love Canada. A maple leaf replaced the traditional heart icon.<br> <br>Ryan nodded. Wrote something in what I knew was a small notebook.<br> <br>Refocusing on the corpse, I continued jotting in my own spiral pad.<br> <br>The body lay supine, encased in clear plastic, with only the left lower leg outside and exposed. Duct tape sealed the plastic under the chin and around the left calf.<br> <br>The exposed left foot wore a heavy biker boot. Above its rim, a two-inch strip of flesh was the color of oatmeal.<br> <br>A length of yellow polypropylene rope looped the boot roughly halfway up its laces. The rope&#x2019;s other end was attached to a rock via an elaborate network of knots.<br> <br>The victim&#x2019;s head was wrapped separately, in what looked like a plastic grocery bag. A black tube protruded from one side of the bag, held in place with more duct tape. The whole arrangement was secured by tape circling the neck and the tube&#x2019;s point of exit.<br> <br>What the flip?<br> <br>When I dropped to a squat, the whining went mongo. Shiny green missiles bounced off my face and hair.<br> <br>Up close, the smell of putrefaction was unmistakable. That was wrong, given the vic&#x2019;s packaging.<br> <br>Waving off Diptera, I repositioned for a better view of the body&#x2019;s far side.<br> <br>A dark mass pulsated in what I calculated was the right-thigh region. I shooed the swarm with one gloved hand.<br> <br>And felt a wave of irritation.<br> <br>The right lower was visible through a fresh cut in the plastic. Flies elbowed for position on the wrist and moved upward out of sight.<br> <br>Sonofabitch.<br> <br>Suppressing my annoyance, I shifted to the head.<br> <br>Algae spread among the folds and creases of the bag covering the top and back of the skull. More slimed one side of the odd little tube.<br> <br>I could discern murky features beneath the translucent shroud. A chin. The rim of an orbit. A nose, bent to one side. Bloating and discoloration suggested that visual identification would not be an option.<br> <br>Rising, I swept my gaze toward the pond.<br> <br>Nosed to the shore was a tiny aluminum skiff with a three-horsepower outboard engine. On the floor in back were a beer cooler, a tackle box, and a fishing rod.<br> <br>Beside the skiff was a red canoe, beached and lying on its starboard side. Navigator was lettered in white below the port gunwale.<br> <br>Polypropylene rope ran from a knot on the canoe&#x2019;s midship thwart to a rock on the ground. I noted that the knots on the rock resembled the one securing the victim&#x2019;s ankle weight.<br> <br>Inside the canoe, a paddle lay lengthwise against the starboard hull. A canvas duffel was wedged below the stern seat. A knife and a roll of duct tape were snugged beside the duffel.<br> <br>An engine hum joined the buzz of flies and the bustle and click of techs moving around me. I ignored it.<br> <br>Five yards up the shoreline, a rusted red moped sat beneath a precociously flowering tree. The license plate was unreadable from where I stood. At least with my eyes.<br> <br>Dual rearview mirrors. Kickstand. Raised trunk behind the seat. The thing reminded me of my freshman undergrad wheels. I&#x2019;d loved that scooter.<br> <br>Walking the area between the skiff and the moped, I saw a set of tire treads consistent with the pickup parked by the road, and one tread line consistent with the moped itself. No foot or boot prints. No cigarette butts, aluminum cans, condoms, or candy wrappers. No litter of any kind.<br> <br>Moving back along the water, I continued recording observations. The engine sounds grew louder.<br> <br>Mud-rimmed pond, shallow, no tides or chop. Apple trees within five feet of the bank. Ten yards to a gravel road accessing Highway 219.<br> <br>Tires crunched. The engine sounds cut out. Car doors opened, slammed. Male voices spoke French.<br> <br>Satisfied I&#x2019;d learn nothing further from the scene, and wanting a word with the industrious Agent Bandau, I turned and walked toward the vehicles lining the road.<br> <br>A black van had joined Ryan&#x2019;s Jeep, the blue crime-scene truck, the fisherman&#x2019;s pickup, and Bandau&#x2019;s SQ cruiser. Yellow letters on the van said Bureau du coroner.<br> <br>I recognized the van&#x2019;s driver, an autopsy tech named Gilles Pomerleau. Riding shotgun was my new assistant, Roch Lauzon.<br> <br>Exchanging bonjours, I assured Pomerleau and Lauzon the wait wouldn&#x2019;t be long. They crossed to view the corpse. Ryan remained in the cruiser with the unfortunate angler.<br> <br>I approached Bandau, a gangly twentysomething with a wheat blond mustache and skin that looked like it really hated sun. Though it was hidden by his agent&#x2019;s cap, I envisioned pale hair going south at a rate that alarmed its young owner.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s with the plastic wrap?&#x201d; Bandau asked in French, looking past me toward the corpse.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good question.&#x201d; I had no explanation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Male or female?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Bandau&#x2019;s face came around, winking my reflection off his aviator shades. My expression was not a happy one.<br> <br>&#x201c;I understand you were the first responder.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bandau nodded, eyes unreadable behind the dark lenses.<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d that go?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bandau cocked his chin toward his cruiser. &#x201c;Local named Gripper found the vic. Claims he was fishing when he saw the canoe. He motored over to investigate, something snagged his propeller. Says he paddled in, saw his catch was a corpse, dialed nine-one-one on his cell. While waiting, he dragged the body ashore then retrieved the canoe.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thorough guy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Guess you could say that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is he believable?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>Bandau shrugged. Who knows?<br> <br>&#x201c;What are his creds?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lives on avenue Margaret with his wife. Works maintenance at the wildlife park.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hemmingford is located in the Mont�r�gie region, a hair from the Canada-U.S. border. The Mont�r�gie is noted for apples, maple syrup, and Parc Safari, a combination drive-through nature preserve and amusement park.<br> <br>When I first started commuting to Quebec, the media were following the story of a group of rhesus monkey escapees from the park. I had visions of the band belly-crawling south through the night to avoid border patrol, risking all for a green card and a better life. Twenty years later, the image still amuses me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I caught the call around noon, drove out, secured the area.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And printed the body.&#x201d; Chilly.<br> <br>Sensing my disapproval, Bandau spread his feet and thumb-hooked his belt. &#x201c;I thought it might speed the ID.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You cut the plastic.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wore gloves.&#x201d; Defensive. &#x201c;Look, I had the new camera, so I shot close-ups and transmitted the file electronically.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You compromised the scene.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What scene? The guy was bobbing in a pond.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The flies will chip in to buy you a beer. Especially the ladies. They&#x2019;re ovipositing with glee as we speak.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was trying to help.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You broke protocol.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bandau&#x2019;s lips tightened.<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened with the prints?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I got ridge patterning on all five digits. Someone at the post sent the file to CPIC. From there it went into both NCIC and the New York State system.&#x201d;<br> <br>CPIC is the Canadian Police Information Centre, a computerized index of criminal justice information. NCIC is the U.S. equivalent, the FBI&#x2019;s National Crime Information Center.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why send the prints south?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Being on the border, we get a lot of Americans coming through. And the scooter has a New York plate.&#x201d;<br> <br>Not bad, Bandau.<br> <br>Hearing a car door slam, we both turned.<br> <br>Ryan was walking toward us. Released for the moment, Gripper was leaning on his pickup, looking uneasy.<br> <br>Ryan nodded to Bandau, spoke to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Guy&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Guy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Based solely on size.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tough to say. Given this week&#x2019;s warm temperatures, and the shrink-wrap, I&#x2019;d guess a day or two. There&#x2019;s some decomp, but not much.&#x201d; I cast a meaningful glance at Bandau. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll change now that the bugs have been issued a gate pass.&#x201d;<br> <br>I told Ryan what Bandau had done.<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind of rookie move was that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bandau&#x2019;s cheeks went raspberry.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s no way to make it up the chain, son.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ryan turned back to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Twenty-four to forty-eight hours tracks with the wit&#x2019;s account. Gripper says he comes out here on his days off, usually Tuesdays and Thursdays. Swears day before yesterday the pond was canoe and corpse free.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Algae patterning suggests the body was floating with the head just at or below the waterline,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Ryan nodded. &#x201c;According to Gripper, the body was hanging head up in the water, with the booted foot attached to a rock lying on the bottom. He guesses the pond&#x2019;s about eight feet deep where he found the guy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where was the canoe?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Beside the vic. Gripper says that&#x2019;s how the rope got tangled in his outboard.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ryan spoke to Bandau. &#x201c;Check for feedback on those prints.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ryan and I watched Bandau lope toward his cruiser.<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably DVRs cop shows,&#x201d; Ryan said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not the right ones,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Ryan glanced toward the body, back to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Weird one,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Suicide? Accident? Murder?&#x201d;<br> <br>I spread my palms in a &#x201c;who knows&#x201d; gesture.<br> <br>Ryan smiled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I bring you along.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The vic probably kept the canoe at the pond and drove the moped back and forth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Back and forth from where?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Beats me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep. Can&#x2019;t do without you.&#x201d;<br> <br>A wood thrush trilled overhead. Another answered. The cheerful exchange was in stark contrast to the grim conversation below.<br> <br>As I glanced up, hurried footsteps startled the birds into flight.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got him.&#x201d; Bandau&#x2019;s aviators were now hanging by one bow from his pocket. &#x201c;Cold hit in the States. Thirteen-point match.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ryan&#x2019;s brows may have shot higher than mine.<br> <br>&#x201c;John Charles Lowery. Date of birth March twenty-first, nineteen fifty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not bad, Bandau.&#x201d; This time I said it aloud.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s one problem.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bandau&#x2019;s already deep frown lines deepened.<br> <br>&#x201c;John Charles Lowery died in nineteen sixty-eight.&#x201d;</p><h2>ScrapTherapy� Cut the Scraps!: 7 Steps to Quilting Your Way through Your Stash</h2><p><p>All quilters know one thing for sure: a fabric stash is a living thing.

The new sections include wonderful pictures of historical ironwork (go practice making some of these!) and then the directions that six contemporary smiths are taking. </p><p>I confess that I am one of these smiths, and that I have known the author for years.

Sallie has long dreamed of seeing more of the world, but her parents are reluctant for her to put off baptism yet another summer, and the timing is unfortunate for Perry Zook, who has renewed interest in courting her. <br><br>Though she loves nannying, Sallie has free time on the weekends to enjoy the shore. It is there that she meets Kevin Kreider, a marine biology student who talks freely about all he's learning and asks about her interests, unlike most of the guys she grew up with. Time with Kevin is invigorating, and Sallie realizes she's never felt quite this alive around Perry. Then again, Kevin is Mennonite, not Amish. <br><br>Sallie tries to brush aside her growing feelings for Kevin, but she fears what her parents would think about her new friendship. Just as concerning, however, is Sallie's realization that her time in Cape May is increasing her desire to see the world, challenging her plans for the future. Has she been too hasty with her promises, or will Sallie only find what her heart is longing for back home in Paradise Township?</p><p><b><i>Oh, to see the ocean, </i></b><b>Sallie thought</b><b><i>.

Daniel</b></p> <p> <strong>Q: What's it like working on a huge initiative like <em>The New 52</em>?</strong></p> <p> <strong>Tony S. Daniel: </strong>It was certainly a huge undertaking for me<em>. Detective Comics</em> has never had a relaunch before and it was DC's longest running book. Luckily, Batman is one of the world's most iconic and recognized superheroes ever created. So there wasn't going to be much tinkering on my end. My job was to reacquaint long time readers and new readers alike, using the familiar in a way that it seems fresh.&nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>Q: How are you balancing making these stories and characters feel fresh and new while still respecting what came before?</strong></p> <p> <strong>TSD:</strong> Batman is a character who relies on technology. So luckily, he's a character who has always changed with the times. There's nothing about Batman that is ever outdated because his technology is always more advanced. I chose to introduce new villains for Batman, such as The Dollmaker, and mixing in some old favorites like The Joker and The Penguin.</p> <p> <strong>Q: What would you say defines the character you are working on?</strong></p> <p> <strong>TSD:</strong> Batman is defined by his never ending quest for bringing justice to Gotham City. It's an undertaking that is impossible to achieve, but his will to press on and make Gotham City safer no matter the personal sacrifices he must make keeps Batman, and Bruce Wayne, relatable and admirable.</p> <p> <strong>Q: What stories or creators inspire you most when working on your character?</strong></p> <p> <strong>TSD:</strong> For me, my love of the character started with Frank Miller's <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>. Until then, I had only really experienced Batman through the 60s television show. So seeing Batman gritty, forceful and dark while at the same time contrasting with his personal side made him so much more human, or real, to me. Since then I've been inspired or influenced by all the great artists and writers who have come along these past few decades.</p> <p> <strong>Q: So what do you consider to be your character's definitive stories?</strong></p> <p> <strong>TSD:</strong> As mentioned, <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>, as well classics like <em>The Long Halloween</em>, <em>Hush</em>, and most recently, Grant Morrison's <em>The Black Glove</em> and <em>R.I.P.</em></p> <p> <strong>Q: What have you thought about the response so far for <em>The New 52</em> and your title as whole?</strong></p> <p> <strong>TSD:</strong> I am overwhelmed with the positive reaction. It was a big undertaking, and I thought a big risk, too. But you have to push the envelope with comics. You have to take chances to keep relevant. Growing and evolving is absolutely necessary in the arts.</p> <p> <strong>Q: Do you keep up with any of the other New 52 books? Which ones and why?</strong></p> <p> <strong>TSD:</strong> I keep up with all the Batman titles. I have to since it's part of my job to understand what the other writers are doing. I also have been keeping up with all the other big books like <em>Action Comics, Justice League, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, The Flash</em> and <em>Aquaman</em>. There are too many to list actually, and with my busy schedule, not enough time.</p> <p> <strong>Q: Has social media and increased direct interaction with DC Comics' fans changed your writing/drawing approach at all in regards to <em>The New 52</em>?</strong></p> <p> <strong>TSD:</strong> I use Facebook primarily to connect with readers. I honestly try not to be influenced by outside sources and look mainly to editorial for that. There are so many fans and so many opinions on what they like or don't like. To a degree, I have cut myself off from reading reviews and forums. I think as a creator, you have to work inward--out, not outward--in</p> <p> <strong>Q: What creators have influenced the new direction you've taken with your book?</strong></p> <p> <strong>TSD:</strong> Easily people like Grant Morrison, Frank Miller, Jim Lee, Jeff Loeb, Scott Snyder, Neal Adams, just to name a few. There are so many influences. But beyond comic book authors or artists, my take is influenced by noir and authors like Jim Thompson, one of the early pioneers of the noir style.</p> <p> <strong>Q: So many classic characters have had their looks changed. What has been your favorite character redesign, even if it isn't in your own book?</strong></p> <p> <strong>TSD:</strong> I really like the Wonder Woman redesign. I think it's modern but still has heavy DNA to her roots. I think the redesigns that pay homage to their origins are always the best.</p> <p> <strong>Q: <em>The New 52</em> was a huge success for DC, but how to you think it affected the comic book industry as a whole?</strong></p> <p> <strong>TSD:</strong> I think it gave it a sorely needed shot in the arm. It certainly sparked a lot of interest and I think that credit needs to be given to Dan Didio, Jim Lee, Geoff Johns, and Bob Harras, to name just a few, for the success of <em>The New 52</em>. I am very happy with how this was handled from day one and I'm proud to be a part of it.</p> <p> <strong>Q: With over 75 years of stories, is it difficult discovering new ideas and places for these characters to go that haven't already been done?</strong></p> <p> <strong>TSD:</strong> Well, as a writer, you can't worry so much about what has been done already. Everything has been done already, in every form of storytelling, not just comics. It's how you make it new, your own, and told in a way that it's brand new again, is what's important. With iconic characters such as we're dealing with here, you can't really change them, but you can certainly add a new layer to them. Or accentuate something about them that hasn't been really brought out before. It's a fine line you have to walk because although we're modernizing decades old characters, they still need to be recognizable to both long time readers and new readers alike.</p> <p> <strong>Q: What's it like being a writer and artist on a title? Do you find it easier than working in collaboration with someone else?</strong></p> <strong>TSD:</strong> I'm definitely more in my element when I'm writing for myself. The drafts of the stories I turn in to editorial for approval are what I consider first drafts. Really, it takes about three drafts to get a story right. That's just the natural process for many writers. But this being a time restrictive business, I have to create those second and third drafts in my head while I'm doing the art. When I write for another artist, I don't really get the same opportunity to labor over the ideas. When I turn the script in, it's out of my hands for the most part. So it's a bit harder to bring in a better idea in that case, or to "call an audible" that will improve the story. My preference will always be to write for myself. But I also would like to just be the artist again at some point. I also really enjoy being the visual collaborator for a great story. So at some point I will return to that because it will allow me to focus just on the artwork.Tony S. Daniel decided to be a comics artist in the eighth grade, and he hasn't looked back since. After making his professional debut in 1993 on Comico's <i>The Elementals</i>, he has contributed to Marvel's <i>X-Force</i> and Image's <i>Spawn: Bloodfeud</i> as well as writing and illustrating his own titles <i>Silke, The Tenth</i> and <i>F5</i>, which led him into work in Hollywood. After being lured back into comics to work with writer Geoff Johns on <i>Teen Titans</i>, Daniel went on to draw <i>The Flash</i> before landing his dream job pencilling <i>Batman</i>. The Batcave is, he reports, surprisingly cozy.</p><h2>2 Peter and Jude MacArthur New Testament Commentary (Volume 30) (MacArthur New Testament Commentary Series)</h2><p><p>Second Peter and Jude are sometimes neglected as the "dark corner" of the New Testament.&nbsp;But Christians avoid these two letters to their peril.

The authors explain how MCI is diagnosed and treated and they offer advice on how to improve cognitive health through diet and exercise, through social engagement, and through the use of practical, effective memory strategies. Throughout, case studies illustrate the real-life issues facing people living with MCI. The book includes "Questions to Ask Your Doctor," recommended readings and links to relevant websites, and worksheets to guide readers through healthy lifestyle changes.<br></p><p><br><strong>Nicole D.

Yet Jewish cooking is always changing, encompassing the flavors of the world, embracing local culinary traditions of every place in which Jews have lived and adapting them to Jewish observance. This collection, the culmination of Joan Nathan&#x2019;s decades of gathering Jewish recipes from around the world, is a tour through the Jewish holidays as told in food. For each holiday, Nathan presents menus from different cuisines&#x2014;Moroccan, Russian, German, and contemporary American are just a few&#x2014;that show how the traditions of Jewish food have taken on new forms around the world. There are dishes that you will remember from your mother&#x2019;s table and dishes that go back to the Second Temple, family recipes that you thought were lost and other families&#x2019; recipes that you have yet to discover. Explaining their origins and the holidays that have shaped them, Nathan spices these delicious recipes with delightful stories about the people who have kept these traditions alive. <br><br>Try something exotic&#x2014;Algerian Chicken Tagine with Quinces or Seven-Fruit Haroset from Surinam&#x2014;or rediscover an American favorite like Pineapple Noodle Kugel or Charlestonian Broth with &#x201c;Soup Bunch&#x201d; and Matzah Balls. No matter what you select, this essential book, which combines and updates Nathan&#x2019;s classic cookbooks<i> The Jewish Holiday Baker </i>and <i>The Jewish Holiday Kitchen </i>with a new generation of recipes, will bring the rich variety and heritage of Jewish cooking to your table on the holidays and throughout the year.</p><p>Joan Nathan is the author of eight books, including Jewish Cooking in America, which won the coveted IACP Julia Child Award as Best Cookbook of the Year and also the James Beard Award for Best American Cookbook.

Combine all the ingredients, mixing together thoroughly. Add a little more wine as needed. <br><br> 2. Blend (you can use a food processor) until it reaches the desired consistency. (I like my haroset in large pieces, with a crunchy texture, but my husband's Polish family prefers theirs ground to a paste.) Chill.<br> <b>Passover Roast Lamb<br></b> Serves 6-8 <br><br> One 7-pound shoulder of lamb (see note below) Salt and pepper<br>1 clove garlic, cut in slivers<br>1/2 cup shredded celery leaves<br>1/3 cubed green pepper<br>2 tablespoons tomato sauce, or to taste<br> 1. Preheat the over to 325 degrees. <br><br> 2. Rub the met all over with salt and pepper. Place slivers of garlic in between the bone and the flesh. Place the meat on a rack in a roasting pan, surrounded by celery leaves and green pepper. <br><br> 3. Allowing 20 minutes per pound, roast in the over. About 1 hour before it is done, smooth tomato sauce over the top of the lamb. This will make a crusty skin and all to the flavor of the gravy. <br><br> 4. To make the gravy, first remove the lamb to a warm place and drain off all of the fat. Add a little water to the juices in the pan, leaving in the celery leaves and green pepper, and boil down on top of the stove. Serve with asparagus, roasted new potatoes, and mint jelly. <br> NOTE: A leg of lamb is basically a kosher cut of meat, but it would be extremely laborious and costly for a butcher to cut the many veins in the hind legs of the animal for the blood to run out. For this reason, kosher butchers prefer to sell the shoulder cut.</p><h2>The Vory: Russia&#39;s Super Mafia</h2><p><b>The first English-language book to document the men who emerged from the gulags to become Russia&#x2019;s much-feared crime class: the <i>vory v zakone</i></b><br><br> Mark Galeotti is the go-to expert on organized crime in Russia, consulted by governments and police around the world.

In the book of Acts, church plants begin with sharing the gospel. Planting churches flows naturally out of making disciples. Pastor J. D. Payne explains the process and stages of church planting, with biblical foundations and practical steps for planting teams. He provides a pathway for the multiplication of disciples, leaders and churches. Here are church planting strategies and activities that are simple, highly reproducible and can be implemented by ordinary team members, not just by charismatic leaders. This guide can be used for planting in contexts among any given people group, domestically or internationally. It is an ideal resource for teams to work through together as they follow God&#39;s call in their community.</p><p>J. D. Payne (PhD, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) serves as the pastor of church multiplication for The Church at Brook Hills in Birmingham, Alabama. He has pastored churches in Kentucky and Indiana and served as a seminary professor. His books include <em>Discovering Church Planting, Evangelism, Missional House Churches</em> and <em>Strangers Next Door</em>. He and his wife, Sarah, and their three children live in Birmingham, Alabama."No American alive today has seen church growth keep pace with US population growth. This reality seems to suggest we should stop doing church planting our way. J. D. points back to the simple biblical cycle designed to multiply. Grasping this cycle demands we wrestle with serious questions: Can new churches be formed from new believers? Can new pastors develop and emerge from within new churches? Can faithful church planting include an exit to leave new churches to develop on their own? J. D. Payne not only defends the potential of such notions, he demonstrates the biblical <em>expectation</em> that church planting be done this way." (Nathan Shank, church planting catalyst in Asia, coauthor of The Four Fields of Kingdom Growth)<br><br>"Church planting is not a new concept to many, even in North America. However, the idea of apostolic church planting will be new and novel to many. The idea of teams who start with evangelism, allow those they reach to become a body of believers, focus on growing leaders and do all of this with an eye to leaving represents an old-new idea&#x2015;old as the New Testament, new to us. In a nation that is increasingly hostile to the things of Christ, J. D.'s work is a much-needed call back to a biblical pattern of seeing the church take root among people who do not know him. If you are looking for biblical and practical help in how to mobilize teams of people for church planting, this book is a wonderful resource." (Van Kicklighter, associate executive director, church planting team, Illinois Baptist State Association)<br><br>"In this excellent work, J. D. Payne draws from his experience as a practitioner in the roles of church planter, sponsoring church mission pastor and planter coach to provide timely wisdom for those who are about to begin or are already traversing the church planting journey. Writing as a practitioner, his insights are practical and relevant. As a leading missiologist, his wisdom is well-grounded and trustworthy. In this book, Payne addresses some specific issues not covered in his earlier book, <em>Discovering Church Planting</em>. These two books should be tattered from use, highlighted, dog-eared and at the fingertips of every person leading any church planting endeavor." (Mark Custalow, church planting strategist, central east and southeast Virginia, Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia)<br><br>"In a concise and readable manner, J. D. Payne has written a foundational book for church planters. Whether ministering in North America or around the globe, this is a must-read for anyone who is called to plant churches. For veteran church planters, it could serve as a useful reminder of, and perhaps as an encouragement to recalibrate, the principles of their church-planting ministry." (James Kim, executive director, Pioneers Canada)<br><br>"Church planting must always be grounded in evangelism&#x2015;reaching people who are not yet Christians with the gospel. When church planting degenerates into gathering disaffected Christians or otherwise reshuffling the already-converted into new congregational forms, it really isn't church planting at all! This book clearly articulates a model of true church planting and calls us to fulfill its biblical mandate. Read it and be challenged!" (Jeff Iorg, president, Golden Gate Seminary)<br><br>"Many church planters who would say they follow the apostles' methods fail to see churches multiply as the apostles did. They <em>must</em> read J. D. Payne's <em>Apostolic Church Planting</em>! He graciously points out the shortcomings of conventional church plants in a way that does not appear 'anti,' untying the usual knotty problems and simplifying common complications. I love his phrase, 'Plant the church that is, not the church to come.' Had I read that when I was young, I'd have avoided years of foolishly trying to birth mature churches! You will find these gems throughout the book, but brace yourself to face challenges from Scripture, field experience and testimonies of a healthy number of highly effective practitioners." (George Patterson, church multiplier, author of Church Multiplication Guide, Come Quickly Dawn and Train and Multiply)<br><br>"J. D. Payne strategically shows how sustainable and sanctified apostolic church planting (churches birthed from disciple making) is actually simple, and he skillfully does so without being simplistic." (Tom Steffen, emeritus professor of intercultural studies, Cook School of Intercultural Studies, Biola University)<br><br>"<em>Apostolic Church Planting</em> is less like a how-to manual and more like a clinician's guidebook. It deals with the theology and theory of church planting as well as the practical steps involved. Few missiologists could have written it, but J. D. Payne is one of them. All who are in any way involved in church planting should study this book to be informed. All should read it to be refreshed." (David J. Hesselgrave, professor emeritus of mission, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"Though a rather short book, Payne covers nearly everything you could want to know about evangelism that leads to new churches, from a definition of church planting to ecclesiology to training team members to a description of the stages of church planting and beyond. It's both thorough in scope and thoroughly biblical. . . . Payne gives you a simple, highly reproducible and extensively biblical approach for planting new churches among the planet's most unreached people groups."

How did bands of hunter-gatherers evolve into multinational empires?

In <i>Transcendence</i>, Gaia Vince argues instead that modern humans are the product of a nuanced coevolution of our genes, environment, and culture that goes back into deep time. She explains how, through four key elements -- fire, language, beauty, and time -- our species diverged from the evolutionary path of all other animals, unleashing a compounding process that launched us into the Space Age and beyond.

But that doesn&#x2019;t have to touch the spirit or the energy or the inner resilience.&#x201d; With age comes &#x201c;a kind of tectonic shift in the psyche,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We want to simplify; we want to cultivate our inner life more than we have; there&#x2019;s a call to some of life&#x2019;s deeper questions.&#x201d;<br>Meditation can nurture resilience, she said, and so can an awareness of what she calls the heroic aspect of aging. &#x201c;The later years come along when our energy is declining; we don&#x2019;t have the energy we had when we were 30, 40, or 50. I think it&#x2019;s heroic to deal with what comes to us at a time when we&#x2019;re increasingly impaired,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all about how we live with the challenges that come to us.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Kate Tuttle, <i>Boston Globe</i>, president of the National Book Critics Circle</p></p><h2>Brave Young Knight</h2><p>In this picture book, Karen Kingsbury tells the story of a boy in competition with other young knights to become prince of all the land.

They share an old barn as their creative studio.</p><h2>Patricia St. John Tells Her Own Story</h2><p>Anyone who has read Patricia St. John&#x2019;s books already knows how her stories come alive, and this account of her own life is no exception. Her powers of description make the story leap from the page and the reader is transported to far off places and times; and the people and the things she describes can almost be touched, smelled and seen. Patricia was not just a gifted story-teller, though; she was also a deeply committed follower of the Lord Jesus Christ, whose spiritual journey began when she was only six years old. &#x2018;My name is Patricia, &#x2019; she prayed, &#x2018;and if You are really calling me I want to come and be Yours. &#x2019; Out of that small beginning there issued a river of life and light and blessing that went on increasing right up to the end of her life. Although she always thought of herself as &#x2018;an ordinary sort of girl&#x2019; , her life was extraordinary because of her supreme love for Jesus Christ. The life portrayed here is not that of the self-conscious saint, concerned only with her own saintliness. On the contrary these pages offer us an inside view of someone utterly human, prone to mistakes and failures like the rest of us, yet suffused with the love of God and a contagious joy and peace that was like the bubbling up of a perpetual fountain.</p><p>During her lifetime Patricia St. John authored some 24 books. Two of these, The Tanglewoods&#x2019; Secret and Treasures of the Snow have been continual best-sellers, having been reprinted more than 20 times, and both have been made into films. Her books have also been translated into 40 different languages.</p><h2>Wasteland: The Children of D&#39;Hara, Episode 3 (3)</h2><p><b>The Children of D'Hara picks up immediately after the conclusion of the Sword of Truth series.

Paul Klebnikov pieces together the previous decade in Russian history, showing that a major piece of "the decline of Russia' puzzle lies in the meteoric business career of Boris Berezovsky. <br>Transforming himself from a research scientist to Russia's most successful dealmaker, Berezovsky managed to seize control of Russia's largest auto manufacturer, largest TV network, national airline, and one of the world's biggest oil companies. When Moscow's gangster families battled one another in the Great Mob War of 1993-1994, Berezovsky was in the thick of it. He was badly burned by a car bomb and his driver was decapitated. A year later, Berezovsky emerged as the prime suspect in the assassination of the director of the TV network he acquired. Although plagued by scandal, he enjoyed President Yeltsin's support, serving as the personal financial "advisor" to both Yeltsin and his family. In 1996, Berezovsky organized the financing of Yeltsin's re-election campaign-a campaign marred by fraud, embezzlement, and attempted murder. Berezovsky became the President's most trusted political advisor-playing a key role in forming governments and dismissing prime ministers. <br> Based on hundreds of taped interviews with top businessmen and government officials, secret police reports, contractual documents, and surveillance tapes, Godfather of the Kremlin is both a gripping story and a unique historical document.<br></p><p>Paul Klebnikov tells the incredible story of Boris Berezovsky, a one-time Russian car dealer who assembled a huge--and illicit--fortune after the collapse of Communism. "This individual had risen out of nowhere to become the richest businessman in Russia and one of the most powerful individuals in the country," writes Klebnikov, a respected reporter for <i>Forbes</i>. "This is a story of corruption so profound that many readers might have trouble believing it." Yet <i>Godfather of the Kremlin</i> is a careful work of journalism in which Klebnikov documents the business dealings of a man who once bragged to the <i>Financial Times</i> that he and six other men controlled half of the Russian economy and rigged Boris Yeltsin's reelection in 1996. Berezovsky survived both an assassination attempt and a murder investigation, and paved the way to power for Vladimir Putin. He and the other crony capitalists of post-Soviet Russia like to rationalize their deeds, writes Klebnikov: "Whenever I asked Russia's business magnates about the orgy of crime produced by the market reforms, they invariably excused it by pointing to the robber barons of American capitalism. Russia's bandit capitalism was no different from American capitalism in the late nineteenth century, they argued." Yet nothing could be further from the truth: Carnegie, Rockefeller, and their peers transformed the United States into an economic superpower. Berezovsky, on the other hand, has "produced no benefit to Russia's consumers, industries, or treasury." It's not that he didn't have an opportunity. To pick one example among many, he took over Aeroflot when it had a monopoly position in a booming market. But the company barely grew, and instead experienced myriad problems. Berezovsky controlled many businesses, but he was a lousy business manager; his only authentic success--as an auto dealer--depended on collusion. His real skill is shady dealmaking, especially with corrupt government officials. That's the way to success in modern Russia, as this well-told but troubling book reveals. <i>--John J.

Miller<br><br> In this remarkable, acclaimed history of the development of monotheism, Mark S. Smith explains how Israel's religion evolved from a cult of Yahweh as a primary deity among many to a fully defined monotheistic faith with Yahweh as sole god. Repudiating the traditional view that Israel was fundamentally different in culture and religion from its Canaanite neighbors, this provocative book argues that Israelite religion developed, at least in part, from the religion of Canaan. Drawing on epigraphic and archaeological sources, Smith cogently demonstrates that Israelite religion was not an outright rejection of foreign, pagan gods but, rather, was the result of the progressive establishment of a distinctly separate Israelite identity. This thoroughly revised second edition of<i>The Early History of God</i>&nbsp;includes a substantial new preface by the author and a foreword by Patrick D.

Is it inborn or learned? Can it be chosen&#x2015;or even changed? Does it have to be one or the other? These questions may seem abstract&#x2015;but for parents whose children live outside of gender &#x201c;norms,&#x201d; they are very real.</p><p>No two children who bend the &#x201c;rules&#x201d; of gender do so in quite the same way. Felicia threw away her frilly dresses at age three. Sam hid his interest in dolls and &#x201c;girl things&#x201d; until high school&#x2015;when he finally confided his desire to become Sammi. And seven-year-old Maggie, who sports a boys&#x2019; basketball uniform and a long blond braid, identifies as &#x201c;a boy in the front, and a girl in the back.&#x201d; But all gender-nonconforming children have one thing in common&#x2015;they need support to thrive in a society that still subscribes to a binary system of gender.</p><p>Dr. Diane Ehrensaft has worked with children like Felicia, Sam, and Maggie for over 30 years. In <i>Gender Born, Gender Made,</i> she offers parents, clinicians, and educators guidance on both the philosophical dilemmas and the practical, daily concerns of working with children who don&#x2019;t fit a &#x201c;typical&#x201d; gender mold. She debunks outmoded approaches to gender nonconformity that may actually do children harm. And she offers a new framework for helping each child become his or her own unique, most gender-authentic person.</p></p><p><b>Diane Ehrensaft, PhD,</b>is a developmental and clinical psychologist. At the University of California&#x2013;San Francisco, she is the cofounder and director of mental health at the Child and Adolescent Gender Center, an associate professor of pediatrics, and an attending psychologist at the Benioff Children&#x2019;s Hospital Child and Adolescent Gender Clinic. Her work with&#x2014;and advocacy for&#x2014;gender creative children has been widely covered, including by <i>The New York Times</i>, the <i>Huffington Post</i>, and NPR.

I swear Ehrensaft is the patron saint of kids who don't conform to traditional gender norms. She should be celebrated with a day off from work and school; a Saint Diane medal worn by families with gender-creative loved ones; a mural painted of her portrayed as a Pied Piper type with a gaggle of kids of varying gender representations following happily behind her; or whatever it is good people do to honor their beloved protectors.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;<b>Lori Duron</b> in <i>Raising My Rainbow: Adventures in Raising a Fabulous, Gender Creative Son</i><br><br> &#x201c;This is an outstanding reference&#x2015;an indispensible guide for those providing care for gender-nonconforming youth.

Their strengths are reflected in their stories. This provocative book will be helpful for parents, teachers, and clinicians working with children along the continuum of gender expression.

Building on her vast experience working with children, families, and professionals, she beckons all of us to expand our traditional notions of gender, challenging us to create affirming spaces in which children can discover and celebrate their authentic selves.

Aristotle. Augustine. Hume. Kant. Hegel.</strong> These names and the philosophies associated with them ring through the minds of every student and scholar of philosophy. And in their search for knowledge, every student of philosophy needs to know the history of the philosophical discourse such giants have bequeathed us. Noted philosopher C. Stephen Evans brings his expertise to this daunting task as he surveys the history of Western philosophy, from the Pre-Socratics to Nietzsche and postmodernism&#x2015;and every major figure and movement in between.</p><p>"Few textbook writers have a long and distinguished record of first-rank scholarship, but this one does. Even fewer have been able to write successfully for disciplinary specialists, interested intellectuals, and first-time inquirers, but this one has. Almost none of these can offer the fruit of a lifetime's reflection on philosophy from an informed and discerning Christian viewpoint, but this one can. Steve Evans's new survey is a rare gift, as he himself is, and I trust this book will gain the wide reading it deserves." (John G. Stackhouse Jr., Samuel J. Mikolaski professor of religious studies, Crandall University, Moncton, Canada)<br><br>"We have here an overview of western philosophy from the pre-Socratic philosophers of ancient Greece to the twentieth century. It offers a summary of the basic teachings of the major thinkers we have come to call philosophers that is comprehensive, succinct, lucid, and evenhanded. In addition there are occasional reflections on the significance of the material for Christian thought. Combined with the appropriate primary source readings, this volume will be a very useful textbook for a variety of college level courses." (Merold Westphal, distinguished professor of philosophy emeritus at Fordham University)<br><br>"When a world-class Christian philosopher writes on the history of Western philosophy, one can expect a first-rate work that illuminates and enriches&#x2015;and that is just what we find here. Evans's book effectively distills key philosophical figures and their ideas, considering both their historical context and their lasting influence. What we have in this volume is a marvelous resource that engages key thinkers and philosophical concepts judiciously, insightfully, and Christianly." (Paul Copan, the Pledger Family Chair of Philosophy and Ethics at Palm Beach Atlantic University, author of A Little Book for New Philosophers)<br><br>"Evans's <em>A History of Western Philosophy</em> is a superb instance of its kind, skillfully combining breadth of coverage with insightful philosophical analysis of the ideas and arguments covered. It is accessible enough to be helpful to those who are new to philosophy, yet comprehensive and accurate enough to offer something to graduate students and professors. This book would be especially suitable as the sole secondary text assigned in an introductory philosophy course or in more advanced undergraduate courses in the history of philosophy. It would also be a great resource for clergy and laypeople who are interested in philosophical thought." (Michael Rota, associate professor of philosophy at the University of St. Thomas)<br><br>"C. Stephen Evans has performed a tremendous service for Christian philosophers, especially those new to the field. <em>A History of Western Philosophy</em> is an excellent single-volume history of the progress of western philosophical thought. Dr. Evans hits all the major players, concentrating on the essentials of each philosopher's contribution to the ongoing discussion. His style is clear, lucid, and accessible for the novice while also presenting insightful evaluations for those who are advanced. It is a superb work that should be on the shelf of every thoughtful Christian." (Mark W. Foreman, professor of philosophy and religion at Liberty University)C. Stephen Evans (PhD, Yale) is University Professor of Philosophy and the Humanities at Baylor University. He previously taught in the philosophy departments at Calvin College, St. Olaf College, and Wheaton College.

Now a classic in its own right and translated into other languages (German, Spanish, Portuguese, Croatian, and Italian), the "Guide" is recognized by teachers and long time students of the I Ching as indispensable to its understanding and use. Developed from notes taken over many years, the Guide mirrors the reader's true inner feelings, helping him to bring his life and fate into harmony with the Tao &#x2014; the way of the Universe.</p><p>This book, published first in 1980, is here presented in its third revised and enlarged edition. It remains the best selling I Ching book for its major independent press distributors in the U.S. and England, and it has been translated into German, Spanish, Portuguese, and Croatian. It has attained a dedicated and enthusiastic worldwide following from readers of all interests and backgrounds.I could never have presumed to sit down and write a book on such a wonderful and enormous text as the I Ching. This book simply happened as notes I was keeping for my own use. I wrote the notes during those occasional times when I suddenly realized what the I Ching had been referring to in my daily consulting it. Sometimes these realizations came during the middle of the night; sometimes they came during meditation, or while I was doing something mundane. Always, I felt they were a gift from the Cosmos, for I could not imagine how such wonderful thoughts could come from my mind. They were somehow beyond pure mentality. After seven years these covered every line and hexagram in the I Ching, and when I saw that they were helpful to other users of the I Ching, I published them. Another ten years gave me an even fuller perspective of the underlying principles of the I Ching, and so I shared them in what is here the third edition of the book. I do not offer them as a definitive and final understanding of the I Ching, for I do not believe that such a monumental book of wisdom can be definitively understood. I merely offer it to share what I have myself learned. What I have learned, however, is that the great Tao of the Universe is a friendly consciousness that is always there to help us, so long as we do not block it by negative and arrogant thoughts. To harmonize oneself with its point of view is to find true happiness. It is also a long and ever-engaging process.</p><h2>We Hope for Better Things</h2><p>"In this powerful first novel . . .

He had ridden the Outlaw Trail and could find out things others couldn&#x2019;t. That was why a rich man named Jefferson Henry hired Milo to hunt down a missing girl. But from the moment Milo began his search, he knew something wasn&#x2019;t right. Three people had already died, an innocent woman was on the run, and a once sleepy town was getting crowded with hired guns. Suddenly, Milo Talon realized that there were still things he had to learn&#x2014;about the woman he was trying to find, the man who had hired him, and the murderer who wanted him dead. But most of all, Milo had a few things to learn about himself. And he would have to work fast, because one mistake could cost him his life....</p></p><p>Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour </b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier. There are more than three hundred million copies of his books in print around the world.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>The private car stood alone on a railroad siding bathed in the hot red blood of a desert sunset. Stepping down from the saddle, I tied my horse to the hitching rail, glanced again at the obvious opulence of the car, and took off my chaps and spurs, hanging them from the saddle-horn.<br><br>"Don't fret," I told my horse. "I'll not be long."<br><br>With a whip or two of my hat to brush the worst of the dust from my clothes, I crossed to the car and swung aboard. I paused an instant, then opened the door and stepped into the observation room. All was satinwood and vermilion.<br><br>A table, a carafe of wine, and glasses. A black man wearing a white coat stepped from the passage along the side. "Yes, sir?"<br><br>"I am Milo Talon."<br><br>"A moment, sir."<br><br>He vanished and I stood alone. There was a distant murmur of voices and the black man returned. "This way, sir? If you please?"<br><br>The passage led past the doors of two staterooms to the salon which doubled as a dining room. The room was comfortable but ornate with heavily tassled and fringed draperies, velvet portieres, and thick wall-to-wall carpets.<br><br>Hat in hand I waited, catching a glimpse of myself in the narrow mirrors between the windows. For a moment I was seeing what others might see: a lean, dark young man in a wine-colored shirt, black tie, black coat, and gray pin-striped trousers. Under the coat a gun-belt and a Colt.<br><br>The office compartment into which I was shown was small but beautifully appointed, and the man behind the desk fitted the picture. He was square-shouldered and square-jawed, a man accustomed to command. He might have been sixty or more but seemed younger. His mustache and hair were black with scarcely a hint of gray. He wore a black, beautifully tailored suit. His manners, I felt, were as neatly tailored as his clothing. He gestured to a chair, then opened a box of expensive cigars and offered it to me.<br><br>"No, sir. Thank you, sir."<br><br>"Sit down, won't you?"<br><br>"I'll stand, sir."<br><br>The jaws tightened a little; a short-tempered man, I thought, who does not like to be thwarted in even the smallest thing.<br><br>"I am Jefferson Henry," he said.<br><br>"And I am Milo Talon. You wished to see me?"<br><br>"I wish to employ you."<br><br>"If I like the job."<br><br>"I will pay well. Very well."<br><br>"If I like the job."<br><br>The skin around his eyes seemed to tighten. "You're damned independent!"<br><br>"Yes, sir. Shall we get on with it, sir? What led you to me?"<br><br>"You were referred to me as a man who could do a difficult job, a close-mouthed man, and who if required would charge Hell with a bucket of water."<br><br>"Well?"<br><br>He did not like me. It was in his mind, I think, to tell me to leave, to get out. Something else was in his mind also because he did nothing of the kind.<br><br>"I want you to find someone for me. I want you to find a girl."<br><br>"You will have to find your own women." I started to put on my hat.<br><br>"The girl is my son's daughter. She has been missing for twelve years."<br><br>A moment longer I hesitated, then sat down. "Tell me about it."<br><br>"Fifteen years ago my son and I quarreled. He went west. I have not seen or heard from him since."<br><br>"Have you any idea," I asked, "how many men are simply swallowed up by this country? Men drop from sight every day and no one takes notice. Usually, nobody cares. I have helped to bury several. No names, no other means of identification, no hint as to origin or destination. Some are killed by thieves or Indians, some die of thirst, cholera, or accident."<br><br>"No doubt, but my son had a daughter. It is she whom I hope to find."<br><br>"And not your son?"<br><br>"He is dead." Jefferson Henry bit the end from a cigar. "My son was weak. He was bold enough when telling me to go to Hell, but he had done that several times and had always come back. If he was alive he would have done so again, so I know he is dead."<br><br>"What of his wife? The girl's mother?"<br><br>Henry lit the cigar. "It was she we quarreled over. I have no wish to see her. I am not interested in her. I wish only to find my son's daughter."<br><br>He paused, considering the glowing end of the cigar. Then he said, "I am a very rich man. I am no longer young. I have no other heir, and I am alone. She must be found."<br><br>"And if she is not found? Who inherits then?"<br><br>His eyes were cold. "We will not discuss that. You are to find my granddaughter. You will be well paid."<br><br>"Your son disappeared fifteen years ago?"<br><br>"He married despite my wishes. He took his wife and their daughter and went west, working for a time in Ohio then in St. Louis." Jefferson Henry brushed the ash from his cigar.<br><br>"The daughter may not have lived."<br><br>"Of course. That is a contingency for which I am prepared."<br><br>"Or she may have become somebody whom you may not wish to claim."<br><br>"That is a possibility."<br><br>"Why me?"<br><br>"You have been mentioned to me as a man who knows the west. You were a scout for the Army. You were mentioned as a man of perception and intelligence." He paused. "It was also said that you had acceptance along the Outlaw Trail."<br><br>"Oh?"<br><br>"I might add--I knew your father."<br><br>"You knew him?"<br><br>"He was a hard-headed, opinionated, difficult man, but he was honest. We agreed on almost nothing, but once set upon a course he could not be turned aside."<br><br>"You were his friend?"<br><br>Jefferson Henry brushed the ash from his cigar. From under his thick brows his eyes were like blue ice. "I was not. Our dislike was immediate and mutual. It remained so. But I did not come two thousand miles to talk of him. When I hire a man I try to get the best man for the job. You were recommended."<br><br>He opened a drawer of the desk where he sat and took out a sack of gold coins. At least, by their apparent weight I judged they were gold. "There is one thousand dollars. I do not demand an itemized account of your expenses, only a general coverage. I understand that in such situations moneys often have to be expended that are better not accounted for."<br><br>From another drawer he took a large manila envelope. "This contains copies of letters, old photographs, some memoranda. It is all I have."<br><br>"You have been trying to find her?"<br><br>"Everything failed. Even the Pinkertons."<br><br>For a few minutes I considered it. There was something here I did not like, yet I could not put a finger on it for he seemed straightforward enough, yet every instinct told me the man was not to be trusted. Nonetheless, the problem fascinated me and I was foot-loose . . . and broke. Or nearly so.<br><br>"All right. If she is alive I will find her. If she is dead, I will know where she was buried."<br><br>"You will find her? Where others failed?"<br><br>"Why not? You would not have come to me if you did not believe I could find her."<br><br>He gave me that straight, hard look again. "I believe nothing of the kind. You are, however, my last chance." He indicated the envelope. "My address is there, or you may find me through any Wells Fargo office. If you need more money you may go to any Wells Fargo office and draw up to one thousand dollars. If you need more than that, you must contact me personally."<br><br>"Up to how much?"<br><br>"Fifty thousand dollars. I am prepared to spend that much and no more."<br><br>It was a lot of money, an awful lot of money. I said as much.<br><br>He waved a hand. "It is. But she is the heir to all I have. If she is not my only living relative, as I believe, she is at least the only one whom I care to acknowledge."<br><br>"If I accept, what will I be paid?"<br><br>Jefferson Henry indicated the sack of gold. "Your expenses will be paid. I shall pay you one hundred and fifty dollars a month during the term of your employment and a bonus of one thousand dollars if you find her."<br><br>"Two hundred a month," I said.<br><br>His eyes showed impatience. "You ask for two hundred? You've worked as a cowpuncher for thirty dollars a month!"<br><br>"This is not cowpunching." I got to my feet. "It is two hundred or no deal. The money to be paid to my account at the Wells Fargo office in El Paso."<br><br>He hesitated, not liking it or me, but finally he said, "All right, two hundred it is."<br><br>"In advance."<br><br>He took gold coins from another drawer and paid them over the desk. "See that you earn it."<br><br>Leaving the car, envelope in hand, I was puzzled. Stepping down from the car, I crossed to my horse. What was bothering me? It seemed a fairly straightforward proposition, although searching for missing persons had never been something for which I was noted.<br><br>Glancing back toward the car, I was startled to see another man in the salon where I had just been. He was standing close to Jefferson Henry and they were talking, gesturing. He was a tall, wide-shouldered man, larger than Henry, who was not a small man.<br><br>It was not the porter.<br><br>Now then, who was he? And where had he been during my talk with Henry?<br><br>If I'd learned one thing during my knockabout years it was that a man lives only through awareness, and it irritated me that I had not known of the man's presence.<br><br>Who was this other man? What was he? Had he been listening?<br><br>Why, after so many years, was Henry only now trying to locate his son's daughter? Pinkertons, he said, had failed. Why hire me, of all people?<br><br>Was it because they knew I had friends along the Outlaw Trail? Or did they believe, because of that, that I was an outlaw? Or did he have some reason to suspect that I already knew something about the girl? Suppose some of the clues the Pinkertons had found led to me?<br><br>But how could they? Certainly, I knew a few girls here and there, and of some of them I knew next to nothing of their history.<br><br>That the Pinkertons knew me I was fully aware, for they had a line on all who followed the Outlaw Trail and I'd been approached some time back as a possible agent.<br><br>Mounting, I turned my horse toward the town's one street. The railroad station, which was about a hundred yards from where the private car stood on its siding, was a two-story structure standing a few yards back of the street. The station had an overhanging roof on each story shading the windows from the glare of the sun.<br><br>From the private car a good view might be had of most of the street. On that side of the street which lay closest to the depot there were but three buildings, one of them a store, another a saloon. The third was empty.<br><br>On the facing street there were a dozen buildings including the hotel, restaurant, another general store, a livery stable, blacksmith shop, and an assortment of small shops and offices.<br><br>Leaving the hostler with two bits to give my horse a bait of oats and a rubdown, I took my Winchester and saddlebags and started up the street to the hotel.<br><br>It was suppertime in town and few people were about. A stray dog lying in the dusty street wagged his tail a few times, asking not to be disturbed, and several horses stood three-legged at the hitching rail. A cigarette glowed momentarily from a dark doorway of the empty building and I felt the weight of the gold I now carried. Winchester in my right hand, I pushed open the door and stepped into the lobby. It was a spacious, high-ceilinged room with a pillar in the center surrounded by a leather cushioned settee. There were several cowhide chairs and another settee against the far wall. Several large brass cuspidors offered themselves at strategic spots. Behind the counter was a man with a green eyeshade and sleeve garters. He was a pinch-faced man with a mustache too big for his face.<br><br>"A room," I suggested.<br><br>Red mustache glanced at me with sour distaste. He had seen a lot of cowhands. "Got one bed left in a room for three. Cost you a quarter."<br><br>"A room," I repeated, "a single room . . . alone."<br><br>"Cost you fifty cents," he spoke carelessly, expecting me to refuse.<br><br>My palm left a half-dollar on the counter. "Just give me the key," I said.<br><br>"No key. Folks just pack them off." He indicated the stairway. "Up and to your right. Corner room. You can put a chair under the doorknob if you figure it's needed."<br><br>"I sleep light," I said, "and I'm skittish. Too much time in Indian country. If you hear a shot in the night you come up and pack somebody away."<br><br>He gave me a bored look and started to resume his newspaper.<br><br>"Where's the best place to eat?"<br><br>"Three doors down. Maggie's Place. She won't be in this time of night but the cook's one of the best."<br><br>Whether it was the fact that I paid fifty cents for a room or his conversation about the cook that warmed him up, I didn't know, but the clerk was suddenly talkative.<br><br>He glanced at the register. "Talon? Ain't that some kind of a claw?"<br><br>"It is. An ancestor of mine taken it for a name because he had a claw where his right hand should have been. Scratched a lot of folks here and there. Or so I've heard."<br><br>He thought I was joking but I was not. Every Talon knew the story of that hard, bitter old man who started the family. It was a long time back and to most of us a few stories were all that remained, although there was rumor of property still in Talon hands and treasure buried here and there.<br><br>"Be around long?" he asked.<br><br>"Day or two." I paused. It was always better to provide a reason so they wouldn't worry about it. "I've been workin' all summer. Figured it was time to rest up a bit." They might, of course, have seen me leave the private car, so I added, "Not that I'd turn down a good job if it showed itself. I've been askin' around. Like to get me a job guidin' hunters or such-like. Seemed like the folks in that car yonder might want a guide but they don't. They don't want nothing.

But learning to recognize God's voice and the many ways in which He speaks is vital for following His plan. In <i>How to Hear from God</i>, Joyce Meyer shows readers that God reaches out to people every day, seeking a partnership with them to offer guidance and love. She reveals the ways in which God delivers His word and the benefits of asking God for the sensitivity to hear His voice. Joyce asks the question, "Are you listening?" and shares how to do just that.</p><p>Joyce Meyer has been teaching the Word of God since 1976 and in full-time ministry since 1980. She is the #1 <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author of more than seventy inspirational books. She has also released thousands of audio teachings as well as a complete video library. Joyce's ENJOYING EVERYDAY LIFE radio and television programs are broadcast around the world, and she travels extensively conducting conferences. Joyce and her husband, Dave, are the parents of four grown children and make their home in St. Louis, Missouri. You can visit her at www.joycemeyer.org. <br>No-nonsense, best-selling author and Bible teacher Meyer explores the various modes God uses to communicate with his listening followers in this book geared for charismatic Christians. While most Christians would agree that the primary vehicle God utilizes to speak to believers is the Bible, Meyer adds several others that may raise eyebrows among conservative evangelicals. She asserts that devout Christians can and do hear from God via dreams, visions, an audible voice and what Meyer calls an "inner witness" that parallels the still, small voice mentioned in Scripture. She aims to encourage Christians to listen well, as she believes that very few followers of Christ ever fulfill God's perfect plan because they haven't perceived God's directives for their lives. Detailing various obstacles to hearing from God, Meyer candidly shares her own battles with busyness before expounding upon the dangers of rote religious activity, stubborn hard-heartedness, worldly viewpoints, unforgiveness and legalism. Finally, she offers the cure for these ills: the grace of God that brings blessed freedom and restoration. Meyer's trademark plainspoken style carries through here; as a spirit-filled spokesperson for God, she writes her words in the same style she would speak them. Some Christians may wonder about her tendency toward "verse claiming"-the many instances where she thinks God is speaking directly to her through a message or lesson given to some biblical character. However, fans of Meyer's previous works will likely be delighted with this newest offering, and its back-to-basics approach will ensure new fans as well.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Des Pawson&#39;s Knot Craft and Rope Mats: 60 Ropework Projects Including 20 Mat Designs</h2><p><p>This wonderful collection of Des Pawson's personal ropecraft recipes combines an extended and now full-color collection of projects from Des's popular <i>Des Pawson's Knot Craft</i>, together with 20 new and brilliant mat designs.</p><p>Readers can learn how to make 60 different ropework projects, including mats, bellropes, key fobs, fenders, and doorstops.

The persuasive power of an odor cannot be fended off, it enters into us like breath into our lungs, it fills us up, imbues us totally. There is no remedy for it.</p><p>&#x2014;PATRICK S�SKIND, Perfume</p><p>Egyptians emptied corpses of their organs and filled the cavities with aromatics to prepare them for the afterlife. Romans splashed doves with rose water and set them loose in banquet halls to scent the air. Marie Antoinette employed her own perfumer, Jean-Louis Fargeon, who created bespoke perfumes to match the queen&#x2019;s many moods. People have feasted on aromatic materials, scented temples with them, offered them to guests. Whatever the vehicle&#x2014;flowers or food, incense or perfume&#x2014;people in every time and place have gone out of their way to exercise and indulge the sense of smell. Why? Because no other sense makes us feel so fully alive, so truly human, so deeply, unconsciously, and immediately connected with our memories and experiences. No other sense so moves us.</p><p>As an artisanal perfumer who works with extraordinary aromatic ingredients from all over the world, I venture deep into the fragrant world every day. And one of my greatest joys is bringing other people there, too, and watching as they immerse themselves in the experience. Scent is fun, sexy, visceral, transporting: it reminds us who we are and connects us to one another and to the natural world. Of all the senses, the sense of smell is the one that reaches most readily beyond us, even as it most powerfully taps the wellsprings of our inmost selves. It has an unparalleled capacity to wake us up, to make us fully human.</p><p>In The Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde portrays the deep, instinctive connection between scent and our unconscious thoughts and emotions:</p><p>And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums from the East. He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one&#x2019;s passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers; of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul.</p><p>Wilde knows that aromas can take us anywhere, that they are a magic carpet we can ride to hidden worlds, not only to other times and places but deep within ourselves, beneath the surface of daily life. We close our eyes&#x2014;we do this instinctively before we inhale a scent, as if preparing for the internal journey&#x2014;and before we even consciously recognize what we&#x2019;re smelling, we are carried away without our consent. Or we are stopped in our tracks, brought entirely into the present moment. (The next time you catch a whiff of skunk, try thinking about anything else at all.)</p><p>I&#x2019;ll never forget the first time I smelled the intense aromatic essences that are the perfumer&#x2019;s palette. I had signed up for a perfume class at a nearby aromatherapy studio. The teacher laid out many small bottles of naturally derived botanical essences for us to compose with: oakmoss, angelica, jasmine, frankincense, patchouli, kewda, sweet orange, lime. I leaned over to smell each one, amazed at how rich and complex and singular and stinky and alive they were, how transporting. As I took in the oils, in all their gorgeous diversity, it was as if a mirrored sensation were occurring inside me; I felt as if I were becoming one with the oils, as if they were entering me. I couldn&#x2019;t tell where I left off and they began. I couldn&#x2019;t and didn&#x2019;t want to find the words to describe them; I just felt radiant and alive&#x2014;as radiant and alive as they were. I fell in love immediately.</p><p>By then I&#x2019;d already lived for more than twenty years in Berkeley, California, where I had a thriving psychotherapy practice and had written a few books. The city itself had had a profound influence on me from the moment I arrived there, after an upbringing in Detroit. In Berkeley, I found the bohemian ambience I had longed for, an energy that was palpable in the streets, in the restaurants and caf�s and shops. It felt as if behind every Arts and Crafts fa�ade there were people making pottery or jewelry, writing books, doing improv, inventing new recipes, collaborating in a kind of rampant cross-fertilization of creativity.</p><p>As it happened, I moved into an Arts and Crafts house right behind the restaurant Chez Panisse, where Alice Waters had just begun to spread the gospel of locavorism. Three houses down was the original Peet&#x2019;s Coffee, where Mr. Peet himself roasted the beans. My block was redolent with the smells of fresh coffee and of vegetables roasting in Chez Panisse&#x2019;s wood-fired oven. In Detroit, front yards had been clipped, manicured, rolled-lawn affairs, but here in Berkeley people&#x2019;s front yards overflowed with casual cottage gardens of fresh herbs and heritage roses, fruit trees in bloom, jasmine and wisteria climbing from basement to attic. I had never seen such a gift to the street! Despite Berkeley&#x2019;s reputation as the epicenter of the counterculture, the aesthetic it was steeped in was simple, almost Old World. It spoke to me, and it played a great role in shaping my own aesthetic. Working with the best ingredients, doing only what needed to be done and no more&#x2014;this became my creative mantra.</p><p>It was a mantra that guided me through several career turns, fueled by the Berkeley milieu. As a weaver I worked with a range of natural materials&#x2014;horsehair, goat hair, wool, silk&#x2014;learning to spin them into yarn, and dyeing them with herbs and lichens I gathered. I developed an appreciation for the ways that raw materials were grown, processed, and used all over the world. Later I trained to be a therapist and focused my practice on artists and writers, to whose brilliance and creative energy I was drawn. Researching a book I was writing on Brian Jones, founding member of the Rolling Stones, I was drawn to his fascination with the costumes and music of other cultures, and to the way he embodied the conviction that anything is possible and that creativity is what life is all about.</p><p>I wrote another book, The Story of Your Life, marrying my fascination with plot and narrative to what I had learned about character and transformation through my years as a therapist. Then I decided to write a novel, with a perfumer as my protagonist. I knew nothing about the craft of perfumery, but its aura had allure. I signed up for that perfume class, little dreaming that in the process of researching my novel I was about to discover my true calling and become the artist I had only planned to write about.</p><p>Not only did I fall in love with essential oils, but I discovered that I had a knack for blending them. Just as sometimes you meet someone it seems you&#x2019;ve known forever, the essences, with their distinct personalities, had a mysterious familiarity to me. I could appreciate their textures and shapes almost instinctively, like a language in which I was already fluent. As I started making perfumes, I could identify where and how I&#x2019;d made mistakes, and in correcting them I learned so much about the way each essence interacted with others. I set up my own perfume business, a true cottage industry. Gradually I developed a following for my artisanal fragrances, developed from entirely natural materials that I sourced from all over the world.</p><p>At the same time, I immersed myself in the rich history of scent, acquiring more than two hundred rare and antique books on perfumery, one book leading me to the next as I fell under the spell of their charm, beauty, and eccentricity. Discovering the universe they contained was like being the first explorer in a cave that harbored the unsullied pottery and intact arrowheads of a lost civilization. In the stories of perfume, one could relive the world being discovered, retrace the footsteps of the people who came upon spices in faraway places and learned to extract the aromatic oils from exotic plants. In their intricate woodcuts and engravings, old distilling apparatuses looked like crosses between lab equipment and the tools of witchcraft. It wasn&#x2019;t just the history of perfume I was discovering. I had entered a heady world in which perfume commingled with medicine, science, alchemy, cooking, mysticism, cosmetics, and craft. There lay the richer, more synesthetic sensibility of a bygone time, a beautiful and mysterious universe of magical things jumbled together.</p><p>Eventually I did write another book of my own, not a novel but Essence and Alchemy: A Natural History of Perfume, which introduced perfumers and &#x201c;perfumistas&#x201d; to the sensual history of natural aromatics and the building blocks of creating perfume with them. The nascent natural/artisanal perfumery movement embraced the book, and I began to teach the art of perfumery as well as to practice it. I also began to confer and collaborate with chefs and mixologists who were coming at natural essences via food and drink. I found myself in the vanguard of a surge of interest in scent as a key component of flavor, an exciting new arena I explored in a cookbook I coauthored with Michelin two-star chef Daniel Patterson.</p><p>In my nearly two decades of peregrinations through the world of scent, the wonder of encountering amazing new fragrances has never left me. And everywhere I&#x2019;ve gone, I&#x2019;ve had the joy of giving other people that experience. Sometimes they try to head me off, claiming they are &#x201c;not into perfume.&#x201d; Instinctively repelled by their exposure to an olfactory diet that&#x2019;s the equivalent of fast food&#x2014;the assaultive, artificial scents that saturate what we eat, our cleaning products, mass-produced perfume, the very environment&#x2014;they&#x2019;ve come to believe they have no appetite for scent itself. Watching them discover authentic aromas and their sensual pleasures is profoundly thrilling, like watching a starving person feast on a delicious meal. It&#x2019;s these experiences of reawakening people to scent that led to this book. I wanted to write next for everyone, not just for the perfumers and perfumistas&#x2014;though I think they too will find new information and inspiration here, as their passionate interest in high-quality perfumes has fueled the trend toward niche brands and small-batch perfumery.</p><p>As Michael Taylor observes in Rembrandt&#x2019;s Nose, that great painter intuitively understood that the nose was the key to understanding a person&#x2019;s face. He painted noses that &#x201c;possess a will of their own.&#x201d;</p><p>They have their own inclinations and seem to obey their own promptings rather than the laws of objective resemblance. They are long and slender, flat and squat, smooth or wrinkled, bony or fleshy, dainty or gross, pitted, scarred, inflamed, unblemished&#x2014;less, one feels, for reasons of fidelity to the sitter than for reasons dictated by the artist. . . . He rendered the complexion of a nose with the same fastidiousness that he brought to paraphrasing the sheen of velvet or fur. In his portraits and self-portraits, he angles the sitter&#x2019;s face in such a way that the ridge of the nose nearly always forms the line of demarcation between brightly illuminated and shadowy areas. A Rembrandt face is a face partially eclipsed; and the nose, bright and obvious, thrusting into the middle of halftones, serves to focus the viewer&#x2019;s attention upon, and to dramatize, the division between a flood of light&#x2014;an overwhelming clarity&#x2014;and a broody duskiness.</p><p>I feel a bit about the nose as Rembrandt evidently did. The nose is idiosyncratically central not only to our sense of smell but to our sense of who we are, in our most primal appetites. For the idea of appetite pertains to food as well as to all the sensual and spiritual experiences that drive us, give us pleasure, make us feel more alive in the moment. Scent is a portal to these basic human appetites&#x2014;for the far-off, the familiar, the transcendent, the strange, and the beautiful&#x2014;that have motivated us since the origins of our species.</p><p>As I researched and thought about the deep ways that perfume touches our most primal selves and the collective self of our species, I realized that I had the makings of an adventure story of sorts, an entr�e to writing about scent as a series of excursions into the fragrant world that I think will return you more awake and alive, more profoundly able to &#x201c;smell the roses.&#x201d;</p><p>To narrate it I chose five landmark scents&#x2014;think of them as five rock stars of the aromatic world. Each represents a key story line in the history of scent, intricately bound up in its adventures and intrigues and moments of discovery. Each also represents a class of material from which are derived the ingredients essential to the art of perfumery (and also to the art of cooking and flavoring). And each touches on&#x2014;and stirs&#x2014;one of the basic appetites that define us.</p><ul><li>CINNAMON, among the spices, attests to our appetite for adventure&#x2014;the pursuit of the exotic and the luxurious. It&#x2019;s a link to an era of risk and discovery, a time when not all was mapped and known.</li><li>MINT, among the herbs, speaks to the lure of home&#x2014;our hunger for the familiar, the authentic, the native. Mint is the quintessential American plant and a link to the &#x201c;weird old America&#x201d; of a bygone era that lives on in the national character, beneath the topsoil of modernity. But it is also indigenous to almost everywhere, a universal symbol of welcome.</li><li>FRANKINCENSE, one of the deeply aromatic resins traditionally used in incense, represents our inclination to the spiritual. The trees these resins come from are like a manifestation of the urge they embody&#x2014;to reach beyond, to transcend our temporal being by means of ritual and out-of-body experience.</li><li>AMBERGRIS, an animal essence, is testament to our unquenchable curiosity&#x2014;our fascination with the unusual, the strange, the wondrous, the &#x201c;other.&#x201d;</li><li>JASMINE, among the floral fragrances, stands for our yearning for beauty, for an aesthetic that embraces the evanescence of our existence as well as what endures&#x2014;an aesthetic embodied in the Japanese design philosophy of wabi-sabi.</li></ul><p>� � �</p><p>In A Natural History of the Senses, Diane Ackerman reminds us that our prehuman selves started in the ocean, relying on the nose to seek out food and identify enemies. &#x201c;In our early, fishier version of humankind . . . smell was the first of our senses,&#x201d; she writes, and cognition evolved from it: &#x201c;Our cerebral hemispheres were originally buds from the olfactory stalks. We think because we smelled.&#x201d; Scent has helped each of us, since we were babies, to recognize what is of us (famil...</p></p><h2>Mycroft Holmes</h2><p><b>A new novel written by NBA All-Star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar!<br><br></b>Fresh out of Cambridge University, the young Mycroft Holmes is already making a name for himself in government, working for the Secretary of State for War.

Debbie has written beautifully about her journey; the hills, shorelines, and bogs explored; the sheep and people she met along the way; weather both foul and fair, and a particularly exciting chapter about the intriguing St Kilda archipelago and its feral Soay and Boreray sheep. The eleven sock patterns, one at the end of each chapter, are a bonus and, for those of us unable to gather and spin our own fleece, all were test-knitted with commercial wool. The designs are knitted from top to toe with different motifs, among them color-patterns, cables, spirals, stripes, Kilt Hose with top-turnovers, and a pair of baby booties.</p><p>The author is an intrepid Scottish woman who, after earning a medical degree and raising her children, packed her rucksack with bare necessities, and set off to camp and walk throughout Scotland. I confess that I looked at the pictures first, and they enabled me to travel with the author, from my armchair. The photos of the seascapes are lovely, the author&#39;s cozy camping locations romantic (even the cold and rainy ones), and the steep cliffs and rock outcroppings plunging into the sea are dramatic and exciting. Of course, there are sheep everywhere, and a helpful map at the beginning of each chapter which allows you to follow the author&#39;s path. When I began to read the text, I was further enthralled. Debbie&#39;s prose eloquently captures the spirit of her adventure, during which she sought tufts of fleece on fences, on the ground, and caught in the bushes. She spun the wool (as she walked) and designed ten pairs of socks celebrating ten Scottish breeds of sheep, along with one pair that includes all ten varieties of wool. Instructions for each pair of socks are at the end of each chapter, test knitted in commercial wool. Through her story, Debbie ties together knitting and adventure, giving away her socks to people who helped her along her way. Debbie&#39;s writing is both a lyrical and a riveting story of her trek, augmented by plenty of photos of the landscape shared by both people and sheep. --Meg Swansen, author of Handknitting with Meg Swansen</p><h2>French Quarter</h2><p>Home to the notorious "Blue Book," which listed the names and addresses of every prostitute living in the city, New Orleans's infamous red-light district gained a reputation as one of the most raucous in the world. But the New Orleans underworld consisted of much more than the local bordellos. It was also well known as the early gambling capital of the United States, and sported one of the most violent records of street crime in the country. In The French Quarter, Herbert Asbury, author of The Gangs of New York, chronicles this rather immense underbelly of "The Big Easy." From the murderous exploits of Mary Jane "Bricktop" Jackson and Bridget Fury, two prostitutes who became famous after murdering a number of their associates, to the faux-revolutionary "filibusters" who, backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of public support&#x2014;though without official governmental approval&#x2014;undertook military missions to take over the bordering Spanish regions in Texas, the French Quarter had it all. Once again, Asbury takes the reader on an intriguing, photograph-filled journey through a unique version of the American underworld.</p><p>"For any true-crime collection." -- <i>Library Journal, July 2003</i></p><h2>Appetite for America: Fred Harvey and the Business of Civilizing the Wild West--One Meal at a Time</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER �&nbsp;Featured in the PBS documentary&nbsp;<i>The Harvey Girls: Opportunity Bound<br></i></b><br>The legendary life and entrepreneurial vision of Fred Harvey helped shape American culture and history for three generations&#x2014;from the 1880s all the way through World War II&#x2014;and still influence our lives today in surprising and fascinating ways. Now award-winning journalist Stephen Fried re-creates the life of this unlikely American hero, the founding father of the nation&#x2019;s service industry, whose remarkable family business civilized the West and introduced America to Americans.<br><br><i>Appetite for America</i> is the incredible real-life story of Fred Harvey&#x2014;told in depth for the first time ever&#x2014;as well as the story of this country&#x2019;s expansion into the Wild West of Bat Masterson and Billy the Kid, of the great days of the railroad, of a time when a deal could still be made with a handshake and the United States was still uniting. As a young immigrant, Fred Harvey worked his way up from dishwasher to household name: He was Ray Kroc before McDonald&#x2019;s, J. Willard Marriott before Marriott Hotels, Howard Schultz before Starbucks. His eating houses and hotels along the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe railroad (including historic lodges still in use at the Grand Canyon) were patronized by princes, presidents, and countless ordinary travelers looking for the best cup of coffee in the country. Harvey&#x2019;s staff of carefully screened single young women&#x2014;the celebrated Harvey Girls&#x2014;were the country&#x2019;s first female workforce and became genuine Americana, even inspiring an MGM musical starring Judy Garland.<br><br>With the verve and passion of Fred Harvey himself, Stephen Fried tells the story of how this visionary built his business from a single lunch counter into a family empire whose marketing and innovations we still encounter in myriad ways. Inspiring, instructive, and hugely entertaining, <i>Appetite for America</i> is historical biography that is as richly rewarding as a slice of fresh apple pie&#x2014;and every bit as satisfying.<br><br><b><i>*With two photo inserts featuring over 75 images, and an appendix with over fifty Fred Harvey recipes, most of them never-before-published.</i></b></p><p><strong>A Note from Stephen Fried on <em>Appetite for America</em></strong> <p></p> <p>I first encountered Fred Harvey seventeen years ago in the lobby of El Tovar, the historic hotel just a few steps from the edge of the Grand Canyon. His moody portrait was hanging there, his anxious eyes seemingly scrutinizing <i>everything</i>, and I wondered who the hell he was.</p> <p>A pamphlet in our room offered some insight, explaining that his company had been running the hotels, the restaurants, the gift shops at the canyon--even training the mules--since 1905. It also mentioned the amazing impact of his entrepreneurial vision. From the 1870s through the 1940s, Fred's revolutionary family business--which included restaurants, hotels, dining cars and stores from Chicago to Los Angeles along the Santa Fe railroad, and later along Rt. 66--had forever changed the way Americans ate, drank, cooked, traveled, and spent their leisure time.</p> <p>Hotel pamphlets don't often change my life, but I was immediately struck by what sounded like a great American saga that needed to be told in more depth, perhaps in a magazine article. So I started searching for information about Fred, picking up the few academic books that mentioned him, his company, and his legendary waitresses, the Harvey Girls.</p> <p>I learned that the Fred Harvey name had once been ubiquitous in America, as the company built the nation's first chain of restaurants, lunchrooms, hotels, bookstores--in fact, the first national chain of <i>anything</i>--and was heralded for its unusually high standards of customer service and employee loyalty. By the 1940s, Fred and the Harvey Girls were such a well-established part of Americana that they inspired both a best-selling novel and an Oscar-winning movie musical with Judy Garland. And they went on to inspire everything from the Howard Johnson's chain to McDonald's and Starbucks, and all the major national hotels (along with a robust community of Harvey memorabilia collectors.)</p> <p>As I continued my research, I found myself caught up in the little-known Harvey family drama. I realized that much of what was attributed to Fred himself had actually been done by his equally brilliant but unsung son, Ford--who memorialized his father by turning him into a brand-name. I am a sucker for stories about father-son family businesses, having grown up in one myself (furniture).</p> <p>Somehow I never got around to writing that article. But ten years later, I was having lunch with my editor at Bantam, and we started talking about the new breed of history books--like <em>Seabiscuit</em> and <em>Devil in the White City</em>--being written by contemporary journalists. I suddenly found myself regaling her with my fascination with Fred Harvey, insisting that the saga of his multigenerational family business had all the excitement, intrigue and narrative richness of this new genre of "history buffed" books. Writing it would also give me a window into an entire 75-year stretch of American history.</p> <p>By the end of the lunch, we agreed I write a book on Fred. It was the best decision I ever made in my career; this has been the most challenging and rewarding book I've ever written.</p> <p>The more I've learned about Fred, his family, his Harvey Girls, his business and his world, the more I understand about America. And, by reliving through them two Depressions and several major recessions, two world wars, two flu pandemics, the rise of trains, autos and planes, electric lights, telephones, radio and television, I am constantly reminded of this nation's courage and resiliency.</p> <p>The very first person (besides my editors) to read the manuscript of this book told me Fred's story made him feel better about America. And I know exactly what he means.</p> <p>May Fred be with you.</p><b>Stephen Fried</b> is an award-winning journalist and bestselling author, and an adjunct professor at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.

Willa has lately learned that an old classmate&#x2014;socialite Paxton Osgood&#x2014;has restored the house to its former glory, with plans to turn it into a top-flight inn. But when a skeleton is found buried beneath the property&#x2019;s lone peach tree, long-kept secrets come to light, accompanied by a spate of strange occurrences throughout the town.

She thought it was bad luck. My family is full of strange Southern superstitions. My great-aunt never liked for company to come in through one door and leave through another because she said that meant the preacher would visit. <p></p> How many of us grew up seeing our mothers throw a pinch of salt over their shoulders when salt was spilled? How many of us remember when our grandmothers whispered that a bird tapping on a window meant someone was going to die? We took these things on trembling faith as children, believing them to be real because <i>everything</i> was real back then. Everything had possibilities. So how do we explain, with our skeptical grown-up natures, why we still make an X in the air when a black cat passes. Why we still have to eat something in the morning before we will tell someone about our bad dreams. Why we still worry about umbrellas being opened indoors. <p></p> What is it about superstitions that stay with us, that encourage us to pass them on? Flights of fancy, maybe. Or nostalgia. Or maybe the power of the unknown is just that strong. We can&#x2019;t help but think: What if it&#x2019;s true? <i>What if it just might be true?</i> So we take an ounce of prevention instead of a pound of cure. We knock on wood and avoid ladders and never break mirrors.

It was to her that Our Lord taught two prayers invoking the Holy Wounds which the Catholic Church subsequently approved for recitation by the faithful. Although Sister Mary Martha&#x2019;s extraordinary gifts of grace were unknown, while alive, to the outside world, and even to most of the sisters within her community, this victim soul&#x2019;s life was immersed in the supernatural: continuous apparitions and messages from Jesus, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the Saints of Heaven; communications with the Holy Souls in Purgatory; the bearing of the stigmata; feeding only on the Holy Eucharist for years at a time; attacks from the devil; miraculous answers to prayer; infused knowledge of hidden and far-off events; and prophecies which arguably pertain to the unprecedented crisis we are witnessing in the Church today.<br><br>In obedience to the priests serving as spiritual directors to the Visitation of Chamb�ry, and in accordance with the express wishes of Our Lord Himself, the Mother Superiors of the illiterate Sister Mary Martha diligently wrote down the divine messages relayed to their daughter and the miraculous happenings surrounding her person. The details they compiled form the basis for this book and aim to fulfill the following words Jesus spoke to Sister Mary Martha: &#x201c;Your path is to make Me known and loved, especially in the future.&#x201d;</p><p></p><h2>The Two-Step: The Dance Towards Intimacy</h2><p>Ever since Adam wooed Eve (or was it the other way around?), couples have been bedeviled by the thorny path of love. Why do all couples have such a difficult time becoming-and remaining-close? Now, for everyone who has ever struggled with the pain of an unhappy relationship, psychotherapist Eileen McCann answers this age-old question in a book destined to become every lover&#39;s favorite bedside companion. McCann argues that the thorny path of love is nothing less than a highly choreographed dance that steps around issues of power, distance, and intimacy. With the help of Douglas Shannon&#39;s delightful and insightful drawings, McCann charts our unwitting steps in the dance of pursuit and avoidance and shows us how to transform it into one that returns joy and meaning to our lives. The Two-Step is a wise and witty guide to affairs of the heart that delights the eye as it instructs the mind. &#34;I find this book to be a pictorial treasure of how we act, showing the games we play, while trying to hide what we want. Out of these pictures comes a clear realization of what we are doing. With that realization, we can laugh at ourselves and be inspired to make the changes we need to make.&#34; - Virginia M.

CRY TO HEAVEN is my favorite Anne Rice novel, next to MEMNOCH THE DEVIL. Anne Rice has a real gift for transporting her readers to a different time and place.

We no longer live in a culturally Christian state. We do not live in a robust pagan state, such as Rome was during the Pax Romana. We live in a sickly sub-pagan state, or metastate, a monstrous thing, all-meddlesome, all-ambitious. The natural virtues are scorned. Temperance is for prigs, prudence for sticks in the mud who worry about people who don&#x2019;t yet exist. A man who fathers six children upon three women and now wants to turn himself into a woman&#x201d; attracted to other women he is praised for his courage. Justice means that a handful of narrowly educated and egotistical judges get to overturn human culture and biology, at their caprice.<br><br>We are not in partibus infidelibus. We are in partibus insanibus.<br><br>What shall we do now? The answer is both daunting and liberating. We do everything. That doesn&#x2019;t mean that I do everything, or that you do everything. Suppose you find yourself in a bombed out city. There are all kinds of things to do, and all of them have to be done. Some needs are more pressing than others, and some things can be done only after other things are in order. But everywhere you turn, there&#x2019;s work to do. You have to find clean water. You have to find food. You have to tend to the wounded and bury the dead. You have to erect shelters. You have to see which of the few buildings left standing are actually safe. You have to demolish those that are ruined beyond repair. You have to organize work teams. Someone has to prepare the meals. Someone has to keep the children out of trouble. In such a situation, it&#x2019;s almost absurd to ask whether it&#x2019;s more important to build a latrine than to gather together some undamaged books. All of it has to be done. So you do what you can do the work that is ready to your hand.<br><br>In no order, then, as I survey the ruins:<br><br>Build new schools, reform old schools, and abandon irreformable ones.<br>Are your children attending the sub-pagan schools? Get them the hell out of there. What are you waiting for? It&#x2019;s not as if the sub-pagan schools actually teach children English grammar and give them facility with numbers and make them familiar with the lands and rivers and seas of our world, let alone introduce them to the great works of western civilization. If your children are in the sub-pagan schools, it will require almost a miracle of God to keep them from becoming sub-pagan themselves. They too will learn to worship the three-poisoned god of our times, self, sex, State. Take for granted that everything in their classes will be sexuality and politics; even in science classes. Shakespeare? Sexuality and politics and nothing else. Get them out. Begin, if necessary, with one room and one teacher and ten children. Begin.<br><br>Restore your parish church and bring reverence back to the liturgy.<br>Was your church denuded during the Decade that Taste Forgot? Bring art back in. Is there an ugly sculpture of Jesus the Helicopter, or a pseudo-primitive stained glass window of the Baptist dropping a rock on Jesus&#x2019; head? Replace them. Are you using hymnals filled with bad poetry expressing hippy-dippy theology to treacly or unsingable tunes? Why? If you know a little about sacred music, learn more. It&#x2019;s never been easier to do that. Become more familiar with O Salutaris Hostia than with Table of Plenty. You don&#x2019;t have to be allergic to the great Christian hymns arranged by Bach or written by the Wesleys. Accustom yourself to real poetry, to melodies that can be sung by a congregation, and to thoughtful meditation upon Scripture. Learn Gregorian chant. Will it take a while? It will take longer if you complain about how long it takes. Begin.<br><br>Acquaint yourself with the proper use of the zipper.<br>No pretending here. We&#x2019;ve all been scorched by the sexual revolution. The ancient Christians knew they were living among hedonists, but plenty of the pagans, especially those who lived outside of the cities (Latin paganus = hayseed), were old-fashioned in their mores. The Christians could say that they honored the virtue of chastity, which the pagans recognized but often violated. We cannot say that now. We have to tell ourselves and our children the truth. There is no way to make it sound nice. We are Christians, they are not. How God judges them is not ours to know. Our first task is to follow God&#x2019;s law ourselves, before we can witness to them. We do not fornicate. We do not divorce. We do not engage in sodomy. We do not use porn. We do not flood women&#x2019;s bodies with synthetic and carcinogenic hormones. We do not care for obscenities in film. We do believe in marriage according to the evident design of God, imprinted upon our bodies male and female. We encourage boys to be boys and girls to be girls.&#x201d; And then where are the chaperoned dances? Where are the concerts? Where are the matchmakers? Where are the healthy customs whereby the older generation made sure that the younger generation would, ahem, get on with the great and innocent business of new life? Establish them. Begin.<br><br>Be social.<br>Be human. I&#x2019;ve heard all my life long that the Church, before Vatican II, had nothing at all for the laity. Really? What then were all those ecclesial fraternities and sororities? So laymen did not potter about the altar during Mass. They certainly pottered about everything else before and after Mass. They played basketball, they put on shows, they sang, they maintained the church grounds, they gathered for communal prayer, they fed the hungry, they taught the ignorant, they celebrated, they paraded down the main street. The official organs of public opinion hate us, and would like nothing better than to have us hang about empty churches like bats in a cave. Let them have more obvious opportunities for their hatred or their embarrassment, perhaps their conversion. Saint Ignatius had for a long time only two or three followers. He persisted, and the Jesuits became the greatest force for education and human culture and the propagation of the faith that the world had ever known. Begin.<br><br>Read good books.<br>Our Lord has granted us one of the most precious blessings in war. Our enemies are ignorant. They are clever they have brains, as all human beings do. But imagine a rickety fence against a cannon: that&#x2019;s our contemporary journalist against Chesterton. Imagine a squirt gun against a battering ram: that&#x2019;s our contemporary educator against Pope Benedict. Imagine a flea against an elephant: that&#x2019;s our contemporary advertiser against the Catechism. Imagine a dented bugle against a cordon of trumpeters: that&#x2019;s our contemporary artist against Dante. When Saint Paul said that he must be all things to all men, he did not mean that he would be stupid for the stupid. Put on the full panoply of God. Those arms may well include the weapons of natural law and natural wisdom that our sub-pagan neighbors have never mastered: Cicero, Aristotle, Plato, Confucius. Don&#x2019;t know where to begin? It hardly matters where. Begin.<br><br>Recover the human things.<br>You remember them? The things that human beings used to do. They are not to be underestimated. Let&#x2019;s not pretend here. We&#x2019;ve all lost a great deal of what once made up whatever sweetness that human life had to offer. People used to dress becomingly, play cards, talk to others, take long walks, sing songs, play ball, grow peas and beans, strum on the guitar, drop in on friends, and have friends to drop in on. Boys used to ask girls to do innocent things with them, like go bowling, or attend a concert, or dance. There&#x2019;s an idea learn how to dance again. The world, besides being quite mad, is now an unspeakably drab, tawdry, and lonely place. Build outposts of normality. It will take time. Begin.<br><br>Pray like the pilgrim you are.<br>That goes without saying. If you pray for ten minutes a day, pray for fifteen. But pray with a clearer aim. Remember that you are going somewhere. Its name, in one sense, is the grave. The whole world is in mad denial of that plain fact. It turns to the garish and obscene, lest it have to consider the quiet grassy mound and the stone with a few words on it. Be different. You are on the way. Take heart, and don the hat of the pilgrim. Do not be like those who have no hope. Jesus has gone before us to prepare a place. Will you have to repent of having sometimes gotten on the carousel of the world? Repent of it then. Begin.<br><br>Whatever you do, do it as if everything depends on just that.<br>It does, after all. Let no one say to you, What difference does it make if you sing beautiful hymns at Mass?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s the way the world thinks. For the world, despite all its pretense of love for every individual, considers men to be mere stuff, an accumulation or amalgamation. Do not believe it. The next person you greet may be on the verge of sainthood or damnation. Every moral choice we make repeats the drama of Eden. No one can do everything. Everyone can do something.

For more than thirty years, James W. Sire has grappled with this issue. In his widely used textbook <em>The Universe Next Door,</em> first published in 1976, Sire offered a succinct definition of a worldview and catalogued in summary fashion seven basic worldview alternatives. Students, critics, new literature and continued reflection have led him to reexamine and refine his definition of a worldview. This second edition companion volume to <em>The Universe Next Door</em> is the fruit of that effort, offering readers his most mature thought on the concept of a worldview, addressing such questions as <ul><li>What is the history of the concept itself?</li><li>What is the first question you should ask in formulating a worldview?</li><li>How are worldviews formed existentially as well as intellectually?</li><li>Is a worldview primarily an intellectual system, a way of life or a story?</li><li>What are the public and private dimensions of a worldview?</li><li>What role can worldview thinking play in assessing your own worldview and those of others, especially in light of the pluralism in today's world?</li></ul><em>Naming the Elephant</em> is an excellent resource for exploring more deeply how and why worldview thinking can aid you in navigating your pluralistic universe.</p><p>James W. Sire (PhD, University of Missouri), formerly a senior editor at InterVarsity Press, is the author of many books, including <em>The Universe Next Door, Why Should Anyone Believe Anything at All? Habits of the Mind</em> and <em>Apologetics Beyond Reason</em>.&#34;I highly recommend this book to others who seek to think in worldview terms.&#34; (Cheryl Doss, Mission Studies, 2008)</p><h2>Troubleshooter (Tim Rackley Novels)</h2><p><p>The series that started it all!</p><p>The maestro of pulse-pounding suspense delivers an explosive new white-knuckle thriller featuring deputy U.S. Marshal Tim Rackley -- a lawman driven by honor, morality, and a thirst for justice.

But thanks to a daring escape on an L.A. freeway, several deputy marshals are dead and Laurey is riding free. Rackley, back on the Service's warrant squad, is in hot pursuit of the outlaw and his ruthless gang -- with a media whirlwind and the entire Los Angeles law-enforcement community driving him.</p><p>Just when Laurey is within his grasp, circumstances force Rackley to let him go -- with devastating results. A few miles up the road, a sheriff's deputy is attacked: Tim's pregnant wife, Dray. Driven by guilt, Tim vows to hunt Laurey down -- a search that will lead him into a dark world of deception and lies, a world of criminals and undercover cops, drugs and mutilation. And the key to the violent puzzle lies in the discarded corpses of women -- women for whom Tim must seek justice when no one else will. With the stakes rising, Tim must unravel a horrifying secret and confront a deadly terror that reaches from the back alleys of Mexico to the poppy fields of Afghanistan ... and threatens to explode on the dark streets of L.A.</p></p><p><p>Gregg Hurwitz is the critically acclaimed author of <em>The Tower, Minutes to Burn, Do No Harm, The Kill Clause, The Program,</em> and <em>Troubleshooter</em>.

In his provocative work, Jeffrey Jensen Arnett has identified the period of emerging adulthood as distinct from both the adolescence that precedes it and the young adulthood that comes in its wake. Arnett's new paradigm has received a surge of scholarly attention due to his book that launched the field, <em>Emerging Adulthood</em>.<br><br>On the 10th Anniversary of the publication of his groundbreaking work, the second edition of <em>Emerging Adulthood</em> fully updates and expands Arnett's findings and includes brand new chapters on media use, social class issues, and the distinctive problems of this life stage. In spite of the challenges they face, Arnett explains that emerging adults are particularly skilled at maintaining contradictory emotions--they are confident while being wary, and optimistic in the face of large degrees of uncertainty. Merging stories from the lives of emerging adults themselves with decades of research, Arnett covers a wide range of topics, including love and sex, relationships with parents, experiences at college and work, and views of what it means to be an adult. He also refutes many of the negative stereotypes about emerging adults today, finding that they are not "lazy" but remarkably hard-working in most cases, and not "selfish" but rather concerned with making a contribution to improving the world. As the nature of American youth and the meaning of adulthood further evolve, <em>Emerging Adulthood </em>will continue to be essential reading for understanding the face of modern America.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jeffrey Jensen Arnett</strong> is a Research Professor in the Department of Psychology at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. During 2005 he was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. He originally proposed the theory of emerging adulthood to describe the lives of today's 18-29-year-olds, and he is the Founding President and Executive Director of the Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood. Among his many books is an advice book for parents of emerging adults,<em> Getting to 30 </em>(with Elizabeth Fishel).<br><br>"This timely second edition is a masterful contribution to the field of psychology and it presents a solid intellectual, academic, and research foundation for this insightful, new theory of lifespan development for young people aged 18 to 29. It brilliantly articulates the complex issues faced by this demographic between the time of adolescence and adulthood. Captivating and intellectually sound, this second edition is a must-have for anyone interested in the latest research findings in this ever-evolving field." -Michael S.

Katy couldn't find anything until she went up to the attic. And there she discovered a very special set of eggs... <br>Grandmom had painted them when <i>she</i> was a little girl. And <i>now,</i> she hung them from the branches of a tiny tree -- an Egg Tree! So began a very special Easter tradition. <br>This Caldecott Medal-winning story of a Pennsylvania Dutch Easter will surely inspire children to make Egg Trees of their very own.</p><p>When Katy discovers her grandmother's old hand-painted Easter eggs in the attic, she inspires the renewal of a special tradition: the Easter egg tree! This quaint Caldecott Medal-winning story, written half a century ago, will charm today's readers every bit as much as it did their parents and grandparents. Influenced by Pennsylvania Dutch folk art and tradition, Katherine Milhous creates a lovely tale that will leave readers of all ages impatient to break out paint, dye, and brushes to trim their own Easter egg tree. Muted hues of blue, brown, green, orange, and yellow are a welcome respite from the in-your-face vibrancy of contemporary illustrations, and create their own gentle radiance. Age-old designs such as the Bright and Morning Star, the Horn-blowing Rooster, the Cooing Dove, and the Pomegranate decorate the borders and eggs, providing a sense of deep-rooted history and tradition.

Many Catholics believe that far more people would attend if only the homilies were better, or the music were more inspiring, or . . . the list goes on. But best-selling authors Fr. Dominic Grassi and Joe Paprocki are convinced that the real problem lies not in the Mass itself but in a lack of understanding of how the Mass prepares each person to live day in and day out as a baptized Catholic Christian. <br>In <i>Living the Mass</i>, Grassi and Paprocki show how each part of the Mass relates to our baptismal call, closing the chasm between Sunday Mass and daily life. This newly revised edition takes into account the changes in the new <i>Roman Missal</i>, yet rather than isolating those texts or commenting on them, the authors have integrated the changes seamlessly into the book. This assimilation ensures that readers stay focused on the core message of the book&#x2014;how the Mass as a whole changes us&#x2014;rather than become sidetracked by the Missal&#x2019;s new texts.<br>Ideal for the countless Catholics who attend Mass simply out of habit, for the many who haven&#x2019;t been to Mass in a while, or for anyone seeking to join the Catholic Church, <i>Living the Mass</i> compellingly demonstrates how the one hour spent at Mass on Sunday can truly transform the other 167 hours of the week.</p></p><p><p>We are meant to live the Mass, not merely attend it, write Fr. Dominic Grassi and Joe Paprocki, a priest and a layman who fervently believe that the central worship event of the Catholic faith is meant to transform our world. They begin their book by quoting the words that the priest says at the end of every Mass &#x201c;Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.&#x201d; This outward-looking, service-oriented focus is the purpose of the Mass. It is intended to equip Catholics with the grace, knowledge, and energy to heal a broken world.</p><p>In their lively, readable explanation of the Mass, the authors are particularly alert to the way the Mass strengthens and renews the baptismal commitment of those who attend. Catholics are not strangersto each other but are a body of brothers and sisters, redeemed by Christ, and charged with carrying out his continuing work in the world. The Eucharist is food for a journey of service to family, community, and the world.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Living the Mass is a rich and resonant meditation on the Eucharist that will deepen the liturgy for those on both sides of the altar.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Andrew Greeley<br>&#x201c;We Catholics don&#x2019;t go to Mass; we go back to Mass&#x2014;from having been &#x2018;sent forth&#x2019; the last time! Grassi and Paprocki explain why, how, and where in this important new book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Gregory F. A. Pierce, author of Spirituality at Work</p><p>The concluding prayer of the Mass is a command: Go in peace to love and serve the Lord. We are charged to go forth and quite literally transform our families, our communities, and our world through the redeeming sacrifice of Christ as celebrated in the Mass. Fr. Dominic Grassi and Joe Paprocki use this challenge as the starting point for their inspiring and illuminating look at the central act of Catholic worship. They ask, What would our faith look like if we truly understood the gift of the Eucharist?</p><p><i>Living the Mass</i> will stir a new passion for and a greater understanding of this sacred two-thousand-year-old celebration offered freely to all who come, to all who believe.<br>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Living the Mass is a rich and resonant meditation on the Eucharist that will deepen the liturgy for those on both sides of the altar.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Andrew Greeley<br>&#x201c;We Catholics don&#x2019;t go to Mass; we go back to Mass&#x2014;from having been &#x2018;sent forth&#x2019; the last time!

When a trio of "academics" hijacked his persona for an infomorph&#x2014;basically an automated Twitter feed that spewed inane comments about food in his name&#x2014;he took the fight to the internet, where the virtual, virulent hordes soon compelled the spambot authors to cease and desist. The experience hatched a thought: Once upon a time, if you wanted to participate in a good, old-fashioned public humiliation, you actually had to show up. But as with most everything else, the internet has made condemnation an exercise in crowdsourcing, with today&#x2019;s angry mobs trading stockades and scarlet As for social media and its inherent anonymity. </p> <p><em>So You&#x2019;ve Been Publicly Shamed</em> is Ronson's tour through a not-necessarily-brave new world where faceless commenters wield the power to destroy lives and careers, where the punishments often outweigh the crimes, and where there is no self-control and (ironically) no consequences. On one hand, part of what makes this book (again, ironically) so fun to read is a certain <em>schadenfreude</em>; it&#x2019;s fun to read about others' misfortunes, especially if we think they "had it coming." Jonah Lehrer, whose admitted plagiarism and falsifications probably earned him his fall, stalks these pages. But so does Justine Sacco, whose ill-conceived tweet probably didn&#x2019;t merit hers; as it turns out, the internet doesn&#x2019;t always differentiate the misdemeanors from the felonies. But the best reason to read this is Ronson's style, which is funny and brisk, yet informative and never condescending. <em>So You&#x2019;ve Been Publicly Shamed</em> is not a scholarly book, nor is it a workbook about navigating ignominy. It's an entertaining investigation into a growing--and often disturbing--demimonde of uncharitable impulses run amok. <em>--Jon Foro</em></p>Jon Ronson&#x2019;s books include the New York Times bestsellers The Psychopath Test and Lost at Sea: The Jon Ronson Mysteries and the international bestsellers Them: Adventures with Extremists and The Men Who Stare at Goats. He cowrote the screenplay for the movie Frank, which starred Michael Fassbender and Maggie Gyllenhaal. A regular contributor to This American Life, Ronson lives in London and New York City.</p><h2>Symbolic Logic and the Game of Logic (Dover Recreational Math)</h2><p>In this unique fusion of logical thought and inimitable whimsy, Over 350 ingenious problems involve classical logic: logic is expressed in terms of symbols; syllogisms and the sorites are diagrammed; logic becomes a game played with 2 diagrams and a set of counters. Two books bound as one.</p><p>Yes, this is the Lewis Carroll who wrote Alice in Wonderland, and these two works show the same quirky humor. Here you see Carroll the mathematician at his playful best. Don&#39;t let the title of the first work mislead you--this isn&#39;t about modern symbolic logic but about ways of expressing classical logic with symbols. It&#39;s loaded with amusing problems to delight any mathematical puzzler. In the second work he turns logic into a game played with diagrams and colored counters, giving you hundreds of challenging and witty syllogisms to solve. Great mind-stretching fun.<p>Lewis Carroll (1832&#x2013;98) was the pseudonym of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University. <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> and its sequel,<i> Through the Looking Glass,</i> are rich repositories of his sparkling gifts for wordplay, logic, and fantasy.</p></p><h2>Psychiatry Under the Influence: Institutional Corruption, Social Injury, and Prescriptions for Reform</h2><p>Psychiatry Under the Influence investigates the actions and practices of the American Psychiatric Association and academic psychiatry in the United States, and presents it as a case study of institutional corruption.</p><p>Robert Whitaker is the author of four books, two of which&#x2015;Mad in America and Anatomy of an Epidemic - tell of the history of psychiatric treatments.

She received the 2014 Distinguished Publication Award from the Association for Women in Psychology for her paper "Industry's Colonization of Psychiatry."<p>"This timely book is a careful and thoughtful analysis of institutional and political influences on the way psychiatry works today, and it provides a scholarly exploration of a problem that has consequences for all of us. Whitaker and Cosgrove's passionate critique gives us the resources to develop solutions and to mobilize voices for an authentically liberating response to questions of mental health." - Ian Parker, Professor of Management, University of Leicester, UK</p>"Psychiatry Under the Influence is a thoughtful and well-researched expos� of the current framing of mental health and illness, using the lens of institutional corruption to examine the dual influence of psychiatry's financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry and professional protectionism. This is a profoundly humanistic critique of how the scientific evidence supporting newer psychiatric drug treatments could be so poor, yet have 'street cred'. This a 'must read' on the medicalization of modern life." - Barbara Mintzes, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sydney, Australia<p></p></p><h2>Structured Computer Organization</h2><p><i>Structured Computer Organization,</i> specifically written for undergraduate students, is a best-selling guide that provides an accessible introduction to computer hardware and architecture.

Earlier he had worked in experimental biophysics at Tulane University and the Veteran's Administration Hospital in New Orleans under the direction of Robert Dixon McAfee, where Dr. McAfee's research team's primary focus was on the active transport of sodium ions by biological membranes. Penney's primary contribution here was the development of a mathematical model (using simultaneous ordinary differential equations) for the metabolic phenomena regulating such transport, with potential future applications in kidney physiology, management of hypertension, and treatment of congestive heart failure. He also designed and constructed servomechanisms for the accurate monitoring of ion transport, a phenomenon involving the measurement of potentials in microvolts at impedances of millions of megohms. Penney began teaching calculus at Tulane in 1957 and taught that course almost every term with enthusiasm and distinction until his retirement at the end of the last millennium. During his tenure at the University of Georgia he received numerous University-wide teaching awards as well as directing several doctoral dissertations and seven undergraduate research projects.

Maurice Halbwachs (1877-1945) addressed this question for the first time in his work on collective memory, which established him as a major figure in the history of sociology. This volume, the first comprehensive English-language translation of Halbwach's writings on the social construction of memory, fills a major gap in the literature on the sociology of knowledge.</p> <p>Halbwachs' primary thesis is that human memory can only function within a collective context. Collective memory, Halbwachs asserts, is always selective; various groups of people have different collective memories, which in turn give rise to different modes of behavior. Halbwachs shows, for example, how pilgrims to the Holy Land over the centuries evoked very different images of the events of Jesus' life; how wealthy old families in France have a memory of the past that diverges sharply from that of the nouveaux riches; and how working class construction of reality differ from those of their middle-class counterparts.<br> <br> With a detailed introduction by Lewis A. Coser, this translation will be an indispensable source for new research in historical sociology and cultural memory.<br> <br> Lewis A. Coser is Distinguished Professor of Sociology Emeritus at the State University of New York and Adjunct Professor of Sociology at Boston College.</p></p><p><b>Lewis A.

The task of the sculptor is to understand the natural properties of a chosen material, to know in the process of creation how best to work with, or against, its characteristics. In this generously illustrated studio manual, sculptor Oliver Andrews takes a new approach to sculpture, focusing on how the innate assertiveness of materials affects the complex act of making a sculpture.</p><p>In this book I try to show how this assertiveness of materials interacts with the will of the artist in the complex process called &#39;making a sculpture.&#39;The late <b>Oliver Andrews</b> was a sculptor and Professor of Art at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><h2>Power without Persuasion: The Politics of Direct Presidential Action</h2><p><p>Since the early 1960s, scholarly thinking on the power of U.S. presidents has rested on these words: "Presidential power is the power to persuade." Power, in this formulation, is strictly about bargaining and convincing other political actors to do things the president cannot accomplish alone. <i>Power without Persuasion</i> argues otherwise. Focusing on presidents' ability to act unilaterally, William Howell provides the most theoretically substantial and far-reaching reevaluation of presidential power in many years. He argues that presidents regularly set public policies over vocal objections by Congress, interest groups, and the bureaucracy.</p><br><p> Throughout U.S. history, going back to the Louisiana Purchase and the Emancipation Proclamation, presidents have set landmark policies on their own. More recently, Roosevelt interned Japanese Americans during World War II, Kennedy established the Peace Corps, Johnson got affirmative action underway, Reagan greatly expanded the president's powers of regulatory review, and Clinton extended protections to millions of acres of public lands. Since September 11, Bush has created a new cabinet post and constructed a parallel judicial system to try suspected terrorists.</p><br><p> Howell not only presents numerous new empirical findings but goes well beyond the theoretical scope of previous studies. Drawing richly on game theory and the new institutionalism, he examines the political conditions under which presidents can change policy without congressional or judicial consent. Clearly written, <i>Power without Persuasion</i> asserts a compelling new formulation of presidential power, one whose implications will resound.</p></p><p><p>"This book is at once important and readable! Howell takes a long step beyond the modern literature that stresses the Presidency and legislation. He focuses instead upon initiatives a President can take with relative freedom from Congress and customary deference from courts; namely, executive orders: what? when? why? (also: why not?). Howell's model-building and discussions of his findings with its aid are themselves models of incisive analysis."<b>--Richard E. Neustadt, Harvard University, author of <i>Preparing to be President</i></b></p><p>"William Howell persuasively demonstrates that policymaking in the United States cannot be studied within a single institutional arena in isolation. In this innovative study, he draws on theories of executive-legislative and executive-judicial relations to build a model of presidential unilateral action and tests his claims on impressive original datasets. While few will agree with all of Howell's arguments, his book will likely set both an agenda and a standard for future studies of policymaking and the separation of powers."<b>--Nolan McCarty, Princeton University</b></p><p>"This is one of the best books on the presidency in recent years. The theory is clear and sensible, the data superb, and the case studies on-point and fascinating. It is also a pleasure to read."<b>--Charles Cameron, Columbia University, author of <i>Veto Bargaining</i></b></p><p>"<i>Power without Persuasion</i> will be an enormously influential book on the presidency and American political institutions. It promises to change scholars' thinking about presidential policymaking and, in doing so, become a catalyst for future work. The rigor of the analysis is high, and the writing and presentation are clear. The book will be widely assigned to students."<b>--Brandice Canes-Wrone, Northwestern University</b></p><b>William G.

Rudolf Steiner, however, spoke of Ahriman as an actual, living spiritual entity. This being, he said, works to embed human beings firmly into their physicality, thus encouraging dull, materialistic attitudes and a coarse, dry intellect. In these extraordinary lectures, Steiner assumes a rare prophetic mode. He talks about an actual incarnation of Ahriman on Earth and the potential consequences of this event. Just as Christ incarnated in a physical body, so would Ahriman incarnate in the Western world&#x2015;before &#x201c;a part&#x201d; of the third millennium has passed. <br><br> Steiner places this incarnation in the context of a &#x201c;cosmic triad&#x201d; that includes Ahriman, Lucifer, and Christ. Ahriman will incarnate as a counterpoint to the physical incarnation of Lucifer, which took place in the East during the third millennium B.C. The incarnation of Jesus Christ took place in Palestine as the point of balance between the two. <br><br> During the period when Steiner developed Anthroposophy&#x2015;a teaching career of more than twenty years that included over than six thousand lectures&#x2015;he spoke of Ahriman&#x2019;s incarnation only six times. For the first time, these six lectures (plus a supporting excerpt) are reproduced in their entirety in a single volume.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

He has taught navigation to yachtsmen and has served as a script adviser for television and films. His books have been translated into nearly two dozen languages.The incomparable Michael Jayston reads up a storm with this Napoleonic-era sea story, set in the Mediterranean just before the Battle of the Nile. Jayston's impeccable pronunciation, his variations in accents and characterization, and his timing and the varying tension in his voice make this a remarkable listening experience. Commodore Richard Bolitho is tasked with taking a tiny squadron on an intelligence mission: Where are the French? There are battles and captures and blood. One can smell the powder smoke, thanks to the compatible skills of Jayston and the author. Nor are the human dimensions slighted; the characters are alive! They move and plot and think.

Spanning three centuries, and weaving together the stories of Renaissance magician John Dee, philosopher Giordano Bruno, and present-day itinerant historian and writer Pierce Moffitt, the �gypt sequence is as richly significant as Lawrence Durrell&#x2019;s Alexandria Quartet or Anthony Powell&#x2019;s Dance to the Music of Time. Crowley, a master prose stylist, explores transformations physical, magical, alchemical, and personal in this epic, distinctly American novel where the past, present, and future reflect each other.</p><p>"It is a work of great erudition and deep humanity that is as beautifully composed as any novel in my experience."<br>&#x2014;<i>Washington Post Book World</i></p><p>"An unpredictable, free-flowing, sui generis novel."<br>&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p><b><i></i></b></p><p>"With <i>Endless Things</i> and the completion of the �gypt cycle, Crowley has constructed one of the finest, most welcoming tales contemporary fiction has to offer us."<br>&#x2014;<i>Book Forum</i></p><p>"Crowley&#x2019;s peculiar kind of fantasy: a conscious substitute for the magic in which you don&#x2019;t quite believe any more."<br>&#x2014;<i>London Review of Books</i>&nbsp;</p><p>"A beautiful palimpsest as complex, mysterious and unreliable as human memory."<br>&#x2014;<i>Seattle Times</i></p><p>"This year, while millions of Harry Potter fans celebrated and mourned the end of their favorite series, a much smaller but no less devoted group of readers marked another literary milestone: the publication of the last book in John Crowley&#x2019;s �gypt Cycle."<br>&#x2014;Matt Ruff</p><p>"Crowley&#x2019;s eloquent and captivating conclusion to his �gypt tetralogy finds scholar Pierce Moffet still searching for the mythical �gypt, an alternate reality of magic and marvels that have been encoded in our own world&#x2019;s myths, legends and superstitions. Pierce first intuited the realm&#x2019;s existence from the work of cult novelist Fellowes Kraft. Using Kraft&#x2019;s unfinished final novel as his Baedeker, Pierce travels to Europe, where he spies tantalizing traces of �gypt&#x2019;s mysteries in the Gnostic teachings of the Rosicrucians, the mysticism of John Dee, the progressive thoughts of heretical priest Giordano Bruno and the &#x201c;chemical wedding&#x201d; of two 17th-century monarchs in Prague. Like Pierce&#x2019;s travels, the final destination for this modern fantasy epic is almost incidental to its telling. With astonishing dexterity, Crowley (Lord Byron&#x2019;s Novel) parallels multiple story lines spread across centuries and unobtrusively deploys recurring symbols and motifs to convey a sense of organic wholeness. Even as Pierce&#x2019;s quest ends on a fulfilling personal note, this marvelous tale comes full circle to reinforce its timeless themes of transformation, re-creation and immortality."<br>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>Locus Award finalist</p><p><b>John Crowley</b> was born in the appropriately liminal town of Presque Isle, Maine.

He grew up in Vermont, northeastern Kentucky and (for the longest stretch) Indiana, where he went to high school and college. He moved to New York City after college to make movies.Reviewed by Bill Sheehan<p>John Crowley's Endless Things is the fourth and last installment in a vast, intricate series of novels collectively entitled "Aegypt." The series (which is really one long novel) began in 1987 with the publication of Aegypt (soon to be reissued as The Solitudes) and was followed by Love &amp; Sleep (1994) and Daemonomania (2000). It was clear from the start that Crowley was on to something special, and the appearance of this final volume confirms that impression. In its entirety, "Aegypt" stands as one of the most distinctive accomplishments of recent decades. It is a work of great erudition and deep humanity that is as beautifully composed as any novel in my experience.</p><p>Endless Things concludes the story of Pierce Moffitt, a teacher and historian who leaves his painfully disordered city life for the pastoral solitude of the Faraway Hills. There, surrounded by friends, lovers and assorted castoffs from the '60s, Pierce embarks on a new, though no less complicated, life and begins writing a book based on a radical new theory of history. This theory posits that, at infrequent intervals, the nature of the world changes in fundamental ways. As one age ends, the world moves through a kind of passage time, settling finally into a new age dominated by new and different laws, laws that unfold retroactively into the past. Thus, a world that is -- and always has been -- governed by physics might give way to a world that is -- and always has been -- governed by magic. There is, Crowley tells us, "more than one history of the world." </p><p>This view of history receives some unexpected support when Pierce encounters an unfinished manuscript by the late historical novelist Ffellowes Kraft. Kraft's novel describes an alternate 16th century on the brink of its own passage time. At the center of the tale are a pair of actual historical figures: John Dee, the Elizabethan scholar/alchemist who spent much of his life attempting to communicate with angels, and Giordano Bruno, the Dominican monk who first conceived the idea of an infinite universe and whose "heresies" led to his death at the stake in 1600. Dee, Bruno and Pierce have one thing in common: They are all seekers after Meaning, and their intertwined stories reflect and illuminate each other in countless large and small ways.</p><p>By the time Endless Things begins, many of the narrative's central events have already occurred in earlier volumes. Dee, deserted by his angels, has settled into an old age marked by poverty and neglect. Bruno, after reaching the zenith of his notoriety, has fallen into the hands of the Inquisition. And Pierce, laboring away on a book he can never finish, has barely survived a lacerating love affair and has played a crucial role in rescuing a very important young girl from a predatory religious cult. In some respects, Endless Things becomes an extended aftermath, a valedictory that encompasses the end of one age and the beginning of the next. In the process, it offers a fresh, sometimes revisionist perspective on all that has gone before, brings back a gallery of familiar characters and adds a few new ones to the mix.</p><p> Familiar faces from earlier volumes include Brent Spofford, Vietnam vet turned shepherd; Rosie Rasmussen, Pierce's friend and occasional employer; Sam, Rosie's epileptic daughter; and Axel Moffitt, Pierce's wonderfully eccentric father. Also making a final, enigmatic appearance is one of my favorite characters, Frank Walker Barr, professor of history and author of "Time's Body," a book that doesn't exist in the world outside the novel, but should. Of the new characters, the most significant is Roo Corvino, a feisty female car dealer who provides Pierce with a gateway to the larger world -- the larger life -- that has always eluded him.</p><p>The search for a larger, more expansive way of living stands at the heart of this complex collection of nested narratives. John Dee dedicates his life to the search for angelic presences and magical transformations, while Bruno chooses to burn rather than accept the tiny, imprisoning universe of religious and scientific orthodoxy. Prison cells, real and symbolic, appear throughout the novel. Bruno spends the years before his death in one such cell. Pierce, adrift and imprisoned in another age, makes a pilgrimage to that same cell. For these men, the theory of cyclical historical change that Pierce uncovers becomes, in the end, a source of solace and hope, for if the universe is capable of endless change, then so are we. </p><p>In Endless Things, Crowley finally allows his long-suffering characters to leave their respective prisons and enter the "limitless common day" that awaits them. Following their slow, uncertain progress through the course of four large volumes has been a deep -- and inexhaustible -- pleasure.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

French edition.</p><p>Along with Mickey Mouse and Asterix, Tintin is one of the world's most recognizable cartoon characters. If you haven't read any of his adventures, you are missing a real pleasure. The clean, crisp art style that defines modern European comics is almost entirely the influence of Herg�. Considered to be one of Herg�'s masterworks, <i>Tintin in Tibet</i> is a great book for both old and new fans of Tintin. It is compelling, exciting, and spiritually rewarding in the way that the best comics stories can be.Herge (Georges Remi) was born in Brussels in 1907. Over the course of 54 years he completed 23 albums of The Adventures of Tintin series, which is now considered to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comics series of all time. With translations published in over 80 languages, more than 230 million copies sold worldwide and a Hollywood movie to its name, Tintin dominates the Comics and Graphic Novels chart even today. Sadly, Herge died in 1983, leaving his 24th album, Tintin and Alph-Art, unfinished, but his hero continues to be one of the most iconic characters in both adult and children&#39;s fiction.</p><h2>The Story of Mankind (Liveright Classics)</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Remains a marvel: a sparkling, erudite, idiosyncratic tour through the human experience. . . . What a pageant this charming narrator continues to offer us!&#x201d;&#x2015;<em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong></p><p>Winner of the first John Newberry Medal, Hendrik Willem van Loon&#x2019;s <em>The Story of Mankind</em>, originally written for the author&#x2019;s grandchildren, has charmed generations with its warmth and wisdom. Beginning with the origins of human life and sweeping forward to illuminate all of history, van Loon&#x2019;s incomparable prose and illustrations presented a lively rendering of the people and events that have shaped world history. This new edition, updated by best-selling historian Robert Sullivan, continues van Loon&#x2019;s personable style and incorporates the most important developments of the early twenty-first century, including the war on terrorism, global warming, and the explosion of social media. The result remains extremely &#x201c;valid in broad outline if not detail and, as ever, a grand and thought-provoking read&#x201d; (<em>Kirkus Reviews</em>).</p> 177 illustrations</p><p>Anyone who can chronicle world history from 500,000 B.C. to present times--and do so in a lively, entertaining style--deserves a medal. Luckily, the bestowers of the very first Newbery Medal in 1922 thought so, too. The warm, personable tone of Hendrik Willem van Loon's writing lends itself to true learning in a way that stern, dry textbooks never do. In the introduction, he describes climbing a tower in Rotterdam in his youth. Years later, the perspective at the top inspired the author to develop a metaphor of history as a "mighty Tower of Experience, which Time has built amidst the endless fields of bygone ages."<p> This genuinely enjoyable charmer, for history buffs and the historically challenged alike, covers human history from prehistoric times, when our earliest ancestors were learning to communicate with grunts, right through to the issues of the latter 20th century: gay rights, Arab-Israeli conflicts, and health and fitness. Revised and updated several times since 1921, van Loon's inviting classic is filled with stories (and witty parenthetical asides) that bring history alive. His pen-and-ink illustrations, maps, and animated chronology contribute to the cozy, round the fireplace aspect of the book. (Ages 12 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>It was intended for children, and of course much of the science is hopelessly out of date, but this ambitious, even audacious attempt to offer an overview of the entirety of human history remains a breathtaking work today. A 1921 bestseller, The Story of Mankind won the first Newbery Medal in 1922, and it is no wonder: the book--which begins with the origin of life itself on our planet and the arrival of the earliest protohumans on the scene and ends with &#34;The Last Fifty Years, Including Several Explanations and an Apology&#34;--is abundant with an offbeat charm and packed with the author&#39;s own beautiful illustrations and maps that are alive with a fresh, delectable humor. As a document of early modern science writing, it is invaluable. As a delightfully entertaining read, it is not to be missed.</p><h2>A Theory of Personality: The Psychology of Personal Constructs (Norton Library (Paperback))</h2><p><p><strong>"A genuine new departure and a spirited contribution to the psychology of personality." &#x2015;Jerome S. Bruner</strong></p> This original theory of personality is based on the concept that there are many workable ways by which individuals can construct their world. George Kelly's starting point and basic premise is that people's processes are psychologically channeled by the ways they anticipate events rather than by the ways they react to them. We develop new means of overcoming obstacles; we are, therefore, neither prisoners of our environment nor victims of our past.<br><br> In Dr. Kelly's groundbreaking theory, the patterns of our make-up, which he calls constructs, are the key to changing old patters. Each person anticipates events differently, and Dr. Kelly shows how we can begin to understand each person's unique constructs. In this way, a person is enabled to create alternative constructions&#x2015;finding a sense of meaning in life, regaining control over his or her environment, and establishing new roads to mental health. This volume consists of the first three chapters of Kelly's two-volume work <em>The Psychology of Personal Constructs</em>.</p><p>This extraordinary and original work succeeds in raising to a proper stature and dignity the need man feels toward extending his cognitive control over environment, and what is more important, Dr. Kelly makes room for the unique individual and his alternative routes to mental health, long one of the chief dilemmas confronting science.George A. Kelly was professor of psychology at Ohio State University and served as president of the Clinical and Consulting Divisions of the American Psychological Association.</p><h2>The Railway Children: Illustrated by C.

This book is the first to compare theories of empire as they emerged in, and helped to define, the great colonial powers Spain, Britain, and France.<br><br>Anthony Pagden describes how the rulers of the three countries adopted the claim of the Roman Emperor Antoninus to be "Lord of all the World." Examining the arguments used to legitimate the seizure of aboriginal lands and subjugation of aboriginal peoples, he shows that each country came to develop identities&#x2015;and the political languages in which to express them&#x2015;that were sometimes radically different. Until the early eighteenth century, Spanish theories of empire stressed the importance of evangelization and military glory. These arguments were challenged by the French and British, however, who increasingly justified empire building by invoking the profit to be gained from trade and agriculture. By the late eighteenth century, the major thinkers in all three countries, and increasingly in the colonies themselves, came to think of their empires as disastrous experiments in human expansion, costly, over-extended, and based on demoralizing forms of brutality and servitude. Pagden concludes by looking at the ways in which this hostility to empire was transformed into a cosmopolitan ideal that sought to replace all world empires by federations of equal and independent states.</p><p>Anthony Pagden is university reader in modern intellectual history at Cambridge University and fellow of King&#39;s College.</p><h2>Studies in the sermon on the mount</h2><p>The Sermon on the Mount is not a code of ethics or of morals; it is a description of what Christians are meant to be. In Studies in the Sermon on the Mount, D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones offers a comprehensive exposition of one of the best known but often misunderstood passages in the Bible. With characteristic wisdom, he keeps one eye on Scripture and the other on the world as he explains Christs teaching to modern-day believers.</p><p></p><h2>The Last Leonardo: The Secret Lives of the World&#39;s Most Expensive Painting</h2><p><b>An epic quest exposes hidden truths about Leonardo da Vinci&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Salvator Mundi,</i>&nbsp;the recently discovered masterpiece that sold for $450 million&#x2014;and might not be the real thing.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>In 2017, Leonardo da Vinci&#x2019;s small oil painting the&nbsp;<i>Salvator Mundi&nbsp;</i>was sold at auction.

Many similar paintings of greatly varying quality had been executed by Leonardo&#x2019;s assistants in the&nbsp;early sixteenth century. But where was the original by the master himself? In November 2017, Christie&#x2019;s auction house announced they had it. But did they?<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Last Leonardo</i>&nbsp;tells a thrilling tale of a spellbinding icon invested with the power to make or break the reputations of scholars, billionaires, kings, and sheikhs. Ben Lewis takes us to Leonardo&#x2019;s studio in Renaissance Italy; to the court of Charles I and the English Civil War; to Amsterdam, Moscow, and New Orleans; to the galleries, salerooms, and restorer&#x2019;s workshop as the painting slowly, painstakingly emerged from obscurity. The vicissitudes of the highly secretive art market are charted across six centuries. It is a twisting tale of geniuses and oligarchs, double-crossings and disappearances, in which we&#x2019;re never quite certain what to believe.

He was flying first class, an unusual luxury for this comfortably successful but unostentatious Old Masters dealer, president of the invitation-�only Private Art Dealers Association. During moments of transatlantic turbulence he cast a glance down the aisle at one of the first-�class cabins&#x2019; closets, where he had been given permission to stow a slim but oversize case.<br><br>It contained a Renaissance painting, 26 inches high and 18 inches across, of a &#x201c;half-�figure,&#x201d; to use the old�fashioned art historical term, of Christ. The portrait composition showed the face, chest, and arms, with one hand raised in blessing and the other holding a transparent orb. One reason Simon was worried about the painting was that he had not been able to afford the insurance premium he had been quoted for it. He had bought it three years earlier for around $10,000&#x2014;�or so he had told the media&#x2014;�but it was now thought to be worth between $100 million and $200 million.<br><br>Far from being the life of luxury many people imagine, dealing in art can be a precarious existence even at the highest levels, because selling expensive paintings is, well, very expensive. Top-�end galleries have vertiginous overheads. Walls have to be repainted for each show, catalogues printed, wealthy collectors wined and dined. Simon had spent tens of thousands of dollars restoring the boxed painting, and had not yet seen a penny in return.<br><br>Solidly built, medium height, Jewish, fifty-�something, soft-�spoken, polite, Robert Simon is the kind of person who believes that modesty and understatement are rewarded by the higher forces that direct our lives. He projects a pleasant but slightly brittle calm. &#x201c;Loose lips sink ships,&#x201d; he likes to say, repurposing a slogan emblazoned on American propaganda posters in the Second World War to the business of art.<br><br>Simon leaned backward in his seat. He was overcome by that mood men fall into when they know the die has been cast, the pieces arranged on the board, and there is nothing more they can do except perform a sequence of now predetermined actions. There could be no more organizing, influencing, persuading. It was all done, to the best of his abilities. The confinement of the long pod of the aircraft cabin and the sensation of forward motion provided by the thrust of four jet engines combined into a physical metaphor for this moment in his life.<br><br>Alongside the submarine, the parachute, and the machine gun, the airplane was the most famous invention anticipated by the artist who had consumed Simon&#x2019;s life for the previous five years. Leonardo da Vinci was not the first human who had designed flying machines, and it is likely he never built one himself, but he had studied the subject for longer, written more, and drawn designs of greater sophistication than anyone before him. His ideas for human flight were based on years of watching and analyzing the airborne movements of birds, bats, and flying insects, and recording his observations in notes and drawings. His resulting insights exemplified his uncanny ability to deduce the science behind natural phenomena. As Simon felt air currents lifting up the plane, he recalled how Leonardo was the first to recognize that the movement of air was as important to a bird&#x2019;s flight as the movement of its wings.<br><br>On April 15, 1505, Leonardo completed the draft treatise On the Flight of Birds, also known as the Turin Codex. It was only about forty pages long, filled with unusually neat lines of text, written in black ink in his trademark mirrored handwriting, right to left, interspersed with geometric diagrams, and the margins sometimes decorated with tiny, beautiful sketches of birds in flight. Leonardo&#x2019;s early ornithopters, or &#x201c;birdcraft,&#x201d; had wings shaped like a bat&#x2019;s because, as he wrote, a bat&#x2019;s wing has &#x201c;a permeable membrane&#x201d; and could be more lightly constructed than &#x201c;the wings of feathered birds,&#x201d; which had to be &#x201c;more powerful in bone and tendon.&#x201d; Leonardo positioned his pilot horizontally in a frame underneath the two wings, where he was to use his arms and legs to push a system of rods and levers to make them flap. Historians say Leonardo soon came to realize that the human body was too heavy, and its muscles too weak, to provide enough power for flight, so his later designs had fixed wings and were more like gliders. He imagined launching one, appropriately, from a mountain &#x201c;named after a great bird,&#x201d; referring to Monte Ceceri, or &#x201c;Mount Swan,&#x201d; in Tuscany. Relishing the avian metaphors, Leonardo wrote that his &#x201c;great bird will take its first flight on the back of the great swan, filling the universe with amazement, filling all writings with its renown and bringing glory to the nest in which it was born.&#x201d; Nothing he designed ever flew. The contraptions were almost daft, but there was prophetic genius in his perception of the laws of nature that gave rise to his machines.<br><br>Robert Simon knew that, whatever the outcome of this trip&#x2014;�and that really could be everything or nothing&#x2014;�it marked the pinnacle of his career to date in the art world. If everything went well, he would probably earn a place in the art history books. If not, he would remain respected but unexceptional. This flight also represented the apogee of something more personal. In common with most art dealers, there was a motivation behind his career that had nothing to do with money or success, and that had shaped his life for somewhat longer: an unconditional, unrelenting love for art; not modern and contemporary art with its splodges, squiggles, and splats, but the great art of the past, especially the Renaissance, in which the eternal stories of the Bible and of ancient Greece and Rome were brought to life by the melodramatic gestures of bearded men and golden-�haired women, amidst thick gleaming crumples of silk and satin cloth, set against a classical backdrop of esplanades and porticos, temples and fortresses.<br><br>When he was fifteen, Simon went on a school trip to Italy. He still remembers the winding roads of the hills around Florence, the low sun flashing through the cypress trees as the bus drove toward the town of Vinci, the birthplace of Leonardo da Vinci, from Vinci. (By coincidence, my parents would take me on a similar trip in my own teenage years.) &#x201c;Leonardo has been my deity for most of my life&#x2014;�and I am not alone,&#x201d; Simon told me. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s my idea of the greatest person that civilization has produced.&#x201d; Over the decades Simon had seen every major Leonardo exhibition that had been staged, and every Leonardo painting, and &#x201c;as many drawings as I could.&#x201d; His professional life, which now revolved around Leonardo, had taken him once before into the artist&#x2019;s sphere, in 1993, when he was asked to examine the Leicester Codex, one of Leonardo&#x2019;s revered manuscripts, for its owners. It is now owned by Bill Gates, but then belonged to the oil magnate Armand Hammer&#x2019;s foundation.<br><br>Simon&#x2019;s family was well-�to-�do but had not been deeply involved in art. His father was a salesman of eyeglasses. Simon was sent to an exclusive, academically oriented high school, Horace Mann School, in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Afterward he specialized in medieval and Renaissance studies, and then art history, at Columbia University. He wrote his PhD on a newly discovered painting by the sixteenth-�century Italian Mannerist painter Agnolo Bronzino, which was held in a private collection. A portrait of the Florentine Medici ruler Cosimo I in gleaming armor, it was known from the many copies, around twenty-�five of them, which hung in museums and homes, or sat in storerooms around the world. Art historians had long considered that the original work was the one in the Uffizi, Florence&#x2019;s famous museum. However, in a story with uncanny parallels to that of the painting that he was now taking to London, the young Simon had argued that he had identified an earlier original of this painting, the owners of which wished to remain anonymous. He published an article about it in the esteemed journal of connoisseurship and painting, the Burlington Magazine. The painting now hangs in an Australian museum, as a Bronzino, although some experts still believe it was painted by the artist&#x2019;s assistants.</p><h2>Bhagavad Gita</h2><p>The Classical Dictionary encompassing the vast Hindu pantheon presents episodes, legends, literary works and geographical locales associated with Hindu religious beliefs.

In fact, the collapse of communism has created a vacuum quickly being filled by various alternative visions, ranging from ethnic nationalism to individualistic liberalism. But political ideologies are not merely a matter of governmental efficacy. Rather, political ideologies are intrinsically and inescapably <em>religious</em>--each carries certain assumptions about the nature of reality, individuals and society, as well as a particular vision for the common good. These fundamental beliefs transcend the political sphere, and the astute Christian observer should thus discern the subtle ways in which ideologies are rooted in idolatrous worldviews. In this comprehensive study, political scientist David Koyzis surveys the key political ideologies of our era, including liberalism, conservatism, nationalism, democracy and socialism. Each philosophy is given careful analysis and fair critique, unpacking the worldview issues inherent to each and pointing out essential strengths and weaknesses. Koyzis concludes by proposing alternative models that flow out of Christianity's historic engagement with the public square, retrieving approaches that hold promise for the complex political realities of the twenty-first century. Writing with broad, international perspective and keen analytical insight, Koyzis offers a sound guide for Christians working in the public square, culture watchers, political pundits and all students of modern political thought.</p><p>Koyzis (Ph.D., University of Notre Dame) is professor of political science at Redeemer University College in Ancaster, Ontario."Thankfully it is now common for Christians to believe that the gospel should shape our view not only of the goals but also of the nature of our politics, and that the theme of idolatry is key to understanding not only our personal but also our political life. But until David Koyzis's <em>Political Visions and Illusions</em>, this understanding has remained largely vague, tentative and intuitive. This book shows clearly and in detail how biblical insight into idolatry and ideology illuminate the most concrete dimensions of political life in a way rarely grasped by more secular political scientists." (Paul Marshall, Senior Fellow, Center for Religious Freedom, Washington, D.C.)<br><br>"David Koyzis not only helps us to see the basic worldviews that give shape to a variety of political perspectives, he also makes a solid case for a uniquely Christian perspective on these matters. This excellent book is a much-needed 'discerning' tool for understanding the basic issues of political life." (Richard J. Mouw, President and Professor of Christian Philosophy, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"David Koyzis has produced a truly original book illuminating the landscape of modern political ideologies. His approach is distinctively Christian, giving him a standpoint from which to cririque liberal as well as totalitarian ideologies. Moreover, the book is up to date with the post-Cold War world. This is the place to start for anyone who wants to understand the dynamics of ideological conflict in the world today." (James W. Skillen, President, Center for Public Justice)<br><br>"Political nostrums fly thick and fast in contemporary life--from print, radio, TV, pulpits and (perhaps most of all) casual conversation. David Koyzis's welcome effort uses wise biblical reasoning as well as the hard-won experience of Dutch Calvinists to winnow through the modern world's blizzard of competing politcal claims. Koyzis's analysis is both an effective survey of the world's contemporary political options and an encouraging Christian word on how to discern the critical differences. This book's combination of readable theory and wise Christian thinking is a first-order contribution to Christian political thought in its own right." (Mark A. Noll, McManis Professor of Christian Thought, Wheaton College)</p><h2>The Givenness of Things: Essays</h2><p><p><b>Long-listed</b><b> for the 2016 </b><b>PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay</b></p><p>The spirit of our times can appear to be one of joyless urgency.

She teaches at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop.</p><h2>They Divided the Sky: A Novel by Christa Wolf (Literary Translation)</h2><p><p>First published in 1963, in East Germany, <i>They Divided the Sky</i> tells the story of a young couple, living in the new, socialist, East Germany, whose relationship is tested to the extreme not only because of the political positions they gradually develop but, very concretely, by the Berlin Wall, which went up on August 13, 1961.</p><p>The story is set in 1960 and 1961, a moment of high political cold war tension between the East Bloc and the West, a time when many thousands of people were leaving the young German Democratic Republic (the GDR) every day in order to seek better lives in West Germany, or escape the political ideology of the new country that promoted the "farmer and peasant" state over a state run by intellectuals or capitalists. The construction of the Wall put an end to this hemorrhaging of human capital, but separated families, friends, and lovers, for thirty years.</p><p>The conflicts of the time permeate the relations between characters in the book at every level, and strongly affect the relationships that Rita, the protagonist, has not only with colleagues at work and at the teacher's college she attends, but also with her partner Manfred (an intellectual and academic) and his family. They also lead to an accident/attempted suicide that send her to hospital in a coma, and that provide the backdrop for the flashbacks that make up the narrative.</p><p>Wolf's first full-length novel, published when she was thirty-five years old, was both a great literary success and a political scandal. Accused of having a 'decadent' attitude with regard to the new socialist Germany and deliberately misrepresenting the workers who are the foundation of this new state, Wolf survived a wave of political and other attacks after its publication. She went on to create a screenplay from the novel and participate in making the film version. More importantly, she went on to become the best-known East German writer of her generation, a writer who established an international reputation and never stopped working toward improving the socialist reality of the GDR.</p></p><p>Luise von Flotow has published literary translations from German and French since the 1980s. Her interest in Christa Wolf and the re-translation of <i>Der geteilte Himmel</i> stems from her family background (origins in the northeast of Germany), extensive research and travel in East Germany (1986-1990), and the discovery and study of the existing translation (<i>Divided Heaven</i> 1965, Seven Seas Verlag, East Berlin.)"An ardent young socialist convinced of culture&#x2019;s mission to educate, Wolf wrote her first novel in 1963. Originally called &#x201c;Divided Heaven&#x201d;, it has now been reissued as &#x201c;They Divided the Sky&#x201d;. The difference goes deeper than the title. Luise von Flotow&#x2019;s faithful new rendering replaces a text that had been badly twisted by a zealous editor who was determined to suppress all straying from the party line.<br>...<br>The new version introduces in English for the first time the introspective, autobiographical voice that became Wolf&#x2019;s signature and strength. Its fragmented points of view and flashbacks were innovative. From the start her ambition was to honour the inner voice and &#x201c;bridge the contradiction between party diktat and personal truthfulness&#x201d;, in the words of her biographer, J�rg Magenau. This made her a revered, almost saintly figure to her East German readers; at the same time, her consistently uncertain, questioning tone put her on a collision course with the socialist leadership."

The authors take you through a graded series of problems, progressing from simple to complex pieces, teaching you all you need to know along the way.<br>Making a pierced brooch is the first problem. You learn to affix a tracing of the design to the metal, and to handle a center punch, saw frame and saw, needle file and flat-round file, and emery cloth. This first problem is fully illustrated, as are all the problems, with 53 different design ideas, as well as photographs of the tools and processes involved. Subsequent problems teach you to make brooches set with stones, chased and repouss� brooches, wire pendants, rings with four different types of settings, chains, and cuff links. Executing these pieces teaches you the processes of soldering, pickling, using a gas jet and blow pipe, making a plain and shouldered bezel, annealing, enameling, making a mold for casting, and much more.<br>Following the section on the making of jewelry, the authors turn to a discussion of the aesthetics of jewelry design. They suggest sources in nature and in art for creative ideas and motifs, and give helpful methods for developing these into designs suitable for various types of jewelry pieces.<br>The authors, both formerly of the Rhode Island School of Design, animate every line of the text with the knowledge that only long experience in the craft and in teaching the craft can give.

Father Sinistrari, examines a particular class of spirits known as the incubus and succubus. These minor demons crave sex and often attack their victims while they sleep. Though incubus and succubus are considered less dangerous than possessing demons, they can be relentless in pursuit of their desire and grow violent when resisted.</p><p>Demoniality advances novel theories about occult biology, claiming demons can reanimate corpses to have sex and impregnate victims with demonic seed to produce offspring who are "tall, hardy, bold and wicked." An expert on witchcraft and sexual sin, Rev. Father Sinistrari included sections on related phenomena, including: bestiality, necrophilia, demonic pacts, witchcraft, witches' marks, devil worship and magical beings such as fauns, centaurs and elves.</p><p>Father Sinistrari was a learned Franciscan Friar who used deductive reasoning to examine the characteristics of the spirit world. For example, do demons have mass? He concludes they do, but determines they are porous-allowing for their supernatural feats of passing through objects and appearing from nowhere. He also classified the demonic spirits by their actions, explaining that some seek out corrupt pacts with witches or wizards, while others are parasitic and indiscriminately attack the innocent.</p><p>As a primer on demonic behavior, Demonality is extremely detailed. Father Sinistrari was schooled in the sciences of the time, including herbalism, alchemy, elements, humors and the symptoms of witchcraft-even serving as an advisor to the notorious Inquisition. Because of this, he focuses on diagnoses and remedies to expel the pests, using his alchemical knowledge to devise herbal formulas for countering a demon's specific elemental nature. These elaborate herbal recipes are similar to the elixirs found in a magician's grimoire or a witch's book of shadows.</p><p>The title of the book is a play on the word bestiality, which conveys Father Sinistrari's belief that copulating with demons is, similarly, a sinful act and a crime. But while incubus and succubus are spirits doing evil deeds, Father Sinistrari is not dismissive of their salvation. He advances the theological argument that these minor demons have souls, and can be saved from damnation. He distinguishes them from the more vulgar type that tend to possess humans in terrifying displays. As proof, he shows how this latter class of demon greatly fears religious relics, while incubus and succubus do not object when in their presence: clear evidence, according to Sinistrari, that they are not damned, but are likely in limbo.</p><p>As a prominent exorcist of his time, Father Sinistrari encountered victims of demonic activity on a regular basis. Many of the afflicted were, ironically, nuns and priests in the service of God or people under their care. In one story, a young maiden of noble birth is romantically pursued by a spirit that, out of frustration with her chastity, finally attacks her. Another story involves a nun who disappeared to her cell where two voices are heard along with groaning and the creaking of her bed. A rival nun drilled a hole through the partition to see an attractive young man lying with her sister who mysteriously disappeared when the two were confronted.</p><p>References to demonic attack were carved into stone four thousand years ago long before Jesus Christ, the greatest exorcist of them all, walked the earth. As Christianity took hold, encounters with these entities were often laid out in moral terms. Father Sinistrari took a different approach: applying reason to understand this curious phenomenon along with theology, history and science. The result is this interesting treatise.</p></p><p></p><h2>Delicate Edible Birds: And Other Stories</h2><p><b>From Lauren Groff, author of the critically acclaimed and bestselling novel <i>Fates and Furies</i>, comes <i>Delicate Edible Birds</i>, one of the most striking short fiction debuts in years. Here are nine stories of astonishing insight and variety, each revealing a resonant drama within the life of a twentieth-century American woman.</b><br><br>In "Sir Fleeting," a Midwestern farm girl on her honeymoon in Argentina falls into lifelong lust for a French playboy. In "Blythe," an attorney who has become a stay-at-home mother takes a night class in poetry and meets another full-time mother, one whose charismatic brilliance changes everything. In "The Wife of the Dictator," that eponymous wife ("brought back . . . from [the dictator's] last visit to America") grows more desperately, menacingly isolated every day. In "Delicate Edible Birds," a group of war correspondents-a lone, high-spirited woman among them-falls sudden prey to a brutal farmer while fleeing Nazis in the French countryside. In "Lucky Chow Fun," Groff returns us to Templeton, the setting of her first book, for revelations about the darkness within even that idyllic small town.<br><br> In some of these stories, enormous changes happen in an instant. In others, transformations occur across a lifetime--or several lifetimes.<br><br> Throughout the collection, Groff displays particular and vivid preoccupations. Crime is a motif--sex crimes, a possible murder, crimes of the heart. Love troubles recur; they're in every story--love in alcoholism, in adultery, in a flood, even in the great flu epidemic of 1918. Some of the love has depths, which are understood too late; some of the love is shallow, and also understood too late. And mastery is a theme--Groff's women swim and baton twirl, become poets, or try and try again to achieve the inner strength to exercise personal freedom.<br><br> Overall, these stories announce a notable new literary master. Dazzlingly original and confident, <em>Delicate Edible Birds</em> further solidifies Groff's reputation as one of the foremost talents of her generation.</p><p><b>Lauren Groff</b> is the author of <i>The Monsters of Templeton, </i>shortlisted for the Orange Prize for New Writers; <i>Arcadia</i>, a <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book, winner of the Medici Book Club Prize, and finalist for the <i>L.A.

Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, helped you see the world as a more profound place, gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it.<br><br>For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago.<br><br>Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded, and the world seemed colder. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you, receive wisdom for your busy life today the way you once did when you were younger?<br><br>Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying, Morrie visited with Mitch in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final &#x201c;class&#x201d;: lessons in how to live.<br><br><i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i> is a magical chronicle of their time together, through which Mitch shares Morrie's lasting gift with the world.</p><p>This true story about the love between a spiritual mentor and his pupil has soared to the bestseller list for many reasons. For starters: it reminds us of the affection and gratitude that many of us still feel for the significant mentors of our past. It also plays out a fantasy many of us have entertained: what would it be like to look those people up again, tell them how much they meant to us, maybe even resume the mentorship? Plus, we meet Morrie Schwartz--a one of a kind professor, whom the author describes as looking like a cross between a biblical prophet and Christmas elf. And finally we are privy to intimate moments of Morrie's final days as he lies dying from a terminal illness. Even on his deathbed, this twinkling-eyed mensch manages to teach us all about living robustly and fully.

He shows us how, over the last half century, America&#x2019;s core values&#x2014;meritocracy, innovation, due process, free speech, and even democracy itself&#x2014;have somehow managed to power its decline into dysfunction. They have isolated our best and brightest, whose positions at the top have never been more secure or more remote. <br><br>The result has been an erosion of responsibility and accountability, an epidemic of shortsightedness, an increasingly hollow economic and political center, and millions of Americans gripped by apathy and hopelessness. By examining the people and forces behind the rise of big-money lobbying, legal and financial engineering, the demise of private-sector unions, and a hamstrung bureaucracy, Brill answers the question on everyone&#x2019;s mind: How did we end up this way? Finally, he introduces us to those working quietly and effectively to repair the damages. At once a diagnosis of our national ills, a history of their development, and a prescription for a brighter future, <i>Tailspin</i> is a work of riveting journalism&#x2014;and a welcome antidote to political despair.</p><p>STEVEN BRILL has written for <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>New York</i>, and <i>Fortune</i>. He founded and ran Court TV, <i>The American Lawyer</i> magazine, ten regional legal newspapers, and <i>Brill's Content</i> magazine. Brill was the author of <i>Time</i>'s March 4, 2013, special report "Bitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us," for which he won the 2014 National Magazine Award for Public Interest, and the 2015 bestseller <i>America's Bitter Pill</i>. He has regularly appeared as an expert analyst on NBC, CBS, and CNN. He teaches journalism at Yale, where he founded the Yale Journalism Initiative to enable talented young people to become journalists. In 2018, he cofounded NewsGuard, which rates the legitimacy of online news sites. He lives in New York City.<b>Chapter 1: The Protected and the Unprotected</b><br><br>Is the world's greatest democracy and economy broken? Not compared to the Civil War years, or to the early 1930s. And not if one considers the miracles happening every day in America's laboratories, on the campuses of its world-class colleges and universities, in offices and lofts full of developers creating software for robots or for medical diagnostics, in concert halls and on Broadway stages, or at joyous ceremonies swearing in proud new citizens. And certainly not if the opportunities available today to woman, non-whites, and other minorities are compared to what they faced as recently as a few decades ago.<br><br>Yet measures of public engagement, satisfaction, and confidence&#x2014;voter turnout, knowledge of public policy issues, faith that the next generation will have it better than the current one, and respect for basic institutions, especially the government&#x2014;are far below the levels of a half century ago, and in many cases have reached historic lows. So deep is the estrangement that 46.1 percent of American voters were so disgusted with the status quo that in 2016 they chose to put Donald Trump in the White House.<br><br>It is difficult to argue that the cynicism is misplaced. From the relatively small things&#x2014;that Americans are now navigating through an average of 657 water main breaks a day, for example&#x2014;to the core strengths that once propelled America, it is clear that the country has gone into a tailspin since the post-war era, when John F. Kennedy's New Frontier was about seizing the future, not trying to survive the present.<br><br>The celebrated American economic mobility engine is sputtering. A child's chance of earning more than his or her parents has dropped from 90 percent to 50 percent in the last fifty years. The American middle class, once the inspiration of the world, is no longer the world's richest.<br><br>Income inequality has snowballed. Adjusted for inflation, middle-class wages have been nearly frozen for the last four decades, and discretionary income has declined if escalating out-of-pocket health care costs and insurance premiums are counted. Yet earnings by the top one percent have tripled. The recovery from the crash of 2008&#x2014;which saw banks and bankers bailed out while millions lost their homes, savings, and jobs&#x2014;was reserved almost exclusively for the top one percent. Their incomes in the three years following the crash went up by nearly a third, while the bottom 99 percent saw an uptick of less than half of one percent. Only a democracy and an economy that has discarded its basic mission of holding the community together, or failed at it, would produce those results.<br><br>Most Americans with average incomes have been left largely to fend for themselves, often at jobs where automation, outsourcing, the near-vanishing of union protection, and the boss's obsession with squeezing out every penny of short-term profit have eroded any sense of security. Self-inflicted deaths&#x2014;from opioid and other drug abuse, alcoholism, and suicide&#x2014;are at record highs, so much so that the country's average life expectancy has been falling despite medical advances. Household debt by 2017 had grown higher than the peak reached in 2007 before the crash, with student and automobile loans having edged toward mortgages as the top claims on family paychecks.<br><br>The world's richest country continues to have the highest poverty rate among the thirty-five nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), except for Mexico. (It is tied in second to last place with Israel, Chile, and Turkey.) Nearly one in five of America's children live in households that their government classifies as "food-insecure," meaning they are without "access to enough food for an active, healthy life."<br><br>Beyond that, few of the basic services seem to work as they should. America's airports are an embarrassment, and a modern air traffic control system is twenty-five years behind schedule. The power grid, roads, and rails are crumbling, pushing the United States far down international rankings for infrastructure quality. Despite spending more on health care and K-12 education per capita than any other developed country, health care outcomes and student achievement also rank in the middle or worse internationally. The U.S. has the highest infant mortality rate and lowest life expectancy of its peer countries, and among the thirty-five OECD countries American children rank thirtieth in math proficiency and nineteenth in science.<br><br>American politicians talk about "American exceptionalism" so habitually that it should have its own key on their speechwriters' laptops. Is this the exceptionalism they have in mind?<br><br>The operative word to describe the performance of our lawmakers in Washington D.C., responsible for guiding what is supposed to be the world's greatest democracy, is pathetic. Congress has not passed a comprehensive budget since 1994. Like slacker schoolchildren unable to produce a book report on time, the country's elected leaders have fallen back instead on an endless string of last-minute deadline extensions and piecemeal appropriations. Legislation to deal with big, long-term challenges, like climate change, the mounting national debt, or job displacement, is a pipe dream. It is as if the great breakthroughs of the past, marked by bipartisan signing ceremonies in the White House&#x2014;the establishment of the Federal Trade Commission, Social Security, interstate highways, the Food and Drug Administration, Medicare, civil rights legislation, the EPA&#x2014;are part of some other country's history.<br><br>There are more than twenty registered lobbyists for every member of Congress. Most are deployed to block anything that would tax, regulate, or otherwise threaten a deep-pocketed client. Money has come to dominate everything so completely that those we send to Washington to represent us have been reduced to begging on the phone for campaign cash four or five hours a day and spending their evenings taking checks at fund-raisers organized by those swarming lobbyists. A gerrymandering process has rigged easy wins for most of them, as long as they fend off primary challengers in their own party&#x2014;which assures that they will gravitate toward the polarizing, special interest positions of their donors and their party's base, while racking up mounting deficits to pay for goods and services that cost more than budgeted, rarely work as promised, and are never delivered on time.</p><h2>Life in a Medieval City (Medieval Life)</h2><p><p>From acclaimed historians Frances and Joseph Gies comes the reissue of their classic book on day-to-day life in medieval cities, which was a source for George R.R. Martin&#x2019;s <em>Game of Thrones</em> series.</p><p>Evoking every aspect of city life in the Middle Ages, <em>Life in a Medieval City</em> depicts in detail what it was like to live in a prosperous city of Northwest Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The year is 1250 CE and the city is Troyes, capital of the county of Champagne and site of two of the cycle Champagne Fairs&#x2014;the &#x201c;Hot Fair&#x201d; in August and the &#x201c;Cold Fair&#x201d; in December. European civilization has emerged from the Dark Ages and is in the midst of a commercial revolution. Merchants and money men from all over Europe gather at Troyes to buy, sell, borrow, and lend, creating a bustling market center typical of the feudal era. As the Gieses take us through the day-to-day life of burghers, we learn the customs and habits of lords and serfs, how financial transactions were conducted, how medieval cities were governed, and what life was really like for a wide range of people.</p><p>For serious students of the medieval era and anyone wishing to learn more about this fascinating period, <em>Life in a Medieval City</em> remains a timeless work of popular medieval scholarship.</p></p><p><p>Medieval history comes alive in Frances and Joseph Gies&#x2019;s Life in a Medieval City, used as a research resource by George R.

A developed economy, focusing on textiles, farming, and financial services, could be found in the town center, where craftsmen competed for business while adhering to the guilds&#x2019; codes of conduct. There were schools for the children, though only boys could attend and the lessons were taught in Latin by a priest. The church was a hub of both religious and civic life; services were lively and filled with song, and baptisms and other special occasions brought neighbors together to celebrate. The weddings of wealthier townsfolk were lavish affairs full of song and dance and drinking that could sometimes last for weeks.</p><p>&#x201c;An excellently written account of what is known of the life of medieval burghers.&#x201d;&#x2014;Library Journal</p><p>Frances (1915&#x2013;2013) and Joseph (1916&#x2013;2006) Gies were the world&#x2019;s bestselling historians of medieval Europe.

He favored novel applications of paint in unusual matte finishes. For Kirchner, color was of primary importance, coupled with technique and style. He was one of the leading Expressionist painters of the time and was one of the founding members of the Br�cke. In his deeply personal depictions, he focused on the places where he lived and worked and his close friends and associates. This book, accompanying a major exhibition at the Neue Galerie New York, provides a visual survey of Kirchner's oeuvre and offers an in-depth analysis of different aspects of the artist's output. Essays by leading experts examine Kirchner's approach to color, his interest in the decorative arts, how electric light affected his treatment of color, the impact of Nietzsche on his work, and how he was profoundly changed by World War I.

Her dreams of an idyllic existence are rudely interrupted by the appearance of Ichigo, a tough-talking &#34;Yanki&#34; motorcycle-chick (on a tricked-out moped) who&#39;s part of a girls-only biker gang known as the Ponytails. Together, this unlikeliest of duos strikes out on a quest to find a legendary embroiderer, a journey that takes them to back-alley pachinko parlors, chic boutiques, and epic bike-punk battles. Novala Takemoto&#39;s hit novel [ital.] Kamikaze Girls [ital.], already a cult-classic in Japan and the inspiration for an internationally acclaimed film of the same name, is more than a quirky coming-of-age tale, it&#39;s a new way of life.</p><p>Born January 26, in Uji City, Kyoto.

His sequel to "Kamikaze Girls" was published in June of 2005.<br><b>Official website: http://www.novala.net/<br></b>This charming example of <i>shojo</i> (manga for adolescent girls) adapts a popular novel/movie and adds two original stories dealing with the same characters and/or set in the same commercial milieu. Momoko is ultra-sensitive and feminine, picturing herself as a pampered French princess while meticulously embroidering frilly clothes. Ichigo is a member of a girls' biker gang who hides softer emotions and dresses like a feisty boy. When the two young people are thrown together, each helps the other develop new skills for survival&#x2014;and for living as a whole woman. Artist Kanesada continues Takemoto's story by writing and drawing an additional episode in Ichigo's maturation, then concludes with a tale about a schoolgirl who falls in love with an older man in the garment industry. The book is more character-driven than much manga, and the page layouts do an unusually good job of weaving together different levels of the action, as readers can simultaneously see what the characters are doing, saying and thinking. There's something creepy about young girls calling themselves "Lolitas" and imagining that having sex with a grownup will transform them into grownups, too. Still, there's also a genuine sweetness about these stories as the characters grope uncertainly with new roles and take chances that can pay off wonderfully. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What unhealthy habits and attachments are holding your life together? Are you unconsciously dependent on food? Bad relationships? A job that doesn&#39;t fulfill you? Numb, constant perusal of your phone, looking for what? My qualification for writing this book is not that I am better than you, it&#39;s that I am worse. I am an addict, addicted to drugs, alcohol, sex, money, love and fame. The program in Recovery has given Russell Brand freedom from all addictions and it will do the same for you. This system offers nothing less than liberation from self-centredness, a new perspective, freedom from the illusion of suffering for anyone who is willing to take the necessary steps.</p><p>Russell Brand is a comedian and an addict. He&#39;s been addicted to drugs, sex, fame, money and power. Even now as a new father, fourteen and a half years into recovery he still writes about himself in the third person and that can&#39;t be healthy. This is his fourth book. He still performs as a comic and is studying for an MA in Religion in Global Politics. He has two cats, a dog, a wife, a baby, 10 chickens and 60 thousand bees in spite of being vegan curious. He is certain that the material world is an illusion but still keeps licking the walls of the hologram.Recovery is a beautifully written book with a message about the human condition that will strike a chord with many, if not all, of us. -- <b>Ruth Hughes, </b><b><i>Express</i></b> If you do not consider yourself to be an addict in the traditional sense, don't let that stop you from reading this book. Through the prism of his own experiences with addiction, eating disorders and abuse, Russell has captured essential, universal truths about modern society and the human condition. There is something here for everyone. He draws on wisdom throughout the ages and makes it relevant to the age of social media. Recovery manages to be both beautifully written and accessible. This is, in my opinion, Russell's finest written work to date -- <b>Natasha Devon MBE, mental health campaigner and author of <i>A Beginner's Guide to Being Mental</i></b> Recovery conveys the kind of pointed wisdom that usually comes from having woken up to our suffering, and is therefore real. Outspoken, outrageous and courageous all at once, reading it is likely to jolt you into seeing things in a new way. And you will find that this new way will include, in the most natural, unfeigned manner, a sincere wish to be of service to others. -- <b>Sharon Salzberg, author of <i>Real Love </i>and <i>Real Happiness</i></b> Yum Yum Yum. Russell is an example of how the path of recovery and the spiritual path can be one and the same, a path towards inner love and freedom from attachment. -- <b>Ram Dass</b> One of his most endearing qualities is his emotional honesty - his openness about his flaws and ignorance, and his confidence despite them. -- <b>CALM</b> Russell Brand is a gift to this world! His ability to translate how to transform your life using modern language and humor is an invaluable resource for a new generation. This book is a must read! -- <b>Tony Robbins </b><b><i>New York Times</i> #1 bestselling author, and #1 Life &amp; Business Strategist</b> Russell Brand brings an exhaustive and profound understanding of what it means to be felled by addiction and how to stand back up again. It is potentially there in all of us. -- <i><b>Men's Health</b></i> While the insights are not original, the experience of them is unique and it's Brand's own story that gives the book its energy. For anyone with an abiding interest in Russell Brand. -- <b>The <i>Observer</i></b> There is no better lesson to be learnt than by someone who has lived it. And with that in mind, Russell Brand is a man to listen to. Carefully. Beneath the performance he talks sense. A lot of it. -- <i><b>Stylist</b></i> Personally it always struck me as a bit unfair that only raging alcoholics and hopeless drug addicts got to practice the 12 steps, given how they provide such an invaluable emotional toolbox - now, thanks to the vision (his critics might say the ego) of Russell Brand, they are available to all. -- <b>Suzanne Harrington, <i>Irish Examiner</i></b> The premise of his programme is that the 12 steps followed by Alcoholics Anonymous can work for anyone. Recovery is the 12 steps, as translated by Russell Brand. -- <i><b>Sunday Times</b></i> A thought-provoking explication of the 12-step program -- <b><i>New York Times</i></b> Recovery should be read by the world -- <b>Ruby Wax</b> This is a brave and useful book, that I read in one day. It offers real insight into addiction and the stuff that drives it and Russell has done a great service in tackling the classic twelve steps in a non-reverential and totally entertaining kind of way that will help a lot of people. It feels wrong to say it is an addictive read, given the subject, but it really is. Russell doesn't just want to save our souls he wants to entertain us on the way. -- <b>Matt Haig, author of <i>How to Stop Time</i> and <i>Reasons to Stay Alive</i></b></p><h2>Life Together and Prayerbook of the Bible (Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, Vol. 5)</h2><p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, one of the most influential Christian martyrs in history, bequeathed to humanity a legacy of theological creativity and spirituality that continues to intrigue people from a variety of backgrounds.

Bonhoeffer completed the writing of Life Together in 1938. Prayerbook of the Bible is a classic of Christian spirituality.

Some consider it a form of predatory capitalism with adverse effects on the Global South. In this groundbreaking work, Aihwa Ong offers an alternative view of neoliberalism as an extraordinarily malleable technology of governing that is taken up in different ways by different regimes, be they authoritarian, democratic, or communist. Ong shows how East and Southeast Asian states are making exceptions to their usual practices of governing in order to position themselves to compete in the global economy. As she demonstrates, a variety of neoliberal strategies of governing are re-engineering political spaces and populations. Ong&#x2019;s ethnographic case studies illuminate experiments and developments such as China&#x2019;s creation of special market zones within its socialist economy; pro-capitalist Islam and women&#x2019;s rights in Malaysia; Singapore&#x2019;s repositioning as a hub of scientific expertise; and flexible labor and knowledge regimes that span the Pacific.<p></p><p>Ong traces how these and other neoliberal exceptions to business as usual are reconfiguring relationships between governing and the governed, power and knowledge, and sovereignty and territoriality. She argues that an interactive mode of citizenship is emerging, one that organizes people&#x2014;and distributes rights and benefits to them&#x2014;according to their marketable skills rather than according to their membership within nation-states. Those whose knowledge and skills are not assigned significant market value&#x2014;such as migrant women working as domestic maids in many Asian cities&#x2014;are denied citizenship. Nevertheless, Ong suggests that as the seam between sovereignty and citizenship is pried apart, a new space is emerging for NGOs to advocate for the human rights of those excluded by neoliberal measures of human worthiness.</p></p><p>&#34;This book by a leading scholar in development studies clearly documents the fact that governments and institutions have a more decisive role than markets in the successful experiences of development in the new global economy. It will become mandatory reading for students and policy makers around the world.&#34;--Manuel Castells, Wallis Annenberg Chair of Communication Technology and Society, University of Southern California<p>Aihwa Ong is Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley.

This monumental work encompasses 2,500 years of military history, from infantry combat in ancient Greece through the dissolution of the Roman Empire to the Thirty Years&#39; War.</p><p>Concentrating on land warfare, distinguished U.S. military historian Jones argues that most military events can be explained by military factors. The framework of his analysis is strategy, which Jones sees as remaining consistent for 2500 years. When applied, however, strategy becomes dependent on tactics and logistics. These in turn are constantly modified by technology. The result is an ever-changing dialectic of options that continues to make war a viable political option even in the nuclear age.

Through Franklin Roosevelt's W.P.A. and P.W.A., the Duff family becomes involved in the construction of the Fort Peck Dam, the largest earth-fill dam in the world. While most are happy for the work, there are others in the Duff clan that hope for the dam's failure. Mixing fact and fiction, Doig explores the hardships of labor, of Fort Peck's shantytown housing, and the Duffs' resilience to everything from Montana blizzards to rattlesnakes. When two in the clan are murdered, Scottish family loyalty is questioned and the remaining family members face their toughest challenge.Not since Steinbeck's <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> has there been a family saga as powerful as <i>Bucking the Sun</i> or a family as compellingly strife-torn as the one at its center. Driven by drought from their Montana farm to "relief work" building the Fort Peck Dam, the Duff family spans the extremes of the times, from the eldest son Owen, who has made his way through college to an engineer's job on the dam to young Bruce, his antithesis, a risk-taker who works as a diver setting pilings into the treacherous river bottom. In between are Neil, the quiet one, and the brothers' iron-willed wives. When a couple of wild cards are introduced, in the form of a Red Uncle from Scotland and the prostitute he takes up with, the plot gets as thick and turbulent as the muddy Missouri. <p> <i>Bucking the Sun</i> is a startling story of mixed fortunes that races from moment to moment, an epic rendering of time and place that reminds us why Ivan Doig is our foremost living storyteller of the American West.END</p></p><h2>50 Myths and Lies That Threaten America&#x2019;s Public Schools: The Real Crisis in Education</h2><p><p>Two of the most respected voices in education and a team of young education scholars identify 50 myths and lies that threaten America's public schools. With hard-hitting information and a touch of comic relief, Berliner, Glass, and their Associates separate fact from fiction in this comprehensive look at modern education reform. They explain how the mythical failure of public education has been created and perpetuated in large part by political and economic interests that stand to gain from its destruction. They also expose a rapidly expanding variety of organizations and media that intentionally misrepresent facts. Many of these organizations suggest that their goal is unbiased service in the public interest when, in fact, they represent narrow political and financial interests. Where appropriate, the authors name the promoters of these deceptions and point out how they are served by encouraging false beliefs. </p> <p>This provocative book features short essays on important topics to provide every elected representative, school administrator, school board member, teacher, parent, and concerned citizen with much food for thought, as well as reliable knowledge from authoritative sources.</p></p><p><p><br> "Anyone involved in making decisions about today&#x2019;s schools should read this book.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<br> <strong>Linda Darling-Hammond</strong><br> , Stanford University<br> </p><br><br><p><br> &#x201c;A timely and hard-hitting book.

It partakes of a broader reconstruction of the state wedding restrictive &#x201c;workfare&#x201d; and expansive &#x201c;prisonfare&#x201d; under a philosophy of moral behaviorism. This paternalist program of penalization of poverty aims to curb the urban disorders wrought by economic deregulation and to impose precarious employment on the postindustrial proletariat. It also erects a garish theater of civic morality on whose stage political elites can orchestrate the public vituperation of deviant figures&#x2014;the teenage &#x201c;welfare mother,&#x201d; the ghetto &#x201c;street thug,&#x201d; and the roaming &#x201c;sex predator&#x201d;&#x2014;and close the legitimacy deficit they suffer when they discard the established government mission of social and economic protection. By bringing developments in welfare and criminal justice into a single analytic framework attentive to both the instrumental and communicative moments of public policy, <i>Punishing the Poor</i> shows that the prison is not a mere technical implement for law enforcement but a core political institution. And it reveals that the capitalist revolution from above called neoliberalism entails not the advent of &#x201c;small government&#x201d; but the building of an overgrown and intrusive penal state deeply injurious to the ideals of democratic citizenship.<p></p><p>Visit the author&#x2019;s website.</p></p><p>"This powerful book shows that America's harsh penal policies are of a piece with our harsh social policies, and that both can be understood as a symbolic and material apparatus to control the marginal populations created by neoliberal globalization. A tour de force!"--Frances Fox Piven, co-author of Regulating the Poor <p>"Punishing the Poor is an incisive and unflinching indictment of neoliberal state restructuring and poverty (mis)management. It brilliantly exposes structural and symbolic consonances between `workfare' and `prisonfare,' and between emergent, transnational policy orthodoxies in social and penal policy. Lo�c Wacquant delivers a trenchant, radical, and entirely compelling analysis."--Jamie Peck, author of Workfare States </p><p>"This masterful treatment of contemporary punishment policies relocates the entire field within the political sweep of the twentieth-century ascendance of economic neoliberalism and the evisceration of the welfare state.

Instead, they spent the next fifteen months in a desperate struggle, living under almost continuous attack, forced into a slow and grinding withdrawal, and always outnumbered by Taliban fighters descending on them from all sides.<br><br>Month after month, rocket-propelled grenades, rockets, and machine-gun fire poured down on the isolated and exposed paratroopers as America's focus and military resources shifted to Iraq. Just weeks before the paratroopers were to go home, they faced their last--and toughest--fight. Near the village of Wanat in Nuristan province, an estimated three hundred enemy fighters surrounded about fifty of the Chosen Few and others defending a partially finished combat base. Nine died and more than two dozen were wounded that day in July 2008, making it arguably the bloodiest battle of the war in Afghanistan.<br><br>The Chosen Few would return home tempered by war.

With three hilarious books over the next two decades&#x2015;<i>American Fried; Alice, Let's Eat;</i> and<i> Third Helpings</i>&#x2015;he established himself as, in Craig Claiborne's phrase, "the Walt Whitman of American eats." Trillin's three comic masterpieces are now available in what Trillin calls <i>The Tummy Trilogy</i>.</p></p><p>Throughout the 1970s, as he wrote the "American Journal" feature for the <i>New Yorker</i>, Calvin Trillin crossed and recrossed the continent. Braver than most transients, he dined in every manner of restaurant, sampling all kinds of native cuisine. He tirelessly sniffed out plain but great joints where the local people loved to eat. "[Don't take me to the] place you took your parents on their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, [but] the place you went the night you came home after fourteen months in Korea." As a result of such hard-nosed pursuit of good food, this "Walt Whitman of American eats" produced three delightful books chronicling his gastronomic journey, and they have now been collected into <i>The Tummy Trilogy</i>. Trillin is a marvelous writer, affable and witty under any circumstances. He's also an extremely enthusiastic eater, so the books are filled with gourmet brio. Here's a sample from the first book, <i>American Fried</i>:<p> </p><blockquote> ME: Anybody who served a milkshake like this in Kansas City would be put in jail.<p> ALICE: You promised not to indulge in any of that hometown nostalgia while I'm eating. You know it gives me indigestion.</p><p> ME: What nostalgia? Facts are facts. The kind of milkshake that I personally consumed six hundred gallons of at the Country Club Daily is an historical fact in three flavors. Your indigestion is not from listening to my fair-minded remarks on the food of a particular American city. It's from drinking that gray skim milk this bandit is trying to pass off as a milkshake. </p></blockquote> <p> This book is almost as fun as tucking into a big, delicious meal (but no substitute, of course). Trillin's family, long-suffering in the face of a father's obsessions, is as winning as always. If you're a dedicated fan--or just dipping into the writing of this good-natured maestro--<i>The Tummy Trilogy</i> is a wonderful book. <i>--Michael Gerber</i></p>In the 1970s, Calvin Trillin informed us that the most glorious food in an American city was not to be found at the pretentious rooftop restaurant he called La Maison de la Casa House, Continental Cuisine. With three hilarious books, he established himself as &#34;our funniest food writer&#34; and, in Craig Claiborne&#39;s phrase, &#34;the Walt Whitman of American eats&#34;. Now the three books have been combined in what Trillin calls The Tummy Trilogy.</p><h2>The Paris Review Interviews, IV (The Paris Review Interviews, 4)</h2><p><p><b>For more than fifty years, <i>The Paris Review </i>has brought us revelatory and revealing interviews with the literary lights of our age. </b></p><p>This critically acclaimed series continues with another eclectic lineup, including Philip Roth, Ezra Pound, Haruki Murakami, Marilynne Robinson, Stephen Sondheim, E.

It provides the scientific reason for the polar reversals and ice ages. It also answers the age-old religious question: What is God&#39;s Day of Judgment and when will it happen? Douglas Vogt offers 60 major scientific discoveries or reinterpretations and 60 major Biblical discoveries. The thrust of Mr. Vogt&#39;s book is to fully explain the cause of the polar reversal and resulting ice age. At the time of the polar reversal, our Sun novas and that is what eventually causes the ice age. The model used to explain the mysteries of the ice age is his Theory of Multidimensional Reality, the first information theory of existence. The author proves that there is a very high probability the next polar reversal will happen between September and December 2046. He found the exact date encoded in the Torah. In addition, he discovered the exact number of years between polar reversals, which is 12,068 years. The Torah has this same number encoded in its text. The author explains how the Ark, the Tabernacle and the Rod of God worked and shows pictures of many of the altars he discovered during his two expeditions to the Sinai, Egypt. The publication of this book marks the first time anyone has scientifically proven the existence of God and His relationship to the Universe. For any theory of existence to be correct, it must be able to answer the three most difficult questions in the Universe: Why was the Universe created? If God created the Universe than who created God? And what is man&#39;s purpose in the Universe? The answers to these and other difficult questions are in this book.</p><p></p><h2>Mrs. Jeffries and the Missing Alibi</h2><p>Housekeeper Mrs. Jeffries must use all her extraordinary sleuthing skills when she is forced to take over an investigation when her employer, Scotland Yard Inspector Witherspoon, becomes a prime suspect in the murder of Peter Hornsley.

At her father's urging, young Princess Violetta tries to keep up with the same lessons, "even though she was so small she could hardly lift a sword at all!" Despite her brothers' teasing and laughing, Violetta continues to practice--even secretly at night. Soon enough, Violetta becomes "so nimble and quick" that when practicing with her brothers, "their spears and swords just hit the empty air." But then King Wilfred does the unthinkable: For his Violetta's sixteenth birthday, he plans a jousting tournament designed to bring "the bravest knights in the land flocking to the castle" to win...her hand in marriage!

Winner of the 1999 James Beard Award for Magazine Writing, he lives in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.Ruhlman (The Soul of a Chef) provides an insightful look at the life and work of legendary master boatbuilders Nat Benjamin and Ross Gannon, whose boatyard on Martha's Vineyard is the site of the most innovative work happening today. Ruhlman tells the men's stories through the boats that they construct, so a long chapter on building the 65-foot-long schooner Rebecca for a newly boat-struck buyer turns into an exploration of the unique connection between the rich people who buy boats and the working-class people who make them, as well as the slow and detailed work that goes into building a boat by hand. Ruhlman's discovery of the "extraordinary integrity" of Benjamin and Gannon's work, as well as "a parallel integrity in these boatwrights' lives," becomes "urgently important" to him "because this work and this kind of person [are] vanishing from our midst." Ruhlman is "not afraid to claim that the wooden boat is both ancient and great, that it connects us to the life that has gone before and that it's fully worthy of a life engaged in its construction." His ability to simply tell the boatbuilders story, making connections between boats and life, gives this sharply observed book its pleasures. (May)Forecast: Ruhlman, who has written extensively for the New York Times, should garner some attention, especially given the acclaim of his previous book and his author tour. The book's attention to manual labor, craft and the lives of men should interest readers of the more intelligent men's magazines.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Italian Futurism, 1909-1944: Reconstructing the Universe (Guggenheim Museum, New York: Exhibition Catalogues)</h2><p>352 pages with 328 illustrations Softcover, 8.5 � 11.5 inches Published to accompany the 2014 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM exhibition Italian Futurism, 1909-1944: Reconstructing the Universe, this volume endeavors to convey the spirit of the movement in all its complexity and features essays by nearly thirty authors, honing in on specific artists, series, and moments.

In the shuffle of so many responsibilities, it&#39;s easy to lose focus on pursuing godliness in every task. That&#39;s why a woman must train herself to reflect on everything she encounters and determine whether or not it encourages holiness. Her character, relationships, ministry, even her soul--all need to be examined and ultimately surrendered to God before she can develop the godly character she so desperately wants. Through poignant stories and faithful reminders, Barbara Hughes encourages women to discipline every area so that God is most glorified and they are most unified with Him.</p><p><p><strong>Barbara Hughes</strong> has supported her husband Kent&#x2019;s pastoral ministry for over 40 years while also raising four children. She is the author of <em>Disciplines of a Godly Woman</em> and is a popular teacher of women&#x2019;s groups. Together with Kent, she has also authored <em>Disciplines of a Godly Family</em> (formerly known as <em>Common-Sense Parenting</em>) and <em>Liberating Ministry from the Success Syndrome</em>. Barbara and Kent live on the West Coast, have an ever-increasing number of grandchildren, and are still actively involved in ministry.</p><p>&#x201c;Barbara Hughes shares both God&#x2019;s Word and the joy of living it. In her own warm voice, she invites women to believe and to adorn the gospel of Jesus Christ. It&#x2019;s an invitation not to a list of abstract disciplines, but to the grace of God that trains us in all the layers of real life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Kathleen Nielson</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;author; speaker; senior adviser, The Gospel Coalition&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This book is a treasure chest of Biblical wisdom. As Barbara urges us to fight the flab in our Christian lives, she generously shares the ways in which God has chiseled away at her life to make her the disciplined woman of faith that she is today. Her writing is thought provoking, stimulating, moving, encouraging, and deeply challenging. Every Christian woman who longs to be more like Jesus should read this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Lindsay Benn</strong><strong>,</strong> wife to the former bishop of Lewes, The Church of England</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Disciplines of a Godly Woman</em> is not a legalistic ten-step plan or checklist. Rather it is Titus 2:3&#x2013;5 in action, as Barbara Hughes becomes our sister, mother and grandmother in the Lord, challenging us to trust and honor God in the whole of life. After a lifetime in pastoral ministry and family life, Barbara knows the challenges we face as sinners living in a world crowded with ideas and pressures. She also knows that God&#x2019;s Word provides the wisdom we need and the cross of Christ provides the grace we need. At a time when many younger women are seeking mentors, and many older women feel ill-equipped for the task, this book is a wise and loving answer to both.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Claire Smith</strong><strong>,</strong> Bible teacher; author, <em>God&#x2019;s Good Design: What the Bible Really Says about Men and Women</em></p><p>&#x201c;As Christian women we long to have our lives give glory to God.

I highly recommend it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Margaret Grudem</strong><strong>, </strong>Scottsdale, Arizona</p><p> &#x201c;The word &#x2018;discipline&#x2019; often carries with it notions of rigidity and structure. Thankfully, Barbara Hughes is not here to give a heavy-handed list of rules and regulations for the woman who simply cannot find time to do any more than she already does. In this helpful, classic book Barbara walks us through the right kind of discipline, one that serves eternal purposes. She shows us that the way towards godliness is not through our own efforts, but the efforts of Another&#x2014;our Christ.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Courtney Reissig</strong><strong>,</strong> author, <em>Glory in the Ordinary</em> and <em>The Accidental Feminist</em></p><p>&#x201c;This book captures Barbara Hughes&#x2019; deep Biblical insight and practical wisdom. Whether read on your own or in a group, <em>Disciplines of a Godly Woman</em> is helpful for women of any age or circumstance. It is a reminder that life change doesn&#x2019;t happen by accident or overnight, and that godly living is not a mystery.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Ainsley Poulos</strong><strong>,</strong> Chair, EQUIP ministry wives</p><p>&#x201c;Through <em>Disciplines of a Godly Woman</em>, Barbara Hughes has been a cherished mentor to me. She has taught me what it means to be a gospel-centered woman, and the Holy Spirit used the book to ignite in me a greater desire to know God through his Word. Not a &#x2018;white-knuckle&#x2019; do-better book on spiritual disciplines, it addresses the heart and gives deeply thoughtful advice on how a woman can center her life on Christ. This book is my first choice to read with other women, and we recommend it regularly at our church. Read this book; let it change your life; and, then, share it with others.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Keri Folmar</strong><strong>,</strong> pastor&#x2019;s wife, the United Christian Church of Dubai; mother of three; author, <em>Joy!&nbsp;A Bible Study on Philippians for Women</em></p><p>&#x201c;As I look back on my own life as a woman and mother, I am aware of how much I would have benefited from this book. This book is helpful in liberating women from cultural misconceptions about the role of discipline and submission in the Christian life.

He served in the Marine Corps during the Korean War, was the London bureau chief of the New York Herald-Tribune, and was a writer for The New Yorker.Conmen, crazies, and the super-credu lous rush madly about in Portis's newest novel, which concerns the es tablishment of the order of Gnomons, a secret society purporting to teach the hidden knowledge of Atlantis. The ac tion begins in 1917, when soldier Lamar is relieved of $200 by a fast-talking stranger in exchange for the key to Gnomonism. The plot spins dizzily along as sly Sydney Hen and antic Aus tin Popper are drawn into the society, engineer a farcical schism, and espouse assorted crackpot causes. In perhaps the book's funniest episode, Popper teams up with a Roumanian alchemist to refine gold from the leaves of the noxious bag plant. Those who enjoy deadpan comedy should get a good laugh here, but others may find it hard to care about what happens to Portis' madcap misfits. Suggested for large fic tion collections.

With this book, Benjamin Quarles added a new dimension to the military history of the Revolution and addressed for the first time the diplomatic repercussions created by the British evacuation of African Americans at the close of the war. The compelling narrative brings the Revolution to life by portraying how those tumultuous years were experienced by Americans at all levels of society.</p><h2>Photographing Montana, 1894-1928: The Life and Work of Evelyn Cameron</h2><p>Photographing Montana showcases more than 150 of Evelyn Cameron&#39;s photographs, including vast landscapes, range horses, cattle roundups, farmers&#39; fields, and the wildlife of the high plains.

Her beloved characters--Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddle-Duck, and their whimsical friends--were inspired by the English countryside, which she grew to love during summer vacations as a girl. In 1905, at the age of 40, Potter bought Hill Top Farm overlooking Esthwaite Water in the Lake District, a region of hills and lakes famous for its glorious landscapes. She continued to buy property in the area with her royalties, and by the time she died 37 years later, she had amassed over 4,000 acres. She fought vigorously to preserve the beauty of the Lake District and its rural ways, leaving her estate to the National Trust, Britain's leading conservation agency. This book, written by an official of the Trust, is a tribute to the jewel of the estate, 17th-century Hill Top Farm. Potter restored and furnished it as a showcase of English country ways, though she actually lived in a large cottage nearby. Her substantial collection of Lake District antiques reflected the influential Arts &amp; Crafts movement, which emphasized the integrity of handmade objects in a period of increasing mechanization. The book takes us on a tour of the farm, alternating the artist's original photographs and watercolors with photographs of the building and countryside as they look today. Several two-page spreads of the garden in early summer and the Lake District in late autumn are especially beautiful. Unpretentious, solid, charming, understated: <i>At Home with Beatrix Potter</i> embodies the rustic virtues that Beatrix loved. <i>--John Stevenson</i>Susan Denyer, who has lived in England's Lake District for many years, works for Britain's National Trust. Her publications include <i>Beatrix Potter and Her Farms, Lake District Landscapes</i>, and <i>A Century in the Lake District</i>.</p><h2>All My Tomorrows (The Orphan Trains Trilogy #2)</h2><p><b>The second book in the Orphan Trains Trilogy from writing duo Al and Joanna Lacy</b><br><br>When 62 orphans and abandoned children leave New York City on a train headed out West, they have no idea what to expect. Will they get separated from their friends or siblings? Will their new families love them? Will a family even pick them at all? But their futures are wilder than any of them could imagine, and range from kidnappings and whippings to stowing away on wagon trains, from starting orphanages of their own to serving as missionaries to the Apaches. No matter what, their paths are being watched by someone who cares about--and carefully plans--all of their tomorrows.</p><p>Bestselling author <b>Al Lacy</b> has written more than ninety historical and western novels, including those in the Angel of Mercy, Battles of Destiny, and Journeys of the Stranger series. <b>JoAnna Lacy</b> is his wife and longtime collaborator, as well as the coauthor of the Hannah of Fort Bridger, Shadow of Liberty, and Mail Order Bride series.

Now <i>License to Pawn</i> takes readers behind the scenes of the hit History show Pawn Stars and shares the fascinating life story of its star, Rick Harrison, and the equally intriguing story behind the shop, the customers, and the items for sale.<br><br>Rick hasn't had it easy. He was a math whiz at an early age, but developed a similarly uncanny ability to find ever-deepening trouble that nearly ruined his life. With the birth of his son, he sobered up, reconnected with his dad, and they started their booming business together.<br><br><i>License to Pawn</i> also offers an entertaining walk through the pawn shop's history. It's a captivating look into how the Gold &amp; Silver works, with incredible stories about the crazy customers and the one-of-a-kind items that the shop sells. Rick isn't only a businessman; he's also a historian and keen observer of human nature. For instance, did you know that pimps wear lots of jewelry for a reason? It's because if they're arrested, jewelry doesn't get confiscated like cash does, and ready money will be available for bail. Or that WWII bomber jackets and Zippo lighters can sell for a freakishly high price in Japan? Have you ever heard that the makers of Ormolu clocks, which Rick sells for as much as $15,000 apiece, frequently died before forty thanks to the mercury in the paint?<br><br>Rick also reveals the items he loves so much he'll never sell. The shop has three Olympic bronze medals, a Patriots Super Bowl ring, a Samurai sword from 1490, and an original Iwo Jima battle plan. Each object has an incredible story behind it, of course. Rick shares them all, and so much more--there's an irresistible treasure trove of history behind both the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop and the life of Rick Harrison.</p><p>Rick Harrison lives in Las Vegas, NV where he is the owner-operator of the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop.</p><h2>The Forgotten Recipe (An Amish Heirloom Novel)</h2><p><p><strong>The first book in Amy Clipston&#x2019;s beloved Amish Heirloom series&#x2014;and an ECPA bestseller!</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;Amish fiction fans will enjoy this story&#x2014;and want a taste of Veronica&#x2019;s raspberry pie!&#x201d; &#x2014;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p><p><strong>After losing her fianc� in a tragic accident, Veronica Fisher finds solace in the old recipes stored in her mother&#x2019;s hope chest&#x2014;and in a special visitor who comes to her bake stand to purchase her old-fashioned raspberry pies.</strong></p><p>Veronica Fisher knows how lucky she is to be marrying her best friend.

The son of a textile magnate, he dropped out of Eton and rejected a life of privilege for a life of adventure. He traveled the world, living in Paris at the Beat Hotel and on New York&#x2019;s seedy Lower East Side, smuggled artworks into Amsterdam, and spent time in a Spanish prison for publicly making fun of Franco. Finally, he landed back in London, working in the lower echelons of the Kray Brothers&#x2019; crime syndicate laundering money, organizing illegal gambling, and setting up insurance scams. He eventually took to writing&#x2014;first as a pornographer, but then as an increasingly serious novelist, writing about the desperate characters and experiences he&#x2019;d known in London&#x2019;s underground. His work culminated in the Factory novels, landmarks that have led many to consider&nbsp; him the founding father of British noir. He died in London in 1993.<b>Praise for Derek Raymond's Factory Series</b><br><br>"Unrelenting existentialist noir&#x2014;as if the most brutal of crime fictions had been recast by Sartre, Camus, or Ionesco while retaining something of the intimate wise-guy tone of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett." <b><br>&#x2014;Joyce Carol Oates,&nbsp;<i>The New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>"It&#x2019;s one of the darkest and most surrealistically hard-boiled things I&#x2019;ve ever read.

Poortvliet, as in Gnomes and Secrets of the Gnomes , uses calligraphy and collage to create a luminous world of the past, rendered here in delicate color, with few of the vivid reds characteristic of the gnome books. The fascinating plates include desolate landscapes, loving portraits of village characters, detailed sketches of farm animals, schematic drawings from toy catalogues and historic family documents (in Dutch, but translated into English) that include birth, wedding, death and mortgage certificates. Skeletons in the Poortvliet closet are present along with the more respectable burgers: church records from the 17th century charge one grandfather with drunkenness, and 18th century court papers testify that another forefather was found guilty of stealing a neighbor's "housewife." (After a jail term, that particular Poortvliet packed his bags and moved to the island of Overflakkee, where the artist begins the book with his own 1944 visit to an uncle). The painter writes as well as he draws; his humorous yet down-to-earth style is charming. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Christless Christianity: The Alternative Gospel of the American Church</h2><p>Is it possible that we have left Christ out of Christianity? Is the faith and practice of American Christians today more American than Christian? These are the provocative questions Michael Horton addresses in this thoughtful, insightful book. He argues that while we invoke the name of Christ, too often Christ and the Christ-centered gospel are pushed aside. The result is a message and a faith that are, in Horton&#39;s words, &#34;trivial, sentimental, affirming, and irrelevant.&#34; This alternative &#34;gospel&#34; is a message of moralism, personal comfort, self-help, self-improvement, and individualistic religion. It trivializes God, making him a means to our selfish ends. Horton skillfully diagnoses the problem and points to the solution: a return to the unadulterated gospel of salvation.</p><p>A Prophetic Wake-up Call for the American Church<br><br>Is it possible that we have left Christ out of Christianity? Are the faith and practice of American Christians today more American than Christian? Have we allowed the church to be taken captive to the prevailing culture? These are the provocative questions Michael Horton addresses in this thoughtful, insightful book. His analysis should give us pause as we consider the current state of Christianity--even evangelical Christianity--in America.<br><br>"Horton confronts modern evangelicalism in terms reminiscent of J. Gresham Machen's challenge to liberalism in the 1920s. Both authors spotlight flaws that do more than distort Christian faith; they reject it. Horton's brush is broad--expect loud lamentation from the evangelical camp--but the picture he paints is largely accurate. His argument is convincing: therapeutic moralism has, in fact, found a home among evangelicals."--Parker T. Williamson, editor emeritus and senior correspondent, <i>The Presbyterian Layman<br></i><br>"<i>Christless Christianity </i>makes an important contribution in defense of the centrality of Christ to vibrant Christian life and witness. Horton has ably helped us see the train wreck that is so much of popular Christianity. While others are legitimately concerned with errors originating in the academy, errors that excite the intellectual but few average pew sitters are even aware of, Horton turns his sharp mind to exposing the mass production of a kinder, happier legalism that robs the average Christian of the liberating joy of knowing the Jesus whose work is finished and never improved. A more important and timely volume could not have been written."--Thabiti M. Anyabwile, senior pastor, First Baptist Church of Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands<br><br>"<i>Christless Christianity</i> establishes Michael Horton as the outstanding protagonist for classical Protestant orthodoxy. His wide-ranging and carefully researched examples show how our churches and megachurches have pandered to the culture with Gnostic, Pelagian, moralistic, and self-help heresies bereft of the saving action of Jesus Christ. He leaves us with a profound trust and a sure confidence in our biblical faith. What could be more important?"--Episcopal Bishop C. FitzSimons AllisonInvoking Martin Luther's treatise <i>On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church</i>, Michael Horton fears that the church in America has also been willingly taken captive. The captors are American culture and ideals: consumerism, pragmatism, self-sufficiency, individualism, positive thinking, personal prosperity, and nationalism. Though these are antithetical to the gospel, we have often made them part and parcel with it. <br><br>Horton argues that while we haven't yet arrived at Christless Christianity, we are well on our way. Though we invoke the name of Christ, too often Christ and the Christ-centered gospel are pushed aside. The result is a message and a faith that are, in Horton's words, "trivial, sentimental, affirming, and irrelevant." This alternative "gospel" is a message of moralism, personal comfort, self-help, self-improvement, and individualistic religion. It trivializes God, making him a means to our selfish ends. Horton skillfully diagnoses the problem and points to the solution: a return to the unadulterated gospel of salvation.

How can we continue to love&#x2013;to keep our minds in a happy mood&#x2013;when life is complex, difficult, and, often, disappointing? Bestselling author and beloved teacher Sylvia Boorstein asked herself these questions when she started to write this inspiring new book. The result is her best work to date, offering warm, wise, and helpful ways we can experience happiness even when the odds are against us.<br><br>As Boorstein has discovered in more than three decades of practice as a professional psychotherapist, the secret to happiness lies in actively cultivating our capacity to connect with kindness: with ourselves; with friends, family, colleagues; with those we may not know well; and even with those we may not like. She draws from the heart of Buddhist teachings to show how Wise Effort, Wise Mindfulness, and Wise Concentration can lead us away from anger, anxiety, and confusion, and into calmness, clarity, and the joy of living in the present. These qualities strengthen our ability to meet encounters of every kind with balance and intelligence, providing us with a grounded sense of true contentment.<br><br>Happiness Is an Inside Job resonates with the knowledge of a psychotherapist, the compassion of a spiritual teacher, and the wisdom of a grandmother.

It&#x2019;s your fault!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I mean. It&#x2019;s your fault we&#x2019;re late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s not. Prove it to me that it&#x2019;s my fault.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to prove anything to you. It just is.&#x201d;<br><br>I glanced behind me, as if looking beyond them, and saw that they were young, casually dressed, and apparently (was it tennis rackets, golf gear?) were going on holiday together.<br><br>The Ping-Pong recriminations continued. &#x201c;Your fault.&#x201d; &#x201c;No, yours.&#x201d;<br><br>I had a momentary impulse to turn around and say, &#x201c;Listen to me! It does not matter one bit whose fault it is. Either you&#x2019;ll be in time for your flight or you won&#x2019;t. And if you miss this flight, there will be others. What&#x2019;s more, you don&#x2019;t know that this flight is the best one to be on. Perhaps this one will have engine trouble and the next one will arrive safely. Relax! You are ruining the beginning of your holiday with a useless skirmish.&#x201d;<br><br>Of course, I didn&#x2019;t say anything. I think I could have gotten away with it if I had done it sweetly enough, but I imagined them telling someone later, &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t believe what this wacky little old woman in the airport . . .&#x201d; Anyway, eavesdropping and intruding are both impolite, even if unintended and well meaning.<br><br>I took off my jacket and shoes and pushed them through the X-ray machine along with my carry-on bag with my computer out for inspection. Retrieving my possessions on the other side, balancing on one foot and then the other to hurriedly put on my shoes, I noticed the couple just in front of me, also just emerged through the sensor gate, taking a moment to kiss each other, give each other a hug. I was amused by the thought that they were congratulating each other for having made it through the security hurdle unscathed. It was the briefest of exchanges of affection, but it was there. Right in the middle of getting re-dressed. Then I thought, &#x201c;I should call the attention of the arguing folks behind me to the kissing folks in front of me. &#x2018;Look,&#x2019; I could tell them, &#x2018;here is another possibility. In fact, there are only two possibilities in any moment. You can kiss or you can fight. Kissing is better.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Of course, I said nothing and went on to my flight. I also knew then, as I know now as I write, that in situations where I feel stressed, I might behave like the couple behind me. Not even &#x201c;long ago, when I wasn&#x2019;t wise,&#x201d; but right now, when I presumably understand that struggling with anything to make it be other than what it is creates suffering. If my mind becomes confused, broadsided by a challenge that upsets it, even a &#x201c;minor&#x201d; one such as &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss my plane,&#x201d; I forget, at least for a while, what I know.<br><br>Becoming wise means, for me, forgetting less often&#x2014;and remembering sooner when I&#x2019;ve forgotten&#x2014;the three things that are fundamentally true. The Buddha called these the Three Characteristics of Experience.<br><br>Everything is always changing.<br><br>There is a cause-and-effect lawfulness that governs all unfolding experience.<br><br>What I do matters, but I am not in charge. Suffering results from struggling with what is beyond my control.<br><br>The line from the Dhammapada, a compilation of say- ings attributed to the Buddha, that sums this up for me, that seems the one-sentence best expression of wisdom, is: &#x201c;Anyone who understands impermanence, ceases to be contentious.&#x201d;<br><br>Does that make sense to you on as many levels as it does to me? I understand it, primarily, as meaning &#x201c;I have only a certain span of life allotted to me, so I don&#x2019;t want to waste a single moment of it fighting.&#x201d; Other times, if I catch myself on the brink of contention, the instruction reminds me, &#x201c;Whatever is happening will change, and what I add to this situation is part of the change. Agonizing makes it worse.&#x201d; And sometimes, if I remember that whatever is happening will cause results that I really cannot anticipate (although I often do and worry needlessly), I say to myself, &#x201c;I have no idea whether this changed circumstance, which I resent, is actually a good or a bad thing in the long run. I can wait to see.&#x201d;<br><br>Many people have told me, when I&#x2019;ve asked for examples of wise people in their lives, &#x201c;My granddad [or grandmother or elderly neighbor of my childhood or eighth-grade math teacher] always said, &#x2018;You do the best you can, and then you live with what happens. What else can you do?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>I think in these descriptions of wisdom, the important word is always. Those wise people always said . . . They did not forget. I forget. I know&#x2014;I think we all do from innumerable events in our experience&#x2014;that the moment in which the mind acknowledges &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t what I wanted, but it&#x2019;s what I got&#x201d; is the point at which suffering disappears. Sadness might remain present, but the mind, having given up the fight for another reality, is free to console, free to support the mind&#x2019;s acceptance of the situation, free to allow space for new possibilities to come into view.<br><br>My own experience is that I keep learning this lesson, over and over again. My wisdom is definitely not unshakable. Here is an example, from all too recent an experience. I became distracted, and . . . Well, here is the story, which speaks for itself.<br><br>I went to the antique store in the town in France where I live part of each year to protest the unexpected 400-euro charge that had arrived along with the mattress and innerspring for the bed I&#x2019;d bought there. I had telephoned in advance. Madame Blaise, the antiquaire, had explained that, unfortunately, the unique size of beds made in the 1840s, especially the rounded corners, had required that a special-order mattress and springs be constructed. I was going in person to continue the discussion, but I was unhappy about going. I am, by nature, conflict-avoidant. I was urged on and accompanied by my husband, Seymour, who was angry and who does not speak French. I was caught between trying to please him and trying not to displease Madame Blaise.<br><br>&#x201c;Remind her,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;that she told us what the price of the mattress would be, that it was included with the bed, and that we already paid for it. If there is anything extra, she should pay. She is the expert. It is her responsibility.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Madame is an eighty-five-year-old small-town antiquaire,&#x201d; I countered. &#x201c;She is not Macy&#x2019;s. You can&#x2019;t undo these things.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fair, though,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;You should insist that she make amends. If you won&#x2019;t do it, I will. I&#x2019;ll pantomime how unhappy I am. Even if she won&#x2019;t give us any money back, she could at least offer us something like those bedside tables you were looking at when we bought the bed.&#x201d;<br><br>I spoke to Madame Blaise in my most elegant and polite French, explaining our shock, our dismay, and our distress about having trusted her judgment and now needing to pay the mattress company 400 euros. I looked pointedly at some of the furniture around us and suggested that she might consider making us a gift of bedside tables as a form of reparation. I ended by saying that we had enjoyed our previous meetings with her and were sad that we were now left with bad feelings, mauvaises �motions.</p><h2>Like a Tree: How Trees, Women, and Tree People Can Save the Planet</h2><p><p><i>Like a Tree</i> grew out of bestselling author Jean Bolen's practice of walking among tall trees and mourning the loss of a Monterey pine that was cut down in her neighborhood.</p><p>The book will appeal most to people who realize that they are "tree people." It is poetic, educational, inspirational, spiritual, and down to earth, covering the subject of trees from anatomy and physiology to trees as archetypal and sacred symbols.</p><p>It is also a strong and positive call to ecological activism, with stories of the organizations and "tree people" who are trying to save our forests and the planet: Greenpeace's Kleercut campaign to save the Boreal Forest, Wangari Maathai's Greenbelt Movement, Julia Butterfly Hill's campaign to save a California Redwood. Bolen offers a unique vision based on metaphysics, psychology, mythology, and global gender politics. She writes eloquently about deforestation, global warming, and overpopulation, as well as the work of Amnesty International and the UN Commission on the Status of Women. </p></p><p><b> Jean Shinoda Bolen, M.D. is a psychiatrist, Jungian analyst in private practice, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center, and an internationally known lecturer. She is the author of numerous books including <i>Goddesses in Everywoman</i>, <i>Urgent Message from Mother: Gather the Women and Save the World</i>, <i>Crones Don't Whine</i> and <i>The Millionth Circle</i>.</b>"Read Jean Shinoda Bolen's <i>Like a Tree</i>, and you will never again see one without knowing it has a novel inside, it's supporting your life, and it's more spiritual than any church, temple or mosque. <i>Like a Tree</i> is the rare book that not only informs, but offers a larger consciousness of life itself." <b>Gloria Steinem</b>, <i>Reviews</i><br><br>"I'll always remember the sadness I felt several years ago when I drove my little girl to her first day of the new school year, and saw that the huge tree that had always welcomed us as we entered the driveway in front of the school was gone. Upon inquiring about what happened, I was told that the tree had been removed to make way for a new sports field. I couldn't believe how sad I was, or how little my sadness seemed to be shared by other people at the school. It was then that I realized what a profound shift in worldview is necessary in order for us to save the planet. I applaud everyoneincluding the brilliant and glorious Jean Shinoda Bolenfor helping us make the shift. Bravo, Jean. You make us feel it." <b>Marianne Williamson</b>, <i>Reviews</i><br><br>"In this book Jean Bolen expresses the essence of our deep connection to and inseparability from trees. Trees have stood by us humans always; it is the least we can do to protect and save and honor them now. Bolen's thoughts and suggestions for moving forward will, as always, help us see and feel how this might be done. This is a conversation with the Tree tribe not to be missed or dismissed." <b>Alice Walker</b>, <i>Reviews</i><br><br>"We shouldn't simply be alarmed by what's happening to our forests, and our other fellow creatures. We should feel sick to our soul. And in this, as Jean Bolen says, women are taking the lead and showing, all over the world, that 'ordinary people' can make a differenceand that if they don't, nobody else will. Altogether, an excellent and timely book." <b>Colin Tudge</b>, biologist and author of <i>The Tree: A Natural History of What Trees Are, How They Live, and Why They Matter</i>, <i>Reviews</i></p><h2>Lone Star Cafe</h2><p>Publishers Weekly The second book in Wingate&#39;s Texas trilogy (after Texas Cooking) serves up a charmingly nostalgic treat.

He is an internationally renowned lecturer, teacher, and psychologist and has taught at Yale, Syracuse, and the University of Chicago.One sentence in one scene from one film, Patton, sums up what this book tries to understand. The general walks the field after a battle. Churned earth, burned tanks, dead men. He takes up a dying officer, kisses him, surveys the havoc and says: &#x201c;I love it. God help me, I do love it so. I love it more than my life.&#x201d;<br><br>We can never prevent war or speak sensibly of peace and disarmament unless we enter this love of war. Unless we move our imaginations into the martial state of soul, we cannot comprehend its pull. This means &#x201c;going to war,&#x201d; and this book aims to induct our minds into military service. We are not going to war in the name of peace, as deceitful rhetoric so often declares, but rather for war&#x2019;s own sake: to understand the madness of its love.<br><br>Our civilian disdain and pacifist horror&#x2014;all the legitimate and deep-felt aversion to everything to do with the military and the warrior&#x2014;must be set aside. This because the first principle of psychological method holds that any phenomenon to be understood must be sympathetically imagined. No syndrome can be truly dislodged from its cursed condition unless we first move imagination into its heart.<br><br>War is first of all a psychological task, perhaps the first of all psychological tasks because it directly threatens your life and mine, and the existence of all living beings. The bell tolls for thee, and all. Nothing can escape thermonuclear rage, and if the burning and its aftermath are unimaginable, their cause, war, is not.<br><br>War is also a psychological task because philosophy and theology, the fields supposed to do the heavy thinking for our species, have neglected war&#x2019;s overriding importance. &#x201c;War is the father of all,&#x201d; said Heraclitus at the beginnings of Western thought. If it is a primordial component of Being, then war fathers the very structure of existence and our thinking about it: our ideas of the universe, of God, of ethics; war determines the thought patterns of Aristotle&#x2019;s logic of opposites, Kant&#x2019;s antimonies, Darwin&#x2019;s natural selection, Marx&#x2019;s struggle of classes and even Freud&#x2019;s repression of the id by the ego and super-ego. We think in warlike terms, feel ourselves at war with ourselves, and unknowingly believe predation, territorial defense, conquest, and the interminable battle of opposing forces are the ground rules of existence...;.<br><br>War is becoming more normalized every day. Trade war, gender war, net war, information war. But war against cancer, war against crime, against drugs, against poverty and other ills of society has nothing to do with the actualities of war. These civil wars, wars within civilian society, mobilize resources in the name of a heroic victory over an insidious enemy. These wars are noble good guys against bad guys and no one gets hurt. This way of normalizing war has whitewashed the word and brainwashed us so that we forget its terrible images. Then whenever the possibility of actual war approaches with its reality of violent death-dealing combat, the idea of war has been normalized into nothing more than putting more cops on the street, more rats in the lab, and passing tax rebates for urban renewal.<br><br>I base the statement &#x201c;war is normal&#x201d; on two factors we have already seen: its constancy throughout history and its ubiquity over the globe. These two factors require another more basic one: acceptability. Wars could not happen unless there were those willing to help them happen. Conscripts, slaves, indentured soldiers, unwilling draftees to the contrary, there are always masses ready to answer the call to arms, to join up, to get in the fight. There are always leaders rushing to take the plunge. Every nation has its hawks. Moreover, resisters, dissenters, pacifists, objectors, and deserters are rarely able to bring war to a halt. The saying &#x201c;Someday they&#x2019;ll give a war and no one will come&#x201d; remains a fond wish. War drives everything else off the front page.</p><h2>William Bradford: Pilgrim Boy</h2><p>Interesting biography, published by Beautiful Feet Books, of Bradford&#39;s childhood.

Jack Taylor tells himself that it&#x2019;s got nothing to do with him. He has enough to do just staying sane. His close friend Ridge is recovering from surgery, and alcohol&#x2019;s siren song is calling to him ever more insistently.</p><p>A guard and then a judge die in mysterious circumstances. But it is not until a child is added to the list that Taylor determines to find the identity of the killer, and stop them at any cost. What he doesn&#x2019;t know is that his relationship with the killer is far closer than he thinks. And it&#x2019;s about to become deeply personal.</p><p>Spiked with dark humor, and fueled with rage at man&#x2019;s inhumanity to man, this is crime writing at its darkest and most original.</p></p><p><p>Ken Bruen has been a finalist for the Edgar and Anthony Awards, and has won a Macavity Award, a Barry Award, and two Shamus Awards for the Jack Taylor series.&nbsp;He has been an English teacher in Africa, Japan, Southeast Asia, and South America.&nbsp;He lives in Galway, Ireland.</p>At the start of Edgar-finalist Bruen's lean seventh Jack Taylor novel, the aging, alcoholic Irish ex-cop, who moved to the U.S. in 2008's <i>The Cross</i>, knows he really ought to be in America, but he's staying in Galway because his old police partner, Ridge, has developed breast cancer. Meanwhile, he's received a shopping list of intended victims&#x2014;two guards, one nun, one judge and one child&#x2014;from the mysterious Benedictus. One is already dead, killed in an unfortunate hit and run, according to Superintendent Clancy, Taylor's best friend from years earlier on the force, who dismisses Taylor's fear that a serial killer is on the loose. Bruen's trademark terse style is more perfunctory than not, and parts of the narrative read like an outline, as shown by previous cases synopsized in quick asides. Taylor confronts the unlikely killer in what is a less than convincing showdown. Still, series fans should follow Taylor's current fall off the wagon, suffused by the mellow glow of Xanax, with the usual passionate interest. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Despite this impressive martial heritage, success in the military seemed unlikely for Allen as he failed out of West Point&#x2014;twice&#x2014;ultimately gaining his commission through Catholic University&#x2019;s R.O.T.C. program. In World War I, the young officer commanded an infantry battalion and distinguished himself as a fearless combat leader, personally leading patrols into no-man&#x2019;s-land.<br><br>In 1940, with another world war looming, newly appointed army chief of staff Gen. George C. Marshall reached down through the ranks and, ahead of almost a thousand more senior colonels, promoted Patton, Eisenhower, Allen, and other younger officers to brigadier general. <br><br>For Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa, Allen, now a two-star general, commanded the Big Red One, the First Infantry Division, spearheading the American attack against the Nazis. Despite a stellar combat record, however, Major General Allen found himself in hot water with the big brass. Allen and his troops had become notorious for their lack of discipline off the battlefield. When Seventh Army commander George Patton was pressed by his deputy Omar Bradley to replace &#x201c;Terrible Terry&#x201d; before the invasion of Sicily, he demurred, favoring Allen&#x2019;s success in combat. At the end of the Sicily campaign, with Allen&#x2019;s protector Patton out of the way (relieved for slapping a soldier), Omar Bradley fired Allen and sent him packing back to the States, seemingly in terminal disgrace.<br><br>Once again, however, George Marshall reached down and in October 1944, Terrible Terry was given command of another infantry division, the 104th Timberwolves and took it into heavy combat in Belgium. Hard fighting continued as Allen&#x2019;s division spearheaded the U.S. First Army&#x2019;s advance across Germany. On 26 April 1945, Terrible Terry Allen&#x2019;s hard-charging Timberwolves became the first American outfit to link up with the Soviet Union&#x2019;s Red Army.<br><br>Terrible Terry Allen was one of the most remarkable American soldiers of World War II or any war. Hard bitten, profane, and combative, Allen disdained the &#x201c;book,&#x201d; but he knew how to wage war.

The air was heavy and stank of drying mussels and the crust of salt on the jetties. Waves tossed themselves against the shore, dragging grit and sand between their nails as they were slowly pulled back out to sea.<br> <br>The moon was high and pale in the sky, but the sun was just going down.<br> <br>It was so good to be able to breathe, Kaye thought. She loved the serene brutality of the ocean, loved the electric power she felt with each breath of wet, briny air. She spun again, dizzily, not caring that her skirt was flying up over the tops of her black thigh-high stockings.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Janet called. She stepped over the overflowing, leaf-choked gutter, wobbling slightly on fat-heeled platform shoes. Her glitter makeup sparkled under the street lamps. Janet exhaled ghosts of blue smoke and took another drag on her cigarette. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to fall.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kaye and her mother had been staying at her grandmother&#x2019;s a week already, and even though Ellen kept saying they&#x2019;d be leaving soon, Kaye knew they really had nowhere to go. Kaye was glad. She loved the big old house caked with dust and mothballs. She liked the sea being so close and the air not stinging her throat.<br> <br>The cheap hotels they passed were long closed and boarded up, their pools drained and cracked. Even the arcades were shut down, prizes in the claw machines still visible through the cloudy glass windows. Rust marks above an abandoned storefront outlined the words SALT WATER TAFFY.<br> <br>Janet dug through her tiny purse and pulled out a wand of strawberry lipgloss. Kaye spun up to her, fake leopard coat flying open, a run already in her stocking. Her boots had sand stuck to the tops of them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go swimming,&#x201d; Kaye said. She was giddy with night air, burning like the white-hot moon. Everything smelled wet and feral like it did before a thunderstorm, and she wanted to run, swift and eager, beyond the edge of what she could see.<br> <br>&#x201c;The water&#x2019;s freezing,&#x201d; Janet said, sighing, &#x201c;and your hair is fucked up. Kaye, when we get there, you have to be cool. Don&#x2019;t seem so weird. Guys don&#x2019;t like weird.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kaye paused and seemed to be listening intently, her upturned, kohl-rimmed eyes watching Janet as warily as a cat&#x2019;s. &#x201c;What should I be like?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that I want you to be a certain way&#x2014;don&#x2019;t you want a boyfriend?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why bother with that?

There was only a little more than a slice of red where the sea met the sky.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, what?&#x201d; Janet said, holding the lipgloss out to Kaye.<br> <br>&#x201c;Like he slit his wrists in a bathtub and the blood is all over the water.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s gross, Kaye.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And the moon is just watching. She&#x2019;s just watching him die. She must have driven him to it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Kaye . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Kaye spun again, laughing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are you always making shit up? That&#x2019;s what I mean by weird.&#x201d; Janet was speaking loudly, but Kaye could barely hear her over the wind and the sound of her own laughter.<br> <br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Kaye. Remember the faeries you used to tell stories about? What was his name?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which one? Spike or Gristle?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Exactly. You made them up!&#x201d; Janet said. &#x201c;You always make things up.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kaye stopped spinning, cocking her head to one side, fingers sliding into her pockets. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>The old merry-go-round building had been semi-abandoned for years. Angelic lead faces, surrounded by rays of hair, divided the broken panes. The entire front of it was windowed, revealing the dirt floor, glass glittering against the refuse. Inside, a crude plywood skateboarding ramp was the only remains of an attempt to use the building commercially in the last decade.<br> <br>Kaye could hear voices echoing in the still air all the way to the street. Janet dropped her cigarette into the gutter. It hissed and was quickly carried away, sitting on the water like a spider.<br> <br>Kaye hoisted herself up onto the outside ledge and swung her legs over. The window was long gone, but her leg scraped against glass residue as she slid in, fraying her stockings further.<br> <br>Layers of paint muted the once-intricate moldings inside the carousel building. The ramp in the center of the room was tagged by local spray-paint artists and covered with band stickers and ballpoint pen scrawlings. And then there were the boys.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kaye Fierch, you remember me, right?&#x201d; Doughboy chuckled. He was short and thin, despite his name.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think you threw a bottle at my head in sixth grade.&#x201d;<br> <br>He laughed again. &#x201c;Right. Right. I forgot that. You&#x2019;re not still mad?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said, but her merry mood drained out of her. Janet climbed on top of the skateboard ramp to where Kenny was sitting, a king in his silver flight jacket, watching the proceedings. Handsome, with dark hair and darker eyes. He held up a nearly full bottle of tequila in greeting.<br> <br>Marcus introduced himself by handing over the bottle he&#x2019;d been drinking from, making a mock throwing motion before letting her take it. A little splashed on the sleeve of his flannel shirt. &#x201c;Bourbon. Expensive shit.&#x201d;<br> <br>She forced a smile. Marcus resumed gutting a cigar. Even hunched over, he was a big guy. The brown skin on his head gleamed, and she could see where he must have nicked himself shaving.<br> <br>&#x201c;I brought you some candy,&#x201d; Janet said to Kenny. She had candy corn and peanut chews.<br> <br>&#x201c;I brought you some candy,&#x201d; Doughboy mocked in a high, squeaky voice, jumping up on the ramp. &#x201c;Give it here,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Kaye walked around the room. It was magnificent, old and decayed and fine. The slow burn of bourbon in her throat was perfect for this place, the sort of thing a man in a summer suit who always wore a hat might drink.<br> <br>&#x201c;What flavor of Asian are you?&#x201d; Marcus asked. He had filled the cigar with weed and was chomping down on one end. The thick, sweet smell almost choked her.<br> <br>She took another swallow from the bottle and tried to ignore him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kaye! You hear me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m half Japanese.&#x201d; Kaye touched her hair, blond as her mother&#x2019;s. It was the hair that baffled people.<br> <br>&#x201c;Man, you ever see the cartoons there? They have them little, little girls with these pigtails and shit in these short school uniforms. We should have uniforms like that here, man. You ever wear one of those, huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shut up, dickhead,&#x201d; Janet said, laughing. &#x201c;She went to grade school with Doughboy and me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kenny looped one finger through the belt rings of Janet&#x2019;s jeans and pulled her over to kiss her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, well, damn.&#x201d; Marcus laughed. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t you hold up your hair in those pigtails for a second or something? Come on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kaye shook her head. No, she wouldn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Marcus and Doughboy started to play Hacky Sack with an empty beer bottle. It didn&#x2019;t break as they kicked it boot to boot, but it made a hollow sound. She took another long swallow of bourbon. Her head was already buzzing pleasantly, humming in time with imagined merry-go-round music. She moved farther into the dim room, to where old placards announced popcorn and peanuts for five cents apiece.<br> <br>Against the far wall was a black, weathered door. It opened jerkily when she pushed it. Moonlight from the windows in the main room revealed only an office with an old desk and a corkboard, yellowed menus still pinned to it. She stepped inside, even though the light switch didn&#x2019;t work. In a shadowed corner, she found a knob. This door led to a stairwell with only a little light drifting down from the top. She felt her way up the stairs. Dust covered the palms of her hands as she slid them along the railings. She sneezed loudly, then sneezed again.<br> <br>At the top was a small window lit by the murderess moon, ripe and huge in the sky. Interesting boxes were stacked in the corners. Then her eyes fell on the horse, and she forgot all the rest. He was magnificent&#x2014;gleaming pearl white and covered with tiny pieces of glued-down mirror. His face was painted with red and purple and gold, and he even had a bar of white teeth and a painted pink tongue with enough space to tuck a sugar cube. It was obvious why he&#x2019;d been left behind&#x2014;his legs on all four sides and part of his tail had been shattered. Splinters hung down from where they used to be.<br> <br>Gristle would have loved this. She had thought that many times since she had left the Shore, six years past. My imaginary friends would have loved this. She&#x2019;d thought it the first time that she&#x2019;d seen the city, lit up like never-ending Christmas. But they never came when she was in Philadelphia. And now she was sixteen and felt like she had no imagination left.<br> <br>Kaye set the bourbon on the dusty floor and dropped her coat next to it. Then she tried to set the horse up as if he were standing on his ruined stumps. It wobbled unsteadily but didn&#x2019;t fall. She swung one leg over the beast and dropped onto its saddle, using her feet to keep it steady. She ran her hands down its mane, which was carved in golden ringlets. She touched the painted black eyes and the chipped ears.<br> <br>The white horse rose on unsteady legs in her mind. The great bulk of the animal was real and warm beneath her. She wove her hands in the mane and gripped hard, slightly aware of a prickling feeling all through her limbs. The horse whinnied softly beneath her, ready to leap out into the cold, black water. She threw back her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kaye?&#x201d; A soft voice snapped her out of her daydream. Kenny was standing near the stairs, regarding her blankly. For a moment, though, she was still fierce. Then she felt her cheeks burning.<br> <br>Caught in the half-light, she could see him better than she had downstairs. Two heavy silver hoops shone in the lobes of his ears. His short, cinnamon hair was mussed and had a slight wave to it, matching the beginnings of a goatee on his chin. Under the flight jacket, his too-tight white T-shirt showed off his body.<br> <br>He moved toward her, reaching his hand out and then looking at it oddly, as though he didn&#x2019;t remember deciding to do that. Instead he petted the head of the horse, slowly, almost hypnotically.<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I saw what you did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Janet?&#x201d; Kaye wasn&#x2019;t sure what he meant. She would have thought he was teasing her except for his serious face, his slow way of speaking.<br> <br>He was stroking the animal&#x2019;s mane now. &#x201c;She was worried about you.&#x201d; His hand fascinated her despite herself. It seemed like he was tangling it in imaginary hair. &#x201c;How did you make it do that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do what?&#x201d; She was afraid now, afraid and flattered both. There was no mocking or teasing in his face.<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw it stand up.&#x201d; His voice was so low she could almost pretend that she didn&#x2019;t hear him right. His hand dropped to her thigh and slid upward to the cotton crotch of her panties.<br> <br>Even though she had seen the slow progression of his hand, the touch startled her. She was paralyzed for a moment before she sprang up, letting the horse fall as she did. It crashed down, knocking the bottle of bourbon over, dark liquor pouring over her coat and soaking the bottoms of the dusty boxes like the tide coming in at night.<br> <br>He grabbed for her before she could think, his hand catching hold of the neck of her shirt. She stepped back, off-balance, and fell, her shirt ripping open over her bra even as he let go of it.<br> <br>Shoes pounded up the stairs.<br> <br>&#x201c;What the fuck?&#x201d; Marcus was at the top of the stairwell with Doughboy, trying to shove his way in for a look.<br> <br>Kenny shook his head and looked around numbly while Kaye scrambled for her bourbon-soaked coat.<br> <br>The boys moved out of the way, and Janet was there, too, staring.<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; Janet asked, looking between them in confusion. Kaye pushed past her, shoving her hand through an armhole of the coat as she threw it over her back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kaye!&#x201d; Janet called.<br> <br>Kaye ignored her, taking the stairs two at a time in the dark. There was nothing she could say that would explain what had happened.<br> <br>She could hear Janet shouting. &#x201c;What did you do to her? What the fuck did you do?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kaye ran across the carousel hall and swung her leg over the sill. The bits of glass she&#x2019;d mostly avoided earlier slashed a thin line on the outside of her thigh as she dropped into the sandy soil and weeds.<br> <br>The cold wind felt good against her hot face.<br> <br><br> <br>Cornelius Stone picked up the new box of computer crap and hauled it into his bedroom to drop next to the others. Each time his mother came home from the flea market with a cracked monitor, sticky keyboard, or just loads of wires, she had that hopeful look that made Corny want to scream. She just couldn&#x2019;t comprehend the difference between a 286 and a quantum computer. She couldn&#x2019;t understand that the age of guerilla engineering was at a close, that being a motherfucking genius wasn&#x2019;t enough. You needed to be a rich motherfucking genius.<br> <br>He dropped the box, kicked it hard three times, picked up his denim jacket with the devil&#x2019;s head on the back, and made for the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you use that stuff, honey?&#x201d; His mother was in Janet&#x2019;s room, folding a new pair of secondhand jeans. She held up a T-shirt with rhinestone cats on it. &#x201c;Think your sister will like it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Ma,&#x201d; he said through gritted teeth. &#x201c;I got to get to work.&#x201d; He walked past The Husband, who was stooped over, getting a beer from the case under the kitchen table. The white cat was waddling along the countertop, its belly dragging with another pregnancy, screaming for canned food or pickles and ice cream or something. He petted its head grudgingly, but before it began rubbing against his hand in earnest, he opened the screen door and went out into the lot.<br> <br>The cool October air was a relief from the recirculated cigarette smoke.<br> <br>Corny loved his car. It was a primer-colored Chevy blooming with rust spots and an inner lining that hung like baggy skin from the roof. He knew what he looked like. Beaky. Skinny and tall with bad hair and worse skin. He lived down to his name. Cornelius. Corny. Corn-dog. But not in his car. Inside, he was anonymous.<br> <br>Every day for the last three weeks he had left a little earlier for work. He would go to the convenience store and buy some food. Then he would drive around, wondering what it would be like to just get on the highway and go, go, go until the gas ran out.<br> <br>Tonight, he bought a cup of coffee and a package of black licorice. He lingered over a paperback with an embossed metallic dragon on the cover, reading the first few sentences, hoping something would interest him. The game was becoming boring. Worse than boring, it made him feel more pathetic than before. Nearly a week before Halloween and all, he...</p><h2>We Need Silence to Find Out What We Think: Selected Essays</h2><p>Spanning the 1960s to the 2000s, these nonfiction writings showcase Shirley Hazzard's extensive thinking on global politics, international relations, the history and fraught present of Western literary culture, and postwar life in Europe and Asia. They add essential clarity to the themes that dominate her award-winning fiction and expand the intellectual registers in which her writings work.<br><br>Hazzard writes about her employment at the United Nations and the institution's manifold failings. She shares her personal experience with the aftermath of the Hiroshima atomic bombing and the nature of life in late-1940s Hong Kong.

A 2007 poll of 4,000 Britons named him as one of the world's "100 living geniuses." His website company, Optimnem, has provided foreign language instruction to thousands around the globe and his last book, the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant</i>, has been translated into 18 languages. He lives in Avignon, in the south of France.Although Daniel Tammet is only 27, as an autistic savant with Asperger's syndrome, he has already lived an unusual life. Strict routines are necessary� the same number of flakes of porridge for breakfast and cups of tea at exactly the same time each day. He can recite pi to 22,514 places from memory, and he learned Icelandic in a week. He experiences synesthesia, which makes him see numbers and letters as shapes and colors and emotions. (He was born on a Wednesday, which is a blue day.) Simon Vance enhances this memoir with a sensitive performance. He affects an almost imperceptible awkwardness of speech to capture the spirit of Tammet as an extraordinary and successful individual.

Drawn from Friday's personal interviews and letters, <i>Women on Top</i> contains transcripts of real sexual fantasies that will change your mind-set about women and sex. A revolutionary exploration of female eroticism, <i>Women on Top</i> reveals the powerful and astounding sexual attitudes that are forever changing our intimate lives.</p><p><b>Nancy Friday</b> is the bestselling author of <i>My Secret Garden, Jealousy, Men in Love, My Mother/My Self, Women on Top, The Power of Beauty</i> and, most recently, <i>Our Looks, Our Lives.</i> She lives in Key West, Florida, and in Connecticut.<b>Part 1: Report from the Erotic Interior</b><br><br>It's an odd time to be writing about sex. Not at all like the late 1960s and 1970s, when the air was charged with sexual curiosity, women's lives were changing at a rate of geometric progression, and the exploration of women's sexuality -- well, it ranked right up there with the struggle for economic equality.<br><br>Today's sexual climate is somber. Gone are the lively debates and writings about sex as part of our humanity. The toll of AIDS, reports from the abortion battlefield, and the alarming rise of unintended pregnancies make sex seem more risky than joyful.<br><br>By their sheer numbers young men and women twenty years ago made sex a burning issue; later when the time came to go on to more "serious" business, they put the sexual revolution to bed. Implicit in the prim set of their lips today is that they overdid it twenty years ago; like good Calvinist children the Establishment now punishes itself for its former naughty excesses and righteously turns its back on sex. Because they are still the majority who make the rules and write the headlines, they assume they speak for everyone.<br><br>They know little of the women in this book.<br><br>These women are for the most part in their twenties, the generation that followed the sexual revolution and the initial momentum of the women's movement. Their voices sound like a new race of women compared to those in <i>My Secret Garden,</i> my first book on women's sexual fantasies, which was published in 1973 and is now in its twenty-ninth printing. While they have all read that earlier book and taken heart from it, these young women accept their sexual fantasies as a natural extension of their lives. Given the unique period in women's history in which they grew up, how could it be otherwise?<br><br>For them the explosive emotions we unleashed in the 1970s are still very much alive. There has never been a sexual hiatus, a cooling-off period. Sex is a given, an energy not to be deferred for "more important things." Their sexual fantasies are startling reflections of their determination to abandon nothing.<br><br>Here is a collective imagination that could not have existed twenty years ago, when women had no vocabulary, no permission, and no shared identity in which to describe their sexual feelings. Those first voices were tentative and filled with guilt, not for having done anything but simply for daring to admit the inadmissible: that they had erotic thoughts that sexually aroused them.<br><br>More than any other emotion, guilt determined the story lines of the fantasies in <i>My Secret Garden.</i> Here were hundreds of women inventing ploys to get past their fear that wanting to reach orgasm made them Bad Girls. All in the privacy of their own minds, where no one would know. But in the mind of the symbiotic child, mother did know. The daughter could be grown and with children of her own, but if she had never emotionally separated from that first person who controlled her totally, how was she to know what was mother's opinion, what was her own? It was as if mother continued to sit in judgment throughout the daughter's life, wagging her finger at the daughter's every sexual move and thought.<br><br>The most popular guilt-avoiding device was the so-called rape fantasy -- "so-called" because no rape, bodily harm, or humiliation took place in the fantasy. It simply had to be understood that what went on was against the woman's will. Saying she was "raped" was the most expedient way of getting past the big No to sex that had been imprinted on her mind since early childhood. (Let me add that the women were emphatic that these were not suppressed wishes; I never encountered a woman who said she really wanted to be raped.)<br><br>Anonymity also helped. The men in these fantasies were faceless strangers invented to further insure the women against involvement, responsibility, the possibility of a relationship. These males did their job and left. Being fucked by the faceless stranger made it doubly clear: "This pleasure is not my fault! I'm still a Nice Girl, Mom."<br><br>Certainly sexual guilt hasn't disappeared, nor has the rape fantasy. There is something very workmanlike and reliable about the traditional bullies and bad people whose intractable presence allows the woman to reach her goal, orgasm. But most of the women in this book take guilt as a given, like the danger of speeding cars. Guilt, they've learned, comes from without, from mother, from church. Sex comes from within and is their entitlement. Guilt, therefore, must be controlled, mastered, and used to heighten excitement. If there is a rape fantasy, today's woman is just as likely to flip the scenario into one in which she overpowers and rapes the man. This sort of thing just didn't happen in <i>My Secret Garden.</i><br><br>Fantasy is where the sexual drive does battle with opposing emotions, the selection of which comes out of our individual lives, our earliest sexual histories. What were the forbidden feelings we took in as we grew? In these new fantasies, the emotions that most often dictate the story lines are anger, the desire for control, and the determination to experience the fullest sexual release.<br><br>Admitting to anger is new for women. In the days of <i>My Secret Garden,</i> nice women didn't express anger. They choked on it and turned whatever rage they felt against themselves.<br><br>Anger is still a difficult emotion for women to voice in reality, primarily because we get no practice expressing it in that first, most important relationship, opposite mother. But women today at least know they are entitled to anger, and fantasy is a safe playground where they can show rage at all the obstacles that stand in their way, beginning with rage at the enormous difficulty in being sexual plus all the other things a woman today must be. These new women have no models, no blueprints. They have to make themselves up. One of the ways they try out new roles is in their erotic dreams.<br><br>Don't misunderstand me; this is not just a book about angry women. These are women's voices finally dealing with the full lexicon of human emotion, sexual imagery and language. Anger is inextricably involved with lust in reality as well as in the erotic imagination. Men's sexual fantasies are also filled with rage at war with eroticism. They take a different story line from women's largely because of men's earliest experiences with woman/mother. But rage is a human emotion, and though history until recently tells us otherwise, it is not exclusive to one sex.<br><br>I will never forget these women, for they have swept me up in their enthusiasm and taught me too. "Take that!" they say, using their erotic muscle to seduce or subdue anyone or anything that stands in the way of orgasm. They take the knowledge won by an earlier generation of women who couldn't use it themselves, still being too close to the taboos against which they rebelled. These women look mother square in the face and have their orgasm too.<br><br>I have always believed that our erotic daydreams are the true X rays of our sexual souls, and like our dreams at night they change as new people and situations enter our lives to be played out against the primitive backdrop of our childhood. An analyst collects his patients' dreams like gold coins. We should value our erotic reveries no less seriously, because they are the complex expressions of what we consciously desire and unconsciously fear. To know them is to know ourselves better.<br><br>Like the X ray of a broken bone held up to the light, a fantasy reveals the healthy line of human sexual desire and shows where this conscious wish to feel sexual has been shattered by a fear so old and threatening as to be unconscious pressure. As children we feared that the sexual feeling would lose us the love of someone upon whom we depended for life itself; the guilt, planted early and deep, arose because we didn't want the forbidden sexual feeling to go away. Now it is fantasy's job to get us past the fear/guilt/anxiety. The characters and story lines we conjure up take what was most forbidden, and with the omnipotent power of the mind, make the forbidden work for us so that now, just for a moment, we may rise to orgasm and release.<br><br>Here, for the first time, these women's voices make it undeniably clear that our erotic fantasies have changed in juxtaposition to what has happened in the past years; they are not simply masturbatory diversions, derivatives of <i>Playboy</i> cartoons, but brilliant insights into what motivates real life -- clues to our identity as valuable as the dreams we dream at night.<br><br>This is not a scientific report. I am by choice not a Ph.D., having decided long ago to retain the writer's freedom. Also, it has always been my belief that women tell me things they say they've never told a living soul because I am Nancy to them and not Dr. Friday. This book, along with <i>My Secret Garden</i> and <i>Forbidden Flowers,</i> its sequel, represent a unique chronicle of women's sexual fantasies. Before <i>My Secret Garden</i> was published, there was nothing on the subject. The assumption was that women did not have sexual fantasies.<br><br>The sexual fantasies in <i>Women on Top</i> cover the years from 1980 to the present. They were selected from interviews and letters written to me in answer to an invitation to women who wished to contribute to a future book on women's sexual fantasies.

Box number and promised anonymity.<br><br>My contributors and I may form a special population: I am sufficiently fascinated by sexuality to write about it, and they to read my books and then write to me for reasons ranging from the desire for validation of their sexuality -- "I am signing my real name because I want you to know I exist!" -- to the exhibitionistic pleasure of seeing their words in print. But there can be no doubt that those who have written speak for a far larger population.<br><br>I have chosen to arrange the fantasies in three chapters which denote the themes that most frequently turned up in the thousands of letters and interviews I collected since my earlier books: women in control, women with women, and sexually insatiable women. I've arranged them in chronological order so that we could see how changes in the real world influence the erotic imagination.<br><br>Let me tell you how I came to this subject. In the late 1960s I chose to write about women's sexual fantasies because the subject was unbroken ground, a missing piece in the puzzle, and I loved original research. I had sexual fantasies and I assumed other women did too. But when I spoke to friends and people in the publishing world, they said they'd never heard of a woman's sexual fantasy. Nor was there a single reference to women's sexual fantasies in the card catalogues at the New York Public Library, the Yale University library, or the British Museum library, which carry millions upon millions of books -- not a word on the sexual imagery in the minds of half the world.<br><br>Publishers were intrigued, however, for it was a time in history when the world was suddenly curious about sex and women's sexuality in particular. Editors were frantically signing up any writer who could help flesh out this undiscovered continent called Woman.<br><br>I remember vividly the first publisher who rejected <i>My Secret Garden.</i> When I mentioned the outline I had drawn up along with a sampling of fantasies, he salivated. "Women's sexual fantasies!" he juicily exclaimed, and then pleaded for me to send them to his office soon, soonest! Before the day was over, they'd been returned, doublesealed, to my apartment. What had he expected? I'll never know, but the ritual was to be repeated by almost every publisher in New York. Let me quickly add that women editors as well as men hated the evidence of what women's sexual fantasies actually were.<br><br>This was not innocence on their part, merely their wish not to be told something they had silently always known: We women fantasize just like men, and the images are not always pretty. We know everything long before we are ready to know it, and so we cling to our denials.<br><br>As for the behavioral world, the dozens of psychologists and psychiatrists I interviewed informed me that I was on a deadend street. "Only men have sexual fantasies," they told me. As late as June 1973, the same month <i>My Secret Garden</i> was published, permissive <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine printed a cover story by the eminent and equally permissive Dr. Allan Fromme, stating, "Women do not have sexual fantasies....The reason for this is obvious: Women haven't been brought up to enjoy sex...women are by and large destitute of sexual fantasy."<br><br>Initially the women I interviewed bore out Fromme's prophecy. "What's a sexual fantasy?" they would ask, or, "What do you mean by suggesting I have sexual fantasies? I love my husband!" or, "Who needs fantasy? My real sex life is great." Even the most sexually active women I knew, who wanted to be part of the research, would strain to understand and then shake their heads.<br><br>Then I learned the power of permission that comes from other women's voices. Only when I told them my own fantasies did recognition dawn. No man, certainly not Dr. Fromme, could have persuaded these women to drop the veil from the preconscious -- that level of consciousness between the unconscious and full awareness -- and reveal the fantasy they had repeatedly enjoyed and then denied. Only women can liberate other women; only women's voices grant permission to be sexual, to be free to be anything we want, when enough of us tell one another it is okay.<br><br>Finally after three years of slow-going research -- one-on-one interviews, magazine articles inviting women to contribute, advertisements in everything from the <i>Village Voice</i> to the <i>London Times</i> (<i>New York</i> magazine was too virginal to run the ad) -- <i>My Secret Garden</i> was published in 1973. After publication there was a final salvo from the media accusing me of inventing the entire book, having made up all the fantasies. (The Cleveland <i>Plain Dealer</i> reviewed the book on its sports page, a last defensive hee-haw.)<br><br>But within months it seemed that women's erotic reveries had been with us always, so much so that advertisers were using fantasy as a selling tool before the year was over. Today women's magazines, films, books, television, automatically employ fantasy to explain and make real a woman's character. It is astonishing, when you think about it, how quickly women's fantasies have been incorporated into our universal understanding of woman.<br><br>Timing is everything. When there is an absolute need to know something, when an intellectual void must be filled, we will accept what only moments earlier we'd rejected for centuries. In 1973 a number of social and economic currents came together, forcing women to understand themselves and change their lives. Sexual identity was a vital missing link. The time was right to take the lid of repression off women's sexual fantasies.<br><br>Four years later it would be the identical story with <i>My Mother/My Self,</i> the book that grew immediately out of <i>My Secret Garden's</i> questioning of the source of women's terrible guilt about sex. Initially this later book was violently rejected by both publishers and readers. "I threw your book across the room!" "I wanted to kill you!" were typical reader's comments. But what followed was a snowballing acceptance as one woman told another to read this book that talked about the unmentionable: the mother/daughter relationship (another subject about which there was not a word in any of the libraries). If we were to change the repetitious pat...</p><h2>The Selected Journals of L. M. Montgomery: Vol. 1</h2><p>A bestseller in Canada, this book will fascinate the legions of devoted readers of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> and Montgomery's other Anne books.<br> Lucy Maud Montgomery (1874-1942) kept extensive journals for most of her life, beginning them in 1889 when she was fourteen and continuing them until shortly before her death. Spontaneous and frank, they are unusual for their narrative interest: Montgomery's gifts as a storyteller are as much in evidence here as in her novels. This first volume takes her to 1910, the year before her marriage, and culminates with the publication of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>.<br> The autobiographical content will intrigue every dedicated fan of the Anne books. But the Mongomery journals are especially interesting because they provide a unique social history and the privelege of viewing closely the life of a remarkable woman.<br><em>About the Author:</em><br>Mary Rubio is Literary Adviser to the Estate of L.M.

By associating the two Benedicts, it also suggests that their eras are alike, that the state of Europe indicated by the failure of the first pan-European constitution (withdrawn in 2005) to acknowledge Europe's Christian heritage is like that of the sixth century. In the first of the three lectures here, Ratzinger lays out the dangers of thoroughgoing official secularism and proposes to those outside the church that, regardless of their beliefs, they assume God exists--a form of Pascal's wager. The second explains why, regardless of secular laws, the church may not stop fighting abortion, euthanasia, and other challenges to the sanctity of each human life. The last expounds on the necessarily contingent and communal nature of faith. Each speech's close argument rewards careful attention and, though immediately addressed to Europe, applies to secular-spiritual clashes throughout the world. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Barn earned a starred review from School Library Journal and was named a School Library Journal Best Book of the Year in 1996. Pearl also received a starred review in Publishers Weekly. Ms. Atwell lives in Maine.Symbols of harvest, shelter, honest effort, and quintessential Americana, barns are the epitome of North American vernacular architecture. Barn , a loving tribute to these simple yet powerful structures, contains an informed text by practitioners of barn restoration who treat barns as historical, architectural, and cultural entities. Sections deal with European origins, New World barns, barn raising, and restoration. Some 200 evocative color photos, illuminating diagrams, and overall careful design will appeal to a wide range of readers on many levels. Endersby's Barn is highly recommended for academic and larger public collections. The Pennsylvania Barn focuses on a single type: the forebay bank, or Pennsylvania-German barn, evolved from 18th-century Swiss and German models, which has enriched agricultural landscapes across a broad region of the United States and Canada. Ensminger (geography, Kutztown Univ.) has written a scholarly inquiry of value to cultural and historical geographers, regional folklorists, and students of rural American architecture. The detailed text is enhanced by more than 40 maps and diagrams and 150 photos. This specialized study expands Joseph Glass's The Pennsylvania Culture Region: A View from the Barn (UMI Res. Pr., 1986). LeRoy Schultz's Barns, Stables, and Outbuildings (McFarland, 1986) provides a useful bibliography, and Ernest Burden's Living Barns (N.Y.

The world is poised for social and political change, but England holds tight to its traditions, classes, and prejudices.<br> &nbsp;<br> When an explosion in London kills two policemen and seriously injures three more, many believe that anarchists are the culprits. But Thomas Pitt, commander of Special Branch, knows the city&#x2019;s radical groups well enough to suspect that someone with decidedly more personal motives lit the deadly fuse. As he investigates the source of the fatal blast, Pitt is stunned to discover that the bombing was a calculated strike against the ranks of law enforcement.<br> &nbsp;<br> But still more shocking revelations await, as Pitt&#x2019;s inquiries lead him to a member of Parliament hoping for a lucrative business deal, a high-ranking police officer with secrets to keep, and an aristocratic opium addict seeking murderous revenge.

The fire brigade had thoroughly hosed the small bursts of flame here and there, and the water had puddled on the floor and settled into the craters left by the bomb that had detonated approximately forty-�five minutes ago. It was midday but the sky was still clouded with smoke and the stench of it was everywhere.<br><br>Pitt moved out of the way as two ambulance men lifted a wounded man onto a makeshift litter and carried him out to the waiting ambulance. The horses were shifting their weight impatiently. They knew the smell of burning in the early winter air and each crash of collapsing timber startled them, though they waited obediently.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it, sir,&#x201d; the white-�faced constable said to Pitt, blinking rapidly. Perhaps it was the smoke that stung the man&#x2019;s eyes, but more probably it was emotion. All of the men who had been caught in the explosion were police: five of them altogether. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the last of them out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; Pitt acknowledged the words. &#x201c;How many dead?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hobbs and Newman, sir. We didn&#x2019;t move the bodies.&#x201d; The constable coughed and tried to clear his throat. &#x201c;Ednam, Bossiney, and Yarcombe are pretty badly injured, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Pitt repeated. His mind was teeming with thoughts, and yet he could not come up with anything to say that would give any real comfort to the constable. Pitt was head of Special Branch, that discreet part of Security that dealt with threats to the nation&#x2014;�sabotage, assassinations, bombings, any form of terrorism. He had seen destruction and violent death more times than he cared to remember. In fact, before Special Branch he had been in the regular police, dealing primarily with cases of murder.<br><br>But this was a deliberate attack directed specifically at the police: colleagues he had known and worked with over the years. He could remember Newman getting married, Hobbs&#x2019;s first promotion. Now he had to search this wreckage for their bodies.<br><br>He turned and started to move slowly, picking his way so as not to disturb what was left of the situation&#x2014;�the evidence, if it could be called such. They already knew it was a bomb blast. Two people had been close enough to witness it. They had heard the explosion and seen the rubble flying, and then the flames as the wood caught fire. Now they were sitting in the back of an ambulance as one of the drivers finished binding up a gash in an arm caused by flying glass. There were shards everywhere from exploded windows. Both of the witnesses looked battered and shocked, but Pitt would have to interview them.<br><br>He spoke to the man first. He looked to be in his sixties, white-�haired, dressed in a formal coat. Likely he had been on his way back home from church. There were cuts on the right side of his face, and a burn across his cheek, as if a piece of flaming wood had caught him. His right side was smeared with dust and there were small burns in the fabric of his clothes.<br><br>&#x201c;On my way home from church, God help us,&#x201d; the man said shakily after Pitt had introduced himself and apologized for disturbing him. &#x201c;What kind of people would do this?&#x201d; He was frightened, and trying desperately not to show it in front of the woman. His wife, Pitt assumed. He must have been walking on the outside, as a man would, and she had been closer to the blast and was more seriously hurt. It was her arm the ambulance man was binding.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you see anyone else in the street?&#x201d; Pitt asked. &#x201c;Anyone at all? Any witnesses might help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No . . . no, I didn&#x2019;t. We were talking to each other,&#x201d; the man replied. &#x201c;Who would do this? What do they want?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, sir. But we&#x2019;ll find out,&#x201d; Pitt promised. The ambulance man caught Pitt&#x2019;s eye, his glance indicating that Pitt should hurry. Blood was already beginning to seep through the bandage on the woman&#x2019;s arm as he added another layer, and she looked pale.<br><br>Pitt handed his card to the man. He didn&#x2019;t see any point in delaying them further. &#x201c;Thank you. That&#x2019;s all for now. If you remember anything, please let us know.&#x201d; He wished them well, and with a nod to the ambulance man he walked back toward the house. It was time to go in and look at the bodies, gather whatever evidence there was.<br><br>He skirted around a block of fallen masonry, picking his way carefully. He could taste burning in the air, and yet it was cold.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir!&#x201d; a fireman called out. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t come in here! It&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt kept on walking, his feet crunching on broken glass. &#x201c;Commander Pitt,&#x201d; he introduced himself.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh . . . well, watch where you put your feet, sir. And your head.&#x201d; He glanced upward at a broken beam that was hanging at a crazy angle, swaying a little, as if it could become detached and fall off any moment. &#x201c;You still shouldn&#x2019;t ought to be here,&#x201d; he added.<br><br>&#x201c;The dead men?&#x201d; Pitt requested.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s dangerous in here,&#x201d; the man pointed out. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll not be going nowhere, sir. Best you let us get them out. The blast killed them, sir. No doubt about that.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt would have liked the excuse not to look at the bodies, but there was none. He might learn nothing useful, but it would be a beginning of facing the reality and coming to terms with it.<br><br>He was standing in front of the fireman. The man was pale-�faced, apart from the black ash smudges on his cheeks. His uniform was filthy, and wet. When he had time to think about it, he would realize he was cold as well.<br><br>&#x201c;The bodies?&#x201d; Pitt nudged him as gently as he could.<br><br>&#x201c;That way, sir,&#x201d; the man said reluctantly. &#x201c;But be careful. You&#x2019;d be best not to touch anything. Bring the whole lot down on top o&#x2019; yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Pitt responded, beginning the awkward journey, trying to avoid tripping. If he fell he would almost certainly bang into a jutting wall strut, a piece of smashed furniture, or something dangling from where the ceiling used to be.<br><br>The floorboards were half up, torn by the blast. It must have been a large bomb and, to judge by the burning and the angles of the broken wood, he was near the center of it. What on earth had happened here in the quiet house on a pleasant London street near Kensington Gardens? Anarchists? London was full of them. Half the revolutionaries in Europe had either lived here or passed through. In this year of 1898 there had been less terrorist activity than in the recent past, but now, almost at the close of the year, it seemed Special Branch&#x2019;s sense of ease was misplaced. Was this the dying blow, or the first outrider of another storm? Nihilists in Europe had assassinated President Carnot of France, Tsar Alexander II of Russia, the Spanish prime minister, C�novas del Castillo, and, earlier this year, the empress Elisabeth of Austria-�Hungary. Perhaps the violence was now coming here to England as well?<br><br>In front of Pitt there was a body, or what was left of it. Suddenly he could not swallow, and he thought for a moment that he was going to be sick. One leg was entirely gone, one side of the chest caved in under part of a beam from the rafters. But the man&#x2019;s face was oddly unmarked. Pitt could recognize Newman.<br><br>He would have to go and see Newman&#x2019;s widow, say all the usual words of grief. It would not help, but its omission would hurt.<br><br>He stared at the body. Did it tell him anything, other than what the fireman had already said? There was no smoke on Newman&#x2019;s face. His left arm was mostly gone, but when Pitt looked more closely he saw his right hand was clean. Did that mean he was already inside here when the bomb went off? He had not battled his way through smoke and rubble. Why had he come here? Trouble reported? An alarm of some sort? Following someone? A meeting already arranged? An ambush?<br><br>He turned and moved away, dizzy for a moment. He took a deep breath, steadied himself, and pressed on.<br><br>The second body was half-�obscured by fallen plaster and wood, but it was far less obviously damaged. There was little smoke or dust on Hobbs&#x2019;s face and his pattern of freckles was easily recognizable. Pitt studied him as dispassionately as he could, trying to learn something from the way the debris lay around him. The police surgeon would be able to tell him more, but it appeared that Hobbs had been caught by surprise, and much further from the site of the explosion than Newman.<br><br>Pitt was still staring at the surroundings when he heard footsteps somewhere behind him. He turned and saw the familiar figure of Samuel Tellman picking his way through the plaster, water, and charred wood. Tellman had been Pitt&#x2019;s sergeant when they were both at Bow Street. It had taken them a long time to be comfortable with each other. Tellman had distrusted anyone with a background as humble as Pitt&#x2019;s but who spoke like a gentleman. To him it seemed that Pitt&#x2019;s accent was affected, as if Pitt thought himself superior. Pitt felt no reason to explain that his speech was the product of having been educated along with Sir Arthur Desmond&#x2019;s son at the country estate where his father had been gamekeeper. When his father had been transported to Australia for a crime he had not committed, Pitt&#x2019;s mother had remained as laundress, and Sir Arthur had seen the young Pitt as a companion to his son and a spur to excel him in class. The whole story was a wound that still ached on his father&#x2019;s behalf, and it wasn&#x2019;t something he wished to discuss with Tellman. But years of working together had taught them a mutual respect, and loyalty.<br><br>&#x201c;Good afternoon, sir.&#x201d; Tellman stopped beside him.<br><br>&#x201c;Good afternoon, Inspector,&#x201d; Pitt replied.<br><br>Tellman stared down at the body. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m your liaison with the police, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt had expected someone to provide liaison, partly because he was Special Branch and not in the regular police, but mostly because the victims were the police&#x2019;s own men. The internal loyalty of the police force was not unlike that of soldiers in an army at war. An officer facing danger had to have an absolute trust in those who stood beside him, or at his back.<br><br>Pitt nodded. It would be good to work with Tellman again&#x2014;�but he wished it were on anything other than this.<br><br>&#x201c;Looks like they were right here when it went off,&#x201d; Pitt observed. &#x201c;Newman must have been closest to it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. I saw. What kind of a bloody lunatic would do this?&#x201d; Tellman&#x2019;s voice was tight, as if he were controlling it with difficulty. &#x201c;I want freedom for all men, and food, and houses, and the right to come and go as I please. But what the hell good does something like this do? Which anarchists did this, anyway? Spanish? Italian? French? Russian? Why in God&#x2019;s name do all the bloody lunatics in Europe come and live in London?&#x201d; He turned to face Pitt. &#x201c;Why do we let them?&#x201d; His face was white, two spots of color in his lean cheeks, anger in his eyes. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know who they are? Isn&#x2019;t that what Special Branch is supposed to be for, to prevent exactly this from happening?&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt hunched his shoulders and drove his hands deeper into his pockets. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t make the policy, Tellman. And yes, I know who a lot of them are. Mostly they just talk.&#x201d;<br><br>The disgust and the pain in Tellman&#x2019;s face were more powerful than words. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll find them and hang them&#x2014;�whatever you want to do about it.&#x201d; It was a challenge.<br><br>Pitt did not bother to answer. He understood the emotion behind the words. Right at this moment he felt much the same. He might feel differently when he learned who was responsible. Some of the men branded as anarchists had done no more than protest for decent pay, enough to feed their families. A few of them had been imprisoned, tortured, and even executed, simply for protesting against injustice. Driven far enough, he might have done the same.<br><br>&#x201c;Why were these men here?&#x201d; he asked Tellman. &#x201c;Five of them, at this quiet house right on the park? It can&#x2019;t have been an inquiry. You don&#x2019;t need five men for that. There&#x2019;s no one else dead or hurt, so the house must have been empty. What were they doing?&#x201d;<br><br>Tellman&#x2019;s expression tightened. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know yet, but I mean to find out. But if the investigation was to do with anarchists, they would have told Special Branch what was going on. So it must be something else.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt did not take that totally for granted as Tellman seemed to, but it was not the time to argue. &#x201c;Anything known about this address?&#x201d; he asked instead.<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d; Tellman looked around him. &#x201c;What about the bomb? Bombs are your business. What was it made of? Where was it put? How did they let it off?&#x201d;</p><h2>Charleston Grill at Charleston Place: French Influenced Lowcountry Cuisine</h2><p><p>Fusing South Carolina lowcountry cooking and his own French-influenced technique, Chef Bob Waggoner creates contemporary and sophisticated new Southern haute cuisine at his award-winning Charleston Grill using seasonal, locally sourced ingredients.

[Boraan strikes Dagler with candlestick] [Exit Dagler, holding his head] &#x2014;Miersen, Six Parts Water Day One, Act IV, Scene 4 The transition from mountain to forest was so gradual, I wasn&#x2019;t entirely sure I was out of the mountains for a while even after I had turned north; and this in spite of them towering over me to my left. But eventually, I became convinced that I wasn&#x2019;t getting much lower, and soon enough, there was no question that I was in deep woods, with trees I can&#x2019;t name so close together I sometimes had to squeeze past them and with branches so low I had to duck to avoid getting hit in the face. The combination seemed unfair. After that I felt more confident as I headed north, giving thanks for the occasional clearing, even though in the clearings I could see the Furnace, and it hurt my eyes. I don&#x2019;t like forests. I hate the trees, and I hate the bushes, and I&#x2019;m not even that fond of the paths, because they have a way of either suddenly heading off in directions you don&#x2019;t want to go, or just stopping without giving you any explanation for their conduct. When I was running my territory for the Jhereg, if any of my people had acted like that I&#x2019;d have had their legs broken. In the Pushta, you can usually see a good distance around you; you just have to keep an eye on what might be moving through the grasses. In the mountain, at least the mountains I&#x2019;ve been on, you can see for miles in at least a couple of directions. In the city, you might not be able to see very far, but you can identify where anyone who might want to do you harm could be lurking. Forests are thick, and anything can come from anywhere; I never feel safe. And sleeping is the worst. I spent about three nights in the forest after I came down from the mountains, and I didn&#x2019;t get a good night&#x2019;s sleep the entire time, in spite of the fact that Loiosh and Rocza were watching for me. I just couldn&#x2019;t relax. When I become ruler of the world, I&#x2019;m going to have inns put up along every little road and trail in that place. I would certainly have gotten lost if it weren&#x2019;t for Loiosh and an occasional sight of the mountain. I waded over several brooks and streams, one of which showed signs of becoming a river soon: it seemed to be in a terrible hurry, and had a lot of force for being only a foot or so deep and maybe ten feet wide. I didn&#x2019;t much care for that, either. In spite of the annoyances, I was never in any danger so far as I know (though I&#x2019;m told Dzur sometimes hunt the forests). I made it through; leave it at that. The trees became lower, sparser, and the grass taller, with large, jagged boulders intruding on the landscape as if the mountain were encroaching. "Well, for marching blind, I guess we did all right, Loiosh." "We sure did, Boss. And only modesty forbids me from saying how we managed." "Heh." An hour or so later we found a road. A real road. I could have danced, if I could dance. It was getting on toward evening, and the Furnace was sinking behind the mountains. The shadows&#x2014; remarkably sharp, looking almost tangible&#x2014;were long, and a certain chill was coming into the air on a breeze from behind me. "That way," said my familiar, indicating down the road to the right. Since the mountains were to the left, I&#x2019;d have figured that one out on my own, but I didn&#x2019;t say anything. I set out. After mountain and forest, it was a positive luxury to walk on a road; even a rutted, gouged, untended road like this. My feet thanked me, as did my left elbow, which was no longer being cracked by my sword&#x2019;s pommel when I raised my left leg to climb onto a rock. For an hour or so, I saw no one and nothing save a lone farmhouse far across a field. The shadows lengthened and Loiosh was silent and my mind wandered. I thought about Cawti, of course. A few weeks ago, I&#x2019;d been married. A few weeks before that, happily married; or at least I thought so. Anyone can make a mistake. But what was odd was how little I was feeling it. It was pleasant walking down the road, and I was in good shape from all the climbing, and the evening wasn&#x2019;t too cold. I knew the whole thing was going to hit me&#x2014;I mean, I knew it. It was like seeing an out-of-control team barreling down on you, and watching it come closer, and knowing it&#x2019;s going to flatten you. Here it comes, yep, I&#x2019;m about to be either killed or messed up. Any second now. How interesting. I could even be sort of dispassionate about it. I pondered whether I could convince her to take me back, and, if so, how? I ran through the arguments in my head, and they seemed very persuasive. I suspected they&#x2019;d be less so when I actually tried them on her. And, even if she was convinced, I&#x2019;d still have to deal with her politics, which is what had gotten between us in the first place. And there was still the big problem, which was that circumstances had conspired to force me to save her. I don&#x2019;t know if I could have forgiven her if she had saved me; I didn&#x2019;t see how she could forgive me for saving her. It&#x2019;s an ugly burden. Eventually, I was going to have to try to overcome it. And in the meantime, I was heading in the opposite direction, while somewhere behind there were people who wanted to get rich by putting the shine on me. No, it didn&#x2019;t look good. How interesting. "We getting close to the water, Loiosh?" "Wind shifted, Boss. I don&#x2019;t know." "All right." I should mention that nothing so far was at all familiar from my previous journey to Fenario, but that had been years before, and I wasn&#x2019;t paying all that much attention to my surroundings then. With an abruptness that caught me by surprise, it was dark&#x2014;I mean completely dark. There were small pinpoints of light in the sky, but they provided no illumination. Maybe they should have; I was told by a human physicker once that I had poor night vision. I could have had it corrected, but the process is painful, and a spell to compensate is absurdly easy. Except, of course, when you are unable to cast the simplest of spells for fear of removing the protections that keep the bad guys from finding you. So for now, little points of light or no, I was effectively blind. I wondered if failing to have that fixed when I could would end up being what did me in. Come to think of it, I still wonder. I stepped a few paces off the road, and, having no better idea, took off my pack, spread out my blanket, and lay down. Loiosh and Rocza, I knew, would take care of any annoying beasts, and wake me if there were any dangerous ones. It wasn&#x2019;t until I was prone that I became aware of the sound of night insects all around me. I wondered if they were the sort that bit; then sleep took me. Evidently they weren&#x2019;t the sort that bit. I&#x2019;d been walking about two hours the next day before I passed a young man driving a wagon filled with hay. I hailed him, and he stopped the horse&#x2014;one of the biggest I&#x2019;d ever seen&#x2014;and greeted me. I had the impression he was a bit disconcerted by the jhereg on my shoulders, but was too polite to say anything. "Which way to Burz?" I asked him. He pointed the way I was going. "Over the bridge," he said, "in a while the road will fork, and there&#x2019;s a sign. You&#x2019;ll likely smell it after that." "Good enough," I told him, and gave him a couple of copper pennies. He tapped his forehead, which I took as a gesture of thanks, and continued on his way. I suddenly felt as if I was too relaxed, not paying enough attention, and resolved to stay a little more on my guard. Then it hit me that I had now made that resolution around a dozen times since coming down out of the mountains. "I&#x2019;m feeling safe, Loiosh. As if I&#x2019;m out of danger. I can&#x2019;t decide if I should trust that feeling." "I&#x2019;m not sure, Boss, but I&#x2019;ve been feeling the same way." "Like we&#x2019;re out of their reach?" "Yeah." "Well, we probably are, but let&#x2019;s not trust it too much." I found the bridge&#x2014;it spanned a stream maybe twenty feet wide&#x2014;and went "a while," which turned out to be most of the rest of the day. Once over the bridge, the road abruptly improved, showing signs of regular maintenance. I stopped a couple of times to eat bread, cheese, and sausage I&#x2019;d gotten in Saestara (the village, not the mountain). The bread was getting stale, but it was still better than the hardtack. As I walked, I noticed that the forest, which I had thought was left behind me, seemed to be returning on my right; or maybe it was a different forest. I ought to have tried to find a map, I suppose, but I&#x2019;m told they are hard to come by and rarely reliable. Over the next several hours, the forest seemed to come closer, but avoided the road (I know, the road was dug around the forest, but I&#x2019;m telling you how it looked, all right?). Eventually, I found the fork, and there was a sign just as there was supposed to be, on a stout wooden pole. I followed it, and the road bent closer to the forest. It took us over low hills, and in places there were crops I didn&#x2019;t recognize in neat rows. More farmhouses appeared. The outbuildings were in good shape, and well painted. I tried not to look down on the locals for building everything out of wood; I knew that just came from living among Dragaerans. From an unbiased viewpoint, this seemed to be a more prosperous area than similar regions near Adrilankha. I wondered what Cawti would say if I made that observation to her. The shadows lengthened, as the Furnace prepared to vanish behind the mountains, still looming up behind me. Presently, I became aware of a low rumble to my right, and I saw that the road had been joined by a fairly respectable river. The Furnace plunged below the mountains, and it became significantly darker; still somewhat lit by the glow behind me, but&#x2014;I was going to have to get used to how much more quickly it became dark, and how very much darker it was here. It had never occurred to me that the permanent overcast above the Empire might somehow provide a bit o...</p></p><h2>Slinky Malinki</h2><p>From the creator of Hairy Maclary comes a new series starring a rascally cat named Slinky Malinki. &#x201c;What was he up to?

Just for self defense,&#x201d; King assured him. It was not the only weapon King kept for such a purpose; one of his advisors remembered the reverend's Montgomery, Alabama home as an arsenal.&#x201d;<br><br>Like King, many ostensibly nonviolent&#x201d; civil rights activists embraced their constitutional right to selfprotection yet this crucial dimension of the Afro-American freedom struggle has been long ignored by history. In <i>This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed</i>, civil rights scholar Charles E. Cobb Jr. describes the vital role that armed self-defense played in the survival and liberation of black communities in America during the Southern Freedom Movement of the 1960s. In the Deep South, blacks often safeguarded themselves and their loved ones from white supremacist violence by bearing and, when necessary, using firearms. In much the same way, Cobb shows, nonviolent civil rights workers received critical support from black gun owners in the regions where they worked. Whether patrolling their neighborhoods, garrisoning their homes, or firing back at attackers, these courageous men and women and the weapons they carried were crucial to the movement's success.<br><br>Giving voice to the World War II veterans, rural activists, volunteer security guards, and self-defense groups who took up arms to defend their lives and liberties, <i>This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed</i> lays bare the paradoxical relationship between the nonviolent civil rights struggle and the Second Amendment. Drawing on his firsthand experiences in the civil rights movement and interviews with fellow participants, Cobb provides a controversial examination of the crucial place of firearms in the fight for American freedom.</p><p><b>Charles E.

Cobb lives in Jacksonville, Florida.<i>This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed</i> jostles us outside the ho-hum frame of pick up a gun' vs. turn the other cheek.' Charles Cobb's graceful prose and electrifying history throw down a gauntlet: can we understand any part of the Freedom Struggle apart from America's unique romanticization of violence and gun culture? This absorbing investigation shows how guns are often necessary, but not sufficient, to live out political democracy.&#x201d;<br><b> Wesley Hogan, Director, Center for Documentary Studies, Duke University</b><br><br><b>A 2015 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award nominee</b><br><br> [A] richly detailed memoir...&#x201d;<br><b> <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br> Terrific&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Denver Post</i></b><br><br> Cobb's long-essay format brings the Freedom Movement to life in an unexpected way, shaking up conventional historical views and changing the conversation about individual freedom and personal protection that continues today A nuanced exploration of the complex relationship between nonviolent civil disobedience and the threat of armed retaliation.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Shelf Awareness for Readers</i></b><br><br> [A] revelatory new history of armed self-defense and the civil rights movement...&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Reason</i></b><br><br> Masterfully told [A] challenging and important new narrative...&#x201d;<br><b> The Root</b><br><br> [A] brilliant book A serious analytical work of the African-American southern Freedom Struggle, Cobb's book...deserves a prominent place on everyone's reading list.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Against the Current</i></b><br><br> This is an important and mind-opening book of recent American history and social change that is still evolving.

Charles Cobb works mightily against that torrent. <i>This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed</i> shows that the simplistic popular understanding of the black freedom movement obscures a far richer story. Cobb defies the popular narrative with accounts of the grit and courage of armed stalwarts of the modern movement who invoked the ancient right of self-defense under circumstances where we should expect nothing less. This book is an important contribution to a story that is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.&#x201d;<br><b> Nicholas Johnson, Professor of Law, Fordham Law School, and author of <i>Negroes and the Gun: The Black Tradition of Arms</i></b><br><br> Powerfully and with great depth, Charles Cobb examines the organizing tradition of the southern Freedom Movement, drawing on both his own experiences as a field secretary with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) working in the rural black belt South and contemporary conversations with his former co-workers. While Cobb challenges the orthodox narrative of the nonviolent' movement, this is much more than a book about guns. It is essential reading.&#x201d;<br><b> Julian Bond, NAACP Chairman Emeritus</b><br><br> Blending compelling experience with first-rate scholarship, Charles E. Cobb Jr. traces the way that armed self-defense and nonviolent direct action worked sometimes in tension but mostly in tandem in the African American freedom struggle. Crafted with powerful clarity and engaging prose, Cobb's book deploys the intellectual insights of both everyday people and excellent historians to make the case that it wasn't necessarily non-nonviolent' to pack a pistol or tote a shotgun in the civil rights-era South but grassroots activists often found it necessary. This is easily the best, most accessible, and most comprehensive book on the subject.&#x201d;<br><b> Timothy B. Tyson, author of <i>Radio Free Dixie: Robert F.

Understanding how the use of guns makes this history of the civil rights movement more compelling to readers, Cobb is nonetheless focused on the determination of ordinary citizens, women included, to win their rights, even if that meant packing a pistol in a pocket or purse.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</b><br><br> Persuasive.... Cobb's bracing and engrossing celebration of black armed resistance ties together two of founding principles of the Republic individual equality and the right to arm oneself against tyranny and the hypocrisy and ambiguity evident still in their imbalanced application.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br> Charles Cobb, Jr.'s <i>This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed</i> is a marvelous contribution to our understanding the modern Black Freedom Struggle. With wonderful storytelling skills and drawing on his unparalleled access to movement particpants, he situates armed self-defense in the context of a complex movement and in conversation with both nonviolence and community organizing. Cobb writes from personal experience on the frontlines of SNCC's voter registration work while also using the skills of journalist, historian, and teacher. The result is a compelling and wonderfully nuanced book that will appeal to specialists and, more importantly, anyone interested in human rights and the freedom struggle.&#x201d;<br><b> Emilye Crosby, author of <i>A Little Taste of Freedom: The Black Freedom Struggle in Claiborne County, Mississippi</i> and editor of <i>Civil Rights History from the Ground Up</i></b><br><br> This long overdue book revises the image of black people in the South as docile and frightened.

Or so Charles Cobb says in this passionate, intellectually disciplined reordering of the conventional narrative to include armed self-defense as a central component of the black movement's success. Read it and be reminded that history is not a record etched in stone by journalists and academics, but a living stream, fed and redirected by the bottom-up witness of its participants.&#x201d;<br><b> Hodding Carter III, Professor of Public Policy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</b><br><br> <i>This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed</i> is the most important movement book in many years. Charles Cobb uses long-standing confusion over the distinction between violence and nonviolence as an entr�e to rethinking many fundamental misconceptions about what the civil rights movement was and why it was so powerful. This level of nuance requires a disciplined observer, an engaged participant, and a lyrical writer. Cobb is all these.&#x201d;<br><b> Charles M. Payne, author of <i>I've Got the Light of Freedom: The Organizing Tradition and the Mississippi Freedom Struggle</i></b><br><br> <i>This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed</i> is a powerful mixture of history and memoir, a scholarly and emotionally engaging account of a dark time in our recent history.

Worst yet is the fact that what we think we know is just plain wrong. Politicians and special interest groups benefit from this ignorance while the American people slip deeper into debt and financial slavery. Biblical Economics tells you exactly what, how and why you need to know about its topic, no more and no less. With a passing interest in the subject, you may know a few more things about economics than R.C. chooses to discuss in the book. But most of those things are not things that most of us need to know in order to live a biblically sound life. Only a few are vital, and R.C. has done us the immense favor of isolating them, explaining them in clear and simple terms, and showing how they are pertinent and in fact critical to an understanding of how Christians must live in a world that is adamant about denying the role of God in providing our daily bread. You&#39;ll find that Biblical Economics is an invaluable aid for developing your own understanding of economic principles. Read it, then give it your child to read and then talk with him about it.</p><p>Robert Craig Sproul, better known as R.C. Sproul, Jr., is a Calvinist Christian minister and theologian and is the son of Robert Charles Sproul, a noted Reformed theologian and founder of Ligonier Ministries. Sproul, Jr. holds degrees from Grove City College and Reformed Theological Seminary and received his D.Min. from Whitefield Theological Seminary. He is a teaching elder of Saint Peter Presbyterian Church (SPPC) and is founder, chairman, and teacher of the Highlands Study Center (HSC), both in the Bristol, Virginia area. At HSC, Sproul teaches a Bible study for the community and classes for homeschooled students, guides HSC&#39;s resident students through their independent studies, and serves as executive editor of Every Thought Captive, a bimonthly magazine published by HSC. He has spoken at a number of conferences and is a vocal supporter of homeschooling, traditional family roles, and limited government.During any discussion of economics and politics from a biblical perspective, one will inevitably hear the oft-repeated statement, The Bible is not an economics textbook. No serious economist or theologian would deny this, but its implications are dangerous. The philosophical, moral, and ethical side of economics can easily be overlooked... Economics in theory and in practice touches heavily on, and at times rudely collides with, biblical ethics. Where ethics touches economics, the Bible is relevant. --R.C. Sproul, Sr.<br><br>Biblical Economics is actually the third incarnation of this book. It first appeared in 1985 under the title Money Matters, its author a prodigious twenty years old. Nine years later, as the economy became a topic of obsessive concern among Americans, the book was reprinted as Dollar Signs of the Times. In 2002 it was published by the Highlands Study center as Biblical Economics and in 2008 released again by Tolle Lege Press. --Tolle Lege Press</p><h2>Prayer: The Art of Believing</h2><p>An unabridged edition, to include: Law of Reversibility - Dual Nature of Consciousness - Imagination &amp; Faith - Controlled Reverie - Good Tidings - Law of Thought Transmission - The Greatest Prayer</p><p></p><h2>The Gospel of John, Volume 1 (The Daily Study Bible Series, Revised Edition)</h2><p>In Vol. 1 of The Gospel of John, the great Scottish Bible interpreter William Barclay follows the formula of the Daily Study Bible Series by first giving the text for the day&#39;s study in his own translation, followed by two or three pages of commentary.</p><p>Text: English (translation)</p><h2>Mansfield Park</h2><p>The story of a timid young girl from a poor family who is raised by her rich aunt and uncle at Mansfield Park.

Adopting the wide-ranging approach familiar to readers of his previous books on the artist, author James Russell explores the evolution of a remarkable talent. </p><p>An introductory section offers an intimate portrait of Ravilious, an artist for whom personal relationships, particularly with women, were paramount.

A passionate advocate of twentieth-century British painting and design, he writes and lectures widely.

Let them ferment, and you've got a charming look inside the operations at Don and Jesse Lange's winery. An abundance of words (witness the book's subtitle), run-on sentences, rhyming, alliteration and stylized dialogue all contribute to a bacchanalian use of language that reflects <i>Portland </i>magazine editor Doyle's joyful view on both life and wine. With the author's bubbly sense of humor and sharp storytelling, dry facts become delightful tidbits. His descriptio of the grape vines' pollination process, for instance, bursts with sexual metaphors: "the wild seething scene in the vineyard, the vines fertilizing each other madly when no one is looking, the little tiny bras, the little tiny cigarettes, the recriminations at dawn." Like the wine Doyle writes of, these recollections are layered with subtlety and depth. Doyle ranges from discussing the basic pleasures of food, drink and conversation to ruminating on spiritual concepts. Perfect for wine aficionados and word lovers, this is a full-bodied, ebullient account. <i>(May 30)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Here, a leading American anthropologist has analyzed the many qays in which people "talk" to one another without the use of words.&nbsp;<br><br>The pecking order in a chicken yard, the fierce competition in a school playground, every unwitting gesture and action&#x2014;this is the vocabulary of the "silent language." According to Dr. Hall, the concepts of <i>space</i>&nbsp;and <i>time</i>&nbsp;are tools with which all human beings may transmit messages. <i>Space</i>, for example, is the outgrowth of an animal's instinctive defense of his lair and is reflected in human society by the office worker's jealous defense of his desk, or the guarded, walled patio of a Latin-American home. Similarly, the concept of <i>time</i>, varying from Western precision to Easter vagueness, is revealed by the businessman who pointedly keeps a client waiting, or the South Pacific islander who murders his neighbor for an injustice suffered twenty years ago.<br><br>"THE SILENT LANGUAGE shows how cultural factors influence the individual behind his back, wihtout his knowledge."&nbsp;&#x2014;Erich Fromm</p><p>Leading anthropologist Hall analyzes the many aspects of non-verbal communication and considers the concepts of space and time as tools for transmission of messages. His stimulating work is of interest to both the intelligent general reader and the sophisticated social scientist.Edward T. Hall was a widely traveled anthropologist whose fieldwork took him all over the world&#x2014;from the Pueblo cultures of the American Southwest to Europe and the Middle East. As director of the State Department&#x2019;s Point Four Training Program in the 1950s, Dr. Hall&#x2019;s mission was to teach foreign-bound technicians and administrators how to communicate effectively across cultural boundaries. He was a consultant to architects on human factors in design and to business and government agencies in the field of intercultural relations, and had taught at the University of Denver, Bennington College, the Washington School of Psychiatry, the Harvard Business School, the Illinois Institute of Technology, and Northwestern University. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Hall was born in Webster Groves, Missouri.

The tales are recalled in a conversational, feverish tone, following the musician in his childhood and young adulthood in post-World War II suburbia, pausing along the way for moments of clarity and introspection. The stories resist categorization&#x2014;part memoir, part personal essay, part fiction, and part manifesto they simply stand alone, having their own logic, religious dogma, and mythological history.</p></p><p>The truth, Winston Churchill once stated, must be accompanied by a bodyguard of lies. Guitarist John Fahey, whose folk-informed work has inspired musicians as dissimilar as George Winston and Jim O'Rourke, adheres to that principle throughout this conversationally voiced collection of ostensibly fictitious but semiautobiographical short stories. Fahey is no stranger to the written word: in the 1960s he published a volume on blues guitarist Charley Patton, and his albums have frequently included voluminous, fanciful liner notes. Fans looking for illumination of his guitar playing might be disappointed by this book: he spends more time spinning tall tales about a periodically horrific post-WWII suburban childhood and the many remarkable people he's met (from compassionate blues musician and fishing enthusiast Bukka White to pompous Italian film director Michelangelo Antonioni, whom Fahey claims to have punched out) than he does discussing his musical methodology. But his writing flickers with the same black humor and ambivalent mysticism that imbues his music. <i>--Bill Meyer</i><p><strong>John Fahey pioneered the steel-string acoustic guitar as a solo instrument and was a highly influential fingerstyle guitarist, serving as a model for guitarists ranging from Leo Kottke to Thurston Moore. He recorded more than 30 albums over the course of his lifetime and ranked 35th on <i>Rolling Stone</i>&#x2019;s list of &#x201c;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.&#x201d;</strong></p></p><h2>Rotherham&#39;s Emphasized Bible</h2><p>(Double-column pages; foreword by John R.

Poltergeists have a place in a healthy spectral ecosystem. They wouldn&#x2019;t exist if they didn&#x2019;t. Everything evolves for a reason, even the different sorts of ghost people become after they die. Nothing in this or any other dimension is inherently evil.<br><br>And none of that was really a comfort with the ghost of an eleven-year-old boy doing his level best to drop an entire house on my head.<br><br>&#x201c;Tyler! I&#x2019;m here to<i> help</i> you!&#x201d; I shouted, ducking around the nearest corner. A waterlogged dresser flew past overhead, shattering when it hit an exposed support beam. Either it had been full of beetles&#x2014;eww&#x2014;or Tyler was somehow creating them. When the dresser gave way, the bugs came flowing out, so plentiful that it seemed impossible they could have fit inside there. I squeaked and plastered myself against the wall, trying not to hyperventilate. I don&#x2019;t have a specific problem with bugs, but there&#x2019;s a big difference between seeing a single beetle and having a wave of them flowing toward your feet.<br><br>Mary sighed, stepping in front of me and drawing an arc across the floor with her toe. The beetles parted as they ran up against it, running in either direction, never crossing the line. After they had gone about three feet, they popped, becoming clouds of green mist that rose into the air and dissipated.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, this is officially the grossest ghostbusting job I have ever been on,&#x201d; I said, as calmly as I could. It wasn&#x2019;t all that calm. &#x201c;Where the hell is Artie?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can check, but it means leaving you alone with Tyler,&#x201d; cautioned Mary.

A microwave flew through the doorway and slammed into the wall next to the dresser. Unlike the dresser, it didn&#x2019;t burst into spectral cockroaches or break into a pile of splinters. Also, it could have crushed my skull, which I am fond of leaving uncrushed. I swallowed a yelp and moved farther down the hall, trying to keep my exits in view. With the way this had been going so far, I was going to need to run again before much longer.<br><br>The trouble with going up against ghosts is that most of them aren&#x2019;t bad, just confused. They don&#x2019;t get why I&#x2019;m alive and they&#x2019;re not. Sometimes that&#x2019;s a fair question, like with Tyler, who died when he was eleven. He&#x2019;d been riding his bike, following all the rules of the road&#x2014;even wearing a helmet&#x2014;when a drunk driver blasted around a corner and slammed into him, not giving him a chance to swerve. If there was any mercy in the situation, it was that Tyler had died instantly.<br><br>But maybe that wasn&#x2019;t actually merciful. Because he&#x2019;d died instantly, he hadn&#x2019;t had any time to process what was happening. One moment he was there. The next moment he was gone. The moment after <i>that</i>, he was back, spectral, confused, and coming home to haunt his family. They&#x2019;d only lasted six months before they moved away; who could live in a house that shook and groaned and sometimes cried in the voice of your dead son in the middle of the night?<br><br>That all happened four years ago. Tyler had been alone ever since, growing stronger, angrier, and more confused. It was a terrible situation for a kid to be in, alive or dead.<br><br>I would have had a lot more sympathy if he hadn&#x2019;t insisted on throwing things at my head, but hey. Nobody&#x2019;s perfect.<br><br>&#x201c;Tyler, dammit, could you calm <i>down</i>?&#x201d; I stayed pressed against the wall, hoping that by shouting at the kid without giving him an immediate target, I could get him to chill out&#x2014;or at least to stop throwing things. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not here to hurt you!&#x201d;<br><br>The air in front of me shimmered, and a spectral preteen boy appeared. He looked more like a ghost than either of our family phantoms: Rose and Mary both tended to manifest as fairly normal-looking teenage girls. Sure, Mary had white hair and terrifying babysitter eyes that could make me confess to damn near anything, but fashion hair dyes and cosplay contacts exist. You know what <i>doesn&#x2019;t</i> exist? Makeup that can make a living person transparent and faintly blue, that&#x2019;s what. Tyler looked like a really good CGI effect, the sort of thing I had exactly zero interest in getting up close and personal with.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Liar</i>,&#x201d; he hissed. &#x201c;Exorcist. <i>Liar</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If I were an exorcist, would I have a ghost with me?&#x201d; It seemed like a reasonable question.<br><br>Apparently not. Tyler scowled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re trying to <i>trick</i> me,&#x201d; he accused. Behind him&#x2014;well, technically, through him&#x2014;I saw the busted remains of the dresser start to pull themselves together. He was getting ready for another volley.<br><br>Swell. That was just what I needed. &#x201c;I am not trying to trick you, Tyler,&#x201d; I said firmly. &#x201c;If I were trying to trick you, I&#x2019;d have brought . . . shit, I don&#x2019;t even know. I have no idea how to trick a kid your age. I don&#x2019;t even like kids. I never have.&#x201d;<br><br>He blinked. I had apparently gone far enough off-script to confuse him. &#x201c;You were a kid once.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And when I was a kid, I was not my own biggest fan,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Kids are sticky by default, and annoying almost all the damn time. I am not the person you choose to trick a kid. Look, I&#x2019;m running out of novel ways to say this, but I&#x2019;m here because I want to help you. That starts with you helping me. You help me by not throwing that damn dresser at my head again. I am mortal, I am breakable, I do not want to be broken.&#x201d;<br><br>Tyler scowled. &#x201c;If you want to help me, where are my parents?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re gone. You died and they moved away, because they couldn&#x2019;t handle the pain of living here and knowing you weren&#x2019;t ever going to grow up, or come back, or be their little boy again.&#x201d; They&#x2019;d also moved away because he&#x2019;d scared the pants off them when he started haunting the place, but saying that seemed a little impolitic. Tyler had just been doing what his new instincts told him to do. It wasn&#x2019;t his fault that those instincts sort of sucked.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re <i>lying</i>!&#x201d; he howled, face distorting until it was less that of a preteen boy and more that of an unspeakable nightmare. I prepared to brace for impact.<br><br>Artie burst in through the front door and thrust a rectangular object at Tyler.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said, panting slightly. &#x201c;You wanna play RoboRally?&#x201d;<br><br>The nightmare bled back out of Tyler&#x2019;s face, replaced by an expression of deep, profound confusion. I could sort of understand where he was coming from. This wasn&#x2019;t exactly normal procedure.<br><br>I put a hand over my face and groaned. &#x201c;I asked for backup, not a comedy routine, Artie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This <i>is</i> backup,&#x201d; he said, sounding stung. &#x201c;I was an eleven-year-old boy and you weren&#x2019;t, and I&#x2019;m telling you, this is backup. C&#x2019;mon, Tyler. When&#x2019;s the last time you sat down and played a game?&#x201d;<br><br>My cousin is an enormous nerd&#x2014;and when I&#x2019;m the one saying that, it means something. After all, I&#x2019;m the girl who shares her room with a floor-to-ceiling bookshelf full of X-Men trades, and who once stayed up for three days straight to organize an attack plan for the Comic-Con hotel lottery. Somehow, despite all that, Artie out-nerds me.<br><br>But he&#x2019;s got good instincts. I lowered my hand. Tyler was looking thoughtfully at the box in Artie&#x2019;s hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Is this a trick?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;When you open the lid, will it be a Ouija board or something?&#x201d;<br><br>Artie looked hurt. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t screw around with the spirit world,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Aunt Mary would hit me in the head.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Damn right,&#x201d; said Mary, appearing next to him. &#x201c;And you shouldn&#x2019;t believe all the press about Ouija boards. They can&#x2019;t be used in an exorcism. Trivial Pursuit can, but that&#x2019;s another story. Come on, kid. What can it hurt?&#x201d;<br><br>Tyler looked at Mary, frowning. Finally, he heaved a heavy sigh and said, &#x201c;I guess. But I get firsts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No problem,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>* * * * *<br><br>The four of us sat on the floor around the board, which Artie had laid out with the utmost care, as fussy as if he were getting set up in a clean, well-lit game store, and not in a decrepit house that would probably be condemned as soon as it stopped being haunted. (Most construction firms are sensibly hands-off about really haunted houses, even if they don&#x2019;t like to admit that ghosts are real. There&#x2019;s making a profit and then there&#x2019;s getting possessed. Only one of them is good for business.) I was going to need a six-hour shower when we got out of here, after all the things I&#x2019;d touched without meaning to.<br><br>On the plus side, the game seemed to be helping. Tyler was still blue and faintly transparent, but at least he looked like a kid again, and not the sort of thing that had been designed to give me nightmares for the rest of my life.<br><br>Our little robots were making good progress through their robotic death factory, even if Tyler never touched the cards or pieces. He just looked at them and they moved. There was a good chance he was cheating, since he could presumably control which card he pulled from the deck, but it didn&#x2019;t seem worth pointing out, especially since we were supposed to be calming him down, not getting into a weird family game night fight. Besides, it wasn&#x2019;t like he was hurting anyone.<br><br>Unlike Tyler, Mary used her hands when it was her turn to move, pulling her cards with relish, leaning across anyone who got in her way in order to reach her avatar. Like Tyler, she had allowed herself to grow less and less solid, until she&#x2019;d become transparent enough for me to see right through her. It seemed to be helping him calm down. He kept stealing little glances in her direction, like he couldn&#x2019;t believe another ghost would take this sort of interest in him. Or that <i>anyone </i>would take this sort of interest in him. Like most poltergeists, he&#x2019;d been confined to the house he was haunting since his death. And he was lonely.<br><br>The more relaxed Tyler got, the more he talked, going on and on about shows he liked to watch and movies he was looking forward to seeing. He didn&#x2019;t seem to realize that it was all four years out of date. Most of his shows had been canceled; most of those movies had not only been released, they had come out on DVD and been consigned to the bargain shelf. He was a boy without a country in more ways than one.<br><br>Artie caught my eye and grimaced. I wrinkled my nose in apology. Artie and his sister Elsie are only half-human. Their father, my Uncle Ted, is an incubus. Artie inherited his father&#x2019;s empathic abilities, which would be a neat superpower to have if we lived in a world where wearing spandex out of the house was not only socially acceptable but magically automatically flattering. Instead, poor Artie gets to pick up the emotional state of every living person around him, whether he wants to or not. Since Mary and Tyler weren&#x2019;t alive, they weren&#x2019;t putting off emotions he could read. But I was. And I was feeling so much pity for Tyler that it must have been like swimming through treacle.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I mouthed.<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2019;S okay,&#x201d; he mouthed back.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you whispering about?&#x201d; asked Tyler suspiciously.<br><br>We hadn&#x2019;t been whispering&#x2014;we hadn&#x2019;t been making a sound&#x2014;but it was a good opening. &#x201c;Whose turn it is to do the dishes. It&#x2019;s Artie&#x2019;s. He always tries to get out of it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So do you,&#x201d; said Artie.<br><br>I stuck my tongue out at him. Tyler giggled.<br><br>He was starting to sound like a real kid again. &#x201c;What did you want to be when you grew up, Tyler?&#x201d; I asked, trying to make my tone light.<br><br>He glanced at me through the translucent fringe of his hair. &#x201c;A football player. Or maybe a fireman. I was trying to make up my mind when I got hit.&#x201d; His lips drew downward. &#x201c;I guess it doesn&#x2019;t matter now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe, maybe not,&#x201d; said Mary. &#x201c;I know some ghost kids who still like to play football. Best part? You can&#x2019;t get hurt when you&#x2019;re dead. So they can just tackle and shove and do whatever they want, forever. And it&#x2019;s never time to go in for dinner, and there&#x2019;s never homework to make them stop playing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; asked Tyler. &#x201c;What if I wanted to be a fireman?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a poltergeist, right?&#x201d; asked Artie. &#x201c;I mean, if you figured out how to control what you can do, and you decided what you really wanted to do with your time was fight fires, I bet you could. You could get the water and the foam deeper into the building, you could move smoke away from kids who are trapped . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t be the first,&#x201d; said Mary. &#x201c;There are lots of constructive ways to haunt.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; asked Tyler again. He seemed more solid, and almost hopeful. Then he flickered, becoming a cellophane boy. &#x201c;What about my parents?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not everyone becomes a ghost,&#x201d; said Mary. &#x201c;Mostly only people who feel like they&#x2019;re leaving something behind. Because you died so young, they&#x2019;re likely to hurry on to whatever comes after this world, looking for you. I&#x2019;m sorry. You probably won&#x2019;t see them until you decide to move past haunting. But maybe you will. Sticking around to see can&#x2019;t hurt anything, and it might make you feel less like you got cheated out of everything you should have had.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I <i>did</i> get cheated,&#x201d; said Tyler. That horror movie mask was starting to ooze around the edges of his face again, darkening the whole room. &#x201c;That man shouldn&#x2019;t have been driving. I was being good. I was following the rules. I just wanted to go <i>home</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>The game board began to shake. Artie looked alarmed. Right. If there&#x2019;s one thing I&#x2019;ve learned from being the youngest of three, it&#x2019;s how to throw a good tantrum&#x2014;and how to defuse one.<br><br>&#x201c;You got screwed,&#x201d; I said amiably. Tyler&#x2019;s face stopped shifting toward the horrific and snapped back into little boy innocence as he turned to gape at me. I shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s true. You got screwed over. That asshole stole every year you should have had. Your high school, dating, college, kids if that&#x2019;s what you wanted, everything, he took it, because he couldn&#x2019;t take a taxi home after slamming back a few beers. God, that sucks. I&#x2019;d be mad, too. I don&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;d be &#x2018;haunt the house I lived in, throwing the furniture at people&#x2019; mad, but who knows? It didn&#x2019;t happen to me. Even if you brought the roof down on my head right now&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uh, maybe don&#x2019;t give him ideas?&#x201d; said Artie, with a nervous glance at the ceiling.<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2014;I would still have lived longer and done more than you ever got to, and I am sorry, and that is fucked up, but throwing shit at us is not going to make it better, and it&#x2019;s not going to make you alive again.&#x201d; I gestured to Mary. &#x201c;She wants to take you someplace where you can meet other kids who got screwed like you did. You can make friends. You can do stuff. And, yeah, you can wait to see if your parents come to join you. You&#x2019;re a ghost. You&#x2019;ve got time. Maybe this isn&#x2019;t what you would have chosen, but it&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;ve got, so make the best of it.&#x201d;</p><h2>Essential Perennials: The Complete Reference to 2700 Perennials for the Home Garden</h2><p><p><i>Essential Perennials</i>&nbsp;focuses on what every gardener needs to know to&nbsp;choose from the thousands of perennials available, and care for the ones you already have.&nbsp;This A-to-Z guide is packed with more than 2,700 plants, with each entry listing flower color, bloom time, foliage characteristics, size, and light and temperature requirements.

Valente. Now she weaves a lyrically erotic spell of a place where the grotesque and the beautiful reside and the passport to our most secret fantasies begins with a stranger&#x2019;s kiss....<b><br><br></b>Between life and death, dreaming and waking, at the train stop beyond the end of the world is the city of Palimpsest. To get there is a miracle, a mystery, a gift, and a curse&#x2014;a voyage permitted only to those who&#x2019;ve always believed there&#x2019;s another world than the one that meets the eye. Those fated to make the passage are marked forever by a map of that wondrous city tattooed on their flesh after a single orgasmic night. To this kingdom of ghost trains, lion-priests, living kanji, and cream-filled canals come four travelers: Oleg, a New York locksmith; the beekeeper November; Ludovico, a binder of rare books; and a young Japanese woman named Sei. They&#x2019;ve each lost something important&#x2014;a wife, a lover, a sister, a direction in life&#x2014;and what they will find in Palimpsest is more than they could ever imagine.</p><p>Catherynne M. Valente was born in the Pacific Northwest, grew up in California, and now lives in Ohio with her two dogs.<i>Chapter One<br>Sic Transit Tokyo<br></i><br>Sei pressed her cheek against the cold glass; strips of black mountains tore by under lantern-blue clouds beyond her wide window. She knew a man was watching her&#x2014;the way men on trains always watched her. The train car rocked gently from side to side, hushing its charges like a worried mother. She chewed on the ends of her dark blue hair. A stupid childhood habit, but Sei couldn't let it go. She let the wet curl fall back against her bare shoulder blades. She stroked the glass with her fingertips, shifted her hips against the white of the carriage&#x2014;she was always moved to do this on the long-distance trains which crisscrossed the islands like corset stays. They were so pale and pure and unfathomably fast, like iridescent snakes hissing down to the sea. The Shinkansen was always pristine, always perfect, its aim always true.<br><br>Sei's skin prickled as the man's eyes slid over her back. She felt their cold black weight, shifting her shoulders to bear up under it. He would be watching the small of her back now, where her silver-black shirt fell away into a mess of carefully arranged silk ropes and tin chains. He would watch her angles under the strings, the crease of her legs beneath an immodest skirt, her lips moving against the glass. The little wet fog of her breath. She could almost tell what he looked like without turning her head: good black suit, a little too small, clutching his briefcase like a talisman, probably a little gray at the temples, no rings on his hands. They all looked like that.<br><br>Sei turned, her blue hair brushing her hipbones. Good black suit, a little too small, clutched briefcase, freckles of gray in the hair. No rings. He did not seem startled or doubled over with desire as they sometimes were. He was calm, his answering smile measured and almost sweet, like a photograph of a soldier lost in a long-ago war. Coolly, without taking his dark eyes from hers, he turned over his left palm and rested it on the creamy brown edge of his briefcase.<br><br>His hand was covered in a mark she first thought horrible&#x2014;it snaked and snarled, black and swollen, where fortune-teller's lines ought to have been. Like a spider it sent long web-spokes out from a circle in the center, shooting towards the pads of his fingers and burrowing into the tiny webbing of skin between them. She took a step forward, balancing expertly as the car sped on, and stared. It was something like a little map, drawn there by an inartful and savage hand. She could make out minuscule lettering along the inky corridors: street names she could hardly read. There seemed even to be an arcane compass near his thumb. As she leaned in, the man shut his fist.<br><br>"Sato Kenji," he said, his voice neither high nor low, but cultured, clipped, quiet. <br><br>"Amaya Sei."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>He quirked an eyebrow briefly, slightly, in such a way that no one afterwards might be able to safely accuse him of having done it. Sei knew the look. Names are meaningless, plosives and breath, but those who liked the slope of her waist often made much of hers, which denoted purity, clarity&#x2014;as though it had any more in the way of depth than others. They wondered, all of them, if she really was pure, as pure as her name announced her to be, all white banners and hymeneal grace. <br>She balanced one hand&#x2014;many-ringed&#x2014;on her hip and jerked her head in the manner of a fox snuffling the air for roasting things. "What's wrong with your hand?"<br><br>"Nothing." Kenji smiled in his long-ago way again. She quirked her own eyebrow, also blue, and delicately pierced with a frosted ring. He gestured for her to sit down and, though she knew better, they sat together for a moment, her body held tense and tight, ready to run, to cry out if need be. Their thighs touched&#x2014;a gesture of intimacy she had never allowed herself with another passenger.<br><br>"I think you like trains rather too much, Sei." The older man smelled of sandalwood and the peculiar thin scent of clean train cars.<br><br>"I'm not sure how that's any of your business."<br><br>"It isn't, of course. I like them, too. I own a car, I have no need to ride the Shinkansen back and forth from Tokyo to Kyoto like some kind of Bedouin. It's an expensive habit. But love is love, and love is compulsion. I must, and I do." <br><br>He gently tapped the brass clasp on his briefcase and drew out a slender book, bound in black, its title embossed in silver:<br>A History of Train Travel on the Japanese Isles, <br>by Sato Kenji<br><br>Sei ran her hand over the cover as she had done the window glass. Her skin felt hot, too small for her bones. He opened the book&#x2014;the pages were thick and expensive, so that the stamp of the press had almost made little valleys of the kanji, the cream-colored paper rising slightly above the ink. Kenji took her hand in his. His fingernails were very clean.&nbsp; He read to her with the low, vibratory tones of shared obsession.<br><br>A folktale current in Hokkaido just after the war and passed from conductor to conductor held that the floor of heaven is laced with silver train tracks, and the third rail is solid pearl. The trains that ran along them were fabulous even by the standards of the Shinkansen of today: carriages containing whole pine forests hung with golden lanterns, carriages full of rice terraces, carriages lined in red silk where the meal service brought soup, rice-balls, and a neat lump of opium with persimmon tea poured over it in the most delicate of cups. These trains sped past each other, utterly silent, carrying each a complement of ghosts who clutched the branches like leather handholds, and plucked the green rice to eat raw, and fell back insensate into the laps of women whose faces were painted red from brow to chin. They never stop, never slow, and only with great courage and grace could a spirit slowly progress from car to car, all the way to the conductor's cabin, where all accounts cease, and no man knows what lies therein.<br><br>In Hokkaido, where the snow and ice are so white and pure that they glow blue, it is said that only the highest engineers of Japan Railways know the layout of the railroads on the floor of heaven. They say that those exalted engineers are working, slowly, generation by generation, to lay the tracks on earth so that they mirror exactly the tracks in heaven. When this is done, those marvelous carriages will fall from the sky, and we may know on earth, without paying the terrible fare of death, the gaze of the red women, the light of the forest lanterns, and the taste of persimmon tea.<br><br>Sato Kenji looked up from his book and into Sei's eyes. She knew her face was flushed and red&#x2014;she did not care. Her hands shook, her legs ached. She could not harness her breath. She did not need these trains for simple transport either, but longed for them, the cold rush of their passing as she stood on the wind-whipped platform, the slink of doors sliding closed behind her as the train accepted her as its own. That ache had begun long before Kenji had come on board. She felt their hands touching, their train-haunted hands. She took his book from his easy grip and held it to her, her heart beating against it, as if to read it through bone and flesh and leather, directly, needfully, ventricle pressed to page. A kind of knowledge passed between them&#x2014;she would not return it, and he would not ask for it back.<br><br>Instead&#x2014;and later she would wonder why she did it, why such a thing would have occurred to her, and will never be able to say&#x2014;she took Sato Kenji by their linked hands and led him to the rickety, shivering place between the carriage cars, where the wind keened and crooned through the cracks in the grating and the white walls gave way to chrome. She kissed the gray of his hair. The space between them was thick, crackling, and though she told herself that it was unwise, a reckless thing, she moved through that wild, manic air and into him, his mouth, his skin.<br><br>He buried his face in her neck and, as though she weighed nothing, hefted her up against the carriage door, her blue hair flattening against the glass. Sei let out a small cry, like the whistle of an engine, and ground against him, shifting to let him enter her, his breath warm and even against her collarbone. His palm was pressed against her back, the black mark hot there, a sear, a brand. Sei clutched his book against his back and shut her eyes, feeling the train jerk and jolt against her. She felt enormous, cracked open, as though she had taken all of the great train into herself, as though the shuddering, scholarly thrusts of Sato Kenji were the loving gestures of her beloved Shinkansen, only guided by the man with the briefcase, guided up and out of him, guided into her, guided across the silver tracks of heaven. <br><i><br>Chapter Two<br>Cities of the Bees<br></i><br><br>There is a place on the interstate where the last black fingernails of Los Angeles fall away and the whole of the San Joaquin valley spreads out below the mountains, impossibly golden, checkered in green and wheat and strawberry fields and orange groves and infinitely long rows of radishes, where the land is shriven of all the sins of palm-bound, artifice-mad Southern California. <br><br>November knew that place, knew it so well that her bare foot on the gas pedal throbbed as it approached, as her little green car, heavy with produce, crested the last rise in the tangled highways of the Grapevine, and the light began to change, gratefully, from raw, livid brume to a gold like the blood of saints. Her throat caught as the great, soft fields unfolded below her, yawning, stretching all the way to San Francisco and further still, to the redwoods and Oregon, all the way up.<br><br>She had often imagined, as a girl, when her mother drove back and forth between the two great cities of the west, that I-5 went on simply forever, past Canada to the North Pole, where the center divider would be wrapped up in ice and the bridges cut out of arctic stone. Even now, charting the coast in her own right, she sometimes thought of ignoring the off-ramps and speeding up and up, to the cold stars and fox-haunted glaciers. But in the end, it was always the city of St. Francis that stopped her, and the rest of the world was lost behind a curtain of fog and gnarled red trees. <br><br>She could never escape the feeling of strange Spanish holiness that California bestowed&#x2014;the cities named for saints, angels, benediction. The capital itself a sacrament. Like communion wafers she tasted the places on her tongue, the red roof tiles blood-vivid. Her own blood bisected the state, her mother, retired, warming her bones against the southern sea, her father, dead ten years, buried in the wet northern moss. <br><br>They met in the south, on a dock far out in the frothing turquoise Pacific, her young mother in rolled-up olive overalls with a great long knife in her hands, slaughtering a small blue shark she had caught by accident, trying for salmon. She was bloody to her elbows, her clothes a ruin, arterial spray across her cheek. Her father tied his little sailboat to the pier and she looked up at him over a carcass of silver and scarlet. They had both laughed.<br><br>Long before he died, November's father was gone, up north, away from his wife and the sea. They could not bear each other, in the end, and perhaps a thing begun in blood and death and salt must end that way. They could not live with less than three mountain ranges to separate them. And between them they strung their daughter, and like a shining black bead counting out refutations of love, she slowly slid back and forth, back and forth. Finally, she had settled on her father's country, and left the loud blues and golds of the south, unable to bear them herself.<br><br>She did not live in San Francisco, of course. She could not afford it. But she was drawn to it, rising up from the bay like the star of the sea, resting in a shell, all blue veils and promises of absolution. And at night it was a mass of light at the end of all those bridges, all those highways, looking east with huge black eyes. <br><br>November kept her father's grave in Benicia, holding tenuously to the town's boldly proclaimed blessings, and with the grave she tended sixteen hexagonal beehives. She had named all the queens. She kept for them pristine and intricate gardens to flavor their feet, and the honey in turn, and it was this golden science that occupied the small and guarded territory of her interior, even as she traveled the long, slow road out of the desert, her trunk full of sleeping yucca bulbs and infant jacarandas, their roots bound up in earth and linen. Even as she found herself turning from the last scrap of highway and into the interminable column of cars creeping across the great iron mass of the Bay Bridge. <br><br>How we are willing to wait, she thought, like a line of penitent adulterers at a white altar, to be allowed into the city. How we gather at this dull gray gate, knowing that the golden one is a lie. It is only there for show. The faithful know that God lives nowhere near gold. The tourists gawk at the orange cathedral, while the wise gather here, in the low and long, waiting patiently to hand over their coins and be permitted, for a moment, to look upon, but not touch, the mass of jewels and offerings in which San Francisco wallows.<br><br>November drove slowly in, and the water below her was black. She sought out Chinatown reflexively, found a shop cashiered by a spectacled biology student which sold star anise and scallions. She loved Chinatown at three in the morning&#x2014;the reds and greens were muted, shadowed into black by the gaps between streetlamps. It was secret, lonely; every pink neon character seemed brave against the dark.<br><br>It took skill, a mapmaker's skill, to find an open restaurant that would not turn a lone woman away, sure that her cup of coffee and wonton soup are hardly worth the effort of clearing a table. But on that night of all nights, November needed only a half an hour's cartomancy before she found one, and the starchy benevolence of a plate full of steaming soup dumplings, braised pork, and peppered oysters. <br><br>The booth was hard, cracked vinyl the color of a Chevrolet interior left in the sun for twenty years. A television mounted in the ceiling corner flashed the news from Beijing without subtitles. Thus, her attention wandered and fell on a young woman in the next booth over sipping soup, her bright blue eyes belying Chinese features. The two women watched each other for a space, the only customers in an empty cafe&#x17d;, until finally, the other woman placed one delicate finger against her iris and deftly slid the contact lens aside like a curtain, quirking a smile as the wrinkled lens showed black beneath. <br><br>When November tries to remember this night a year from now, she will think the woman's name was Xiaohui. She will be almost sure she can remember the ring of the name, falling into her ear like a little copper bell. She will remember that they shared dumplings, and that the woman was a Berkeley student, a historian who knew the names of every one of Mohammed's grandchildren, and could recite the drifting census data of the ancient city of Karakorum, where the Khans raised tents of scarlet. <br><br>November had only her bees. They suddenly seemed paltry to her, poor and needy.</p><h2>Sense of Evil: A Bishop/Special Crimes Unit Novel</h2><p>Kay Hooper is the brightest new star of suspense fiction.

Though many believe it is pure allegory and doubt God's ability to create a whale large enough to hold a man in its belly, Dr. Henry Morris provides well-researched biblical history as a compelling defense for the literal interpretation of the book of Jonah.</p> <p>Jesus the Messiah confirms the record of Jonah as absolutely real and profoundly important in the New Testament (Matthew 16:17 and Luke 11:29-32). In <em>The Remarkable Journey of Jonah</em>, Morris reveals Jonah as a striking type of Jesus Christ making this a very important book of the Bible to study. This verse-by-verse Bible study commentary provides compelling new viewpoints and corollaries between Jonah and Jesus.</p> <p>Don't miss the fascinating detail and historical accuracy with which Morris also discusses:</p> <ul> <li>The length of time Jonah was in the whale</li> <li>Jonah's prayer while in hell</li> <li>Nineveh's influence</li> <li>God's compassion</li> <li>Practical ways Jonah's account applies to the 21st Century</li> </ul> <p>Henry Morris, an acclaimed Christian apologist, presents this scholarly and yet simple to read Bible study reference for individuals and groups. <em>The Remarkable Journey of Jonah</em> is highly recommended for laymen as well as pastors, teachers, and Bible scholars.</p></p><p><p>Henry Morris became the foremost proponent of scientific creationism, and the "foundation-layer" for today's large and powerful creation movement. His passion, however, is Scripture and seeing unbelievers come to trust its claims and believers strengthened in their faith in its accuracy and application. The late Henry M. Morris PhD leaves a "No-Compromise" legacy library of over 60 books on creation science, Christian apologetics, and Bible commentaries aiding readers in accepting the inerrancy of the Holy Bible.</p><p>This biblical commentary contains rich insights into the nature of God and His dealings with man. As you read, notice the closely constructed logical arguments, and the winsome defense of opinions not universally shared by expositors. The book is so well written and so engaging you'll find yourself nodding in agreement and exclaiming, "Of course! Now I understand. Why didn't I see it before?"</p> --John D. Morris, President of the Institute for Creation Research</p><h2>Effi Briest (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>In 1919 Thomas Mann hailed&nbsp;<b>Effi Briest</b>&nbsp;(1895) as one of "the six most significant novels ever written." Set in Bismarck's Germany, Fontane's luminous tale of a socially suitable but emotionally disastrous match between the enchanting seventeen-year-old Effi and an austere, workaholic civil servant twice her age, is at once touching and unsettling. Fontane's taut, ironic narrative depicts a world where sexuality and the enjoyment of life are stifled by narrow-mindedness and circumstance. Considered by many to be the pinnacle of the nineteenth-century German novel,&nbsp;<b>Effi Briest</b>&nbsp;is a tale of adultery that ranks with&nbsp;<b>Madame Bovary</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Anna Karenina</b>&nbsp;and brilliantly demonstrates the truth of the author's comment and "women's stories are generally far more interesting."<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Dr. Poythress also explains how the penalties of the law prefigure the destruction of sin and guilt through Jesus.<br><br>Christ himself is the key that unlocks the riches of the Old Testament.

Since his release from federal prison, in 1998, Mitnick has turned his life around and established himself as one of the most sought-after computer security experts worldwide. Now, in The Art of Deception, the world's most notorious hacker gives new meaning to the old adage, "It takes a thief to catch a thief."<br> Focusing on the human factors involved with information security, Mitnick explains why all the firewalls and encryption protocols in the world will never be enough to stop a savvy grifter intent on rifling a corporate database or an irate employee determined to crash a system. With the help of many fascinating true stories of successful attacks on business and government, he illustrates just how susceptible even the most locked-down information systems are to a slick con artist impersonating an IRS agent. Narrating from the points of view of both the attacker and the victims, he explains why each attack was so successful and how it could have been prevented in an engaging and highly readable style reminiscent of a true-crime novel. And, perhaps most importantly, Mitnick offers advice for preventing these types of social engineering hacks through security protocols, training programs, and manuals that address the human element of security.</p><p><i>The Art of Deception</i> is about gaining someone's trust by lying to them and then abusing that trust for fun and profit. Hackers use the euphemism "social engineering" and hacker-guru Kevin Mitnick examines many example scenarios.<p>After Mitnick's first dozen examples anyone responsible for organizational security is going to lose the will to live. It's been said before, but people and security are antithetical. Organizations exist to provide a good or service and want helpful, friendly employees to promote the good or service. People are social animals who want to be liked. Controlling the human aspects of security means denying someone something. This circle can't be squared.</p><p>Considering Mitnick's reputation as a hacker guru, it's ironic that the last point of attack for hackers using social engineering are computers. Most of the scenarios in <i>The Art of Deception</i> work just as well against computer-free organizations and were probably known to the Phoenicians; technology simply makes it all easier. Phones are faster than letters, after all, and having large organizations means dealing with lots of strangers.</p><p>Much of Mitnick's security advice sounds practical until you think about implementation, when you realize that more effective security means reducing organizational efficiency--an impossible trade in competitive business. And anyway, who wants to work in an organization where the rule is "Trust no one"? Mitnick shows how easily security is breached by trust, but without trust people can't live and work together. In the real world, effective organizations have to acknowledge that total security is a chimera--and carry more insurance. <i>--Steve Patient, amazon.co.uk</i></p>A legendary hacker reveals how to guard against the gravest security risk of all-human nature<br> <br> "...a tour de force, a series of tales of how some old-fashioned blarney and high-tech skills can pry any information from anyone.

Now, in The Art of Deception, the world's most famous hacker gives new meaning to the old adage, "It takes a thief to catch a thief."<br> <br> Inviting you into the complex mind of the hacker, Mitnick provides realistic scenarios of cons, swindles, and social engineering attacks on businesses-and the consequences. Focusing on the human factors involved with information security, Mitnick explains why all the firewalls and encryption protocols in the world will never be enough to stop a savvy grifter intent on rifling a corporate database or an irate employee determined to crash a system.

He shares his advice for preventing security vulnerability in the hope that people will be mindfully on guard for an attack from the gravest risk of all-human nature.</p><h2>Refuge: Rethinking Refugee Policy in a Changing World</h2><p>Global refugee numbers are at their highest levels since the end of World War II, but the system in place to deal with them, based upon a humanitarian list of imagined "basic needs," has changed little. In <em>Refuge</em>, Paul Collier and Alexander Betts argue that the system fails to provide a comprehensive solution to the fundamental problem, which is how to reintegrate displaced people into society. Western countries deliver food, clothing, and shelter to refugee camps, but these sites, usually located in remote border locations, can make things worse. The numbers are stark: the average length of stay in a refugee camp worldwide is 17 years. Into this situation comes the Syria crisis, which has dislocated countless families, bringing them to face an impossible choice: huddle in dangerous urban desolation, rot in dilapidated camps, or flee across the Mediterranean to increasingly unwelcoming governments.<br><br><em>Refuge</em> seeks to restore moral purpose and clarity to refugee policy. Rather than assuming indefinite dependency, Collier-author of <em>The Bottom Billion</em>-and his Oxford colleague Betts propose a humanitarian approach integrated with a new economic agenda that begins with jobs, restores autonomy, and rebuilds people's ability to help themselves and their societies. Timely and urgent, the book goes beyond decrying scenes of desperation to declare what so many people, policymakers and public alike, are anxious to hear: that a long-term solution really is within reach.<br></p><p><br><strong>Alexander Betts</strong> is the Leopold W. Muller Professor of Forced Migration and International Affairs at the University of Oxford, where he is also Director of the Refugee Studies Centre. He has previously worked for UNHCR and as a consultant to a range of international organizations and governments.<br><br><strong>Paul Collier</strong> is Professor of Economics at St. Antony's College, Oxford. His book <em>The Bottom Billion</em> has won the Lionel Gelber Prize, the Arthur Ross Prize awarded by the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Corine Prize.<br><br><em>refuge</em> makes some very importnant points on a hugely important topic. ts, Amherst, <em>Journal of American Ethnic H Massachuset<p></p></em><br>"Among other elements of autonomy and humanitarianism, the authors vigorously discuss the absolute necessity of jobs to create "a workable system that can sustainably offer sanctuary to the world's refugees." A vital contribution to a discussion that should be at the top of world leaders' agendas." --<em>Kirkus</em><p></p><br>"In the end, what's more important - doing good, or the appearance of doing good? If we're as pure of heart as we like to imagine, we'll seek out the policy that saves the most people, full stop. And Refuge supplies an outstanding road map for getting us there."--<em>The National Post</em><p></p><br>"Lost in the row over Europe's migration crisis in 2015 were the millions of refugees who stayed in the developing world, unwilling or unable to journey to richer countries. Growing up in a refugee camp often means little education and no work. Two experts at Oxford University present the first comprehensive attempt in years to rethink from first principles a system that has long been hidebound by hand-wringing and old ideas."--<em>The Economist</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Cosmic Perspective, The</h2><p><p> <i>For two-semester courses in astronomy.</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Exploring the impact of new discoveries on astronomy, science, and life in the universe</b> </p> <p>Building on a long tradition of effective pedagogy and comprehensive coverage, <b> <i>The Cosmic Perspective, </i>9th Edition</b> provides a thoroughly engaging and up-to-date introduction to astronomy for anyone who is curious about the universe, regardless of prior background in astronomy or physics.

Among groups who should readily find common ground, there is little agreement. To escape this deadlock, Asad Haider turns to the rich legacies of the black freedom struggle. Drawing on the words and deeds of black revolutionary theorists, he argues that identity politics is not synonymous with anti-racism, but instead amounts to the neutralization of its movements. It marks a retreat from the crucial passage of identity to solidarity, and from individual recognition to the collective struggle against an oppressive social structure.</p><p>Weaving together autobiographical reflection, historical analysis, theoretical exegesis, and protest reportage, <i>Mistaken Identity</i> is a passionate call for a new practice of politics beyond colorblind chauvinism and &#x201c;the ideology of race.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p><b>Asad Haider</b> is a founding Editor of <i>Viewpoint Magazine</i>, an investigative journal of contemporary politics.

Haider moves deftly over difficult terrain. His prose is precise and propulsive. His Marxism is not a mausoleum but a living, breathing thing. And he writes as both a militant and a theorist, one who believes that theory is integral to political struggle and that theoretical rigour has political stakes.

Although he never overwhelms the reader with unexplained jargon, the range of work he engages with is impressive, including that of Althusser, Judith Butler, Wendy Brown, Paul Gilroy, Stuart Hall, and more.

His landmark analysis shows how the notion of popular sovereignty&#x2015;the unexpected offspring of an older, equally fictional notion, the "divine right of kings"&#x2015;has worked in our history and remains a political force today.</p><p>Edmund S. Morgan (1916&#x2013;2013) was the Sterling Professor Emeritus at Yale University and the recipient of the National Humanities Medal, the Pulitzer Prize, and the American Academy&#x2019;s Gold Medal. The author of The Genuine Article; American Slavery, American Freedom; Benjamin Franklin; and American Heroes, among many others.For Morgan, popular sovereigntygovernment of, by and for the peopleis a myth. Professor emeritus of history at Yale, he argues, in effect, that representative democracy is a tool to bolster rule by the powerful few over the many; the majority are thus led to believe they control their own destiny. In this quietly subversive rereading of our history, American colonists perfected the fiction of popular rule by involving voters in extravagant electoral campaigns and by insisting that elected representatives derived their power from their constituents. Meanwhile, elitist colonial rulers who owned considerable property pulled strings to get their way.

Crazy Horse, perhaps the greatest Indian war leader of the 1800s, and Black Elk, the holy man whose teachings achieved worldwide renown, were Oglala; in these typically perceptive pages, Frazier seeks out their descendants on Pine Ridge&#x2015;a/k/a "the rez"&#x2015;which is one of the poorest places in America today. </p><p>Along with his longtime friend Le War Lance (whom he first wrote about in his 1989 bestseller, <i>Great Plains</i>) and other Oglala companions, Frazier fully explores the rez as they visit friends and relatives, go to pow-wows and rodeos and package stores, and tinker with a variety of falling-apart cars. He takes us inside the world of the Sioux as few writers ever have, writing with much wit, compassion, and imagination. In the career of SuAnne Big Crow, for example, the most admired Oglala basketball player of all time, who died in a car accident in 1992, Frazier finds a contemporary reemergence of the death-defying, public-spirited Sioux hero who fights with grace and glory to save her followers. </p><p><i>On the Rez</i> vividly portrays the survival, through toughness and humor, of a great people whose culture has helped to shape the American identity.</p></p><p>Given that the Great Plains long functioned as a stomping ground for the Oglala Sioux, it was inevitable that Ian Frazier would cross paths with them when he wrote his 1989 chronicle of that sublime flatland. But the encounter between the self-confessed "chintzy middle-class white guy" and his Native American counterparts went so swimmingly that Crazy Horse assumed a starring role in the book. Now Frazier continues his cross-cultural romance in <i>On the Rez</i>. This account of the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota is as touching, funny, and maniacally digressive as anything he's written. What's more, he manages to avoid most of the politically correct potholes along the way, producing a vivid, ambivalent (i.e., honest) portrait of a community where the very "landscape is dense with stories."<p> Much of <i>On the Rez</i> revolves around Le War Lance, whom Frazier first met in <i>Great Plains</i>. This yarn-spinning, beer-swilling figure serves the author as a kind of Native American Virgil, introducing him to the hard facts of reservation life. In fact, their friendship, with its accents of deep affection and dependency, anchors the entire narrative and elicits some typically top-drawer prose: </p><blockquote> Le's eyes can be merry and flat as a smile button, or deep and glittering with malice or slyness or something he knows and I never will. He is fifty-seven years old. I have seen his hair, which is black streaked with gray, when it was over two feet long and held with beaded ponytail holders a foot or so apart, and I have seen it much shorter, after he had shaved his head in mourning for a friend who had died. </blockquote> <i>On the Rez</i> delivers a history of the Oglala nation that spotlights our paleface population in some of its most shameful, backstabbing moments, as well as a quick tour through Indian America. The latter, to be honest, seems a little too conscientiously cooked up from primary sources and news clippings. But elsewhere Frazier is in superb form, reporting everything he sees and hears with enviable clarity and promptly pulling the rug out from under himself whenever he seems too omniscient. Few accounts of reservation life have been this comical; even fewer have moved beyond the poverty and pandemic drunk driving to discern actual, theological wickedness on the premises: "At such moments a sense of compound evil--the evil of the human heart, in league with the original darkness of this wild continent--curls around me like shoots of a fast-growing vine." In the hands of many a writer, the previous sentence might resemble a rhetorical firecracker. In Frazier's, it comes off as a statement of fact--which is only one of the reasons why every American, Native or not, should take a look at this sad, splendid, and surprisingly hopeful book. <i>--James Marcus</i><b>Ian Frazier</b> lives in Montclair, New Jersey.

HIS NAME was Reeve Maxfield, and I loved him and then he died, and almost a year passed and no one knew what to do with me. Finally it was decided that the best thing would be to send me here. But if you ask anyone on staff or faculty, they&#x2019;ll insist I was sent here because of &#x201c;the lingering effects of trauma.&#x201d; Those are the words that my parents wrote on the application to get me into The Wooden Barn, which is described in the brochure as a boarding school for &#x201c;emotionally fragile, highly intelligent&#x201d; teenagers.</p><p>On the line where it says &#x201c;Reason student is applying to The Wooden Barn,&#x201d; your parents can&#x2019;t write &#x201c;Because of a boy.&#x201d; </p><p>But it&#x2019;s the truth. </p><p>When I was little I loved my mom and dad and my brother, Leo, who followed me everywhere and said, &#x201c;Jammy, <i>wait.</i>&#x201d; When I got older I loved my ninth-grade math teacher, Mr. Mancardi, even though my math skills were deeply subnormal. &#x201c;Ah, Jam Gallahue, welcome,&#x201d; Mr. Mancardi would say when I came to first period late, my hair still wet from a shower; sometimes, in winter, with the ends frozen like baby twigs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tickled that you decided to join us.&#x201d; He never said it in a nasty tone of voice. I actually think he was tickled.</p><p>I was in love with Reeve in a fierce way that I&#x2019;d never been in love with anyone before in all my fifteen years. After I met him, the kinds of love I&#x2019;d felt for those other people suddenly seemed basic and lame. I realized there are different levels of love, just like different levels of math. Down the hall in school back then, in Advanced Math, a bunch of geniuses sat sharing the latest gossip about parallelograms. Meanwhile, in Mr. Mancardi&#x2019;s Dumb Math, we all sat around in a math fog, our mouths half open as we stared in confusion at the ironically named Smart Board.&nbsp;</p><p>So I&#x2019;d been in a very dumb <i>love</i> fog without even knowing it. And then, suddenly, I understood there was such a thing as Advanced Love. </p><p>Reeve Maxfield was one of three tenth-grade exchange students, having decided to take a break from his life in London, England, one of the most exciting cities in the world, to spend a semester in our suburb of Crampton, New Jersey, to live with dull, cheerful jock Matt Kesman and his family. </p><p>Reeve was different from the boys I knew&#x2014;all those Alexes, Joshes, and Matts. It wasn&#x2019;t just his name. He had a look that none of them had: very smart, slouching and lean, with skinny black jeans hanging low over knobby hip bones. He looked like a member of one of those British punk bands from the eighties that my dad still loves, and whose albums he keeps in special plastic sleeves because he&#x2019;s positive they&#x2019;re going to be worth a lot of money someday. Once I looked up one of my dad&#x2019;s most prized albums on eBay and saw that someone had bid sixteen cents for it, which for some reason made me want to cry. </p><p>The covers of my dad&#x2019;s albums usually show a bunch of ironic-looking boys standing together on a street corner, sharing a private joke. Reeve would have fit right in. He had dark brown hair swirling across a pale, pale face, because apparently there&#x2019;s no sunlight in England. &#x201c;Really? None? Total darkness?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said when he insisted this was true.</p><p>&#x201c;Pretty much,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said. &#x201c;The whole country is like a big, damp house where the electricity&#x2019;s been turned off. And everyone&#x2019;s lacking vitamin D. Even the queen.&#x201d; He said all this with a straight face. There was a <i>scrape</i> to his voice. And though I don&#x2019;t have any idea what people thought of him back in London, where that kind of accent is ordinary, to me his voice sounded like a lit match being held to the edge of a piece of brittle paper. It just exploded in a quiet burst. When he spoke I wanted to listen. </p><p>I also wanted to look at him nonstop: the pale face, the brown eyes, the flyaway hair. He was like a long beaker in chemistry class, and the top was always bubbling over because some interesting process was taking place inside.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve now compared Reeve Maxfield to both math and chemistry. But in the end the only class that came to matter in all of this was English. It wasn&#x2019;t my English class at Crampton Regional; it was the one I took much later, at The Wooden Barn up in Vermont, after Reeve was gone and I could barely live. </p><p>For reasons I didn&#x2019;t understand, I was one of five students tapped to be in a class called Special Topics in English. What happened in that class is something that none of us have ever talked about to anyone else. Though of course we think about it all the time, and I imagine we&#x2019;ll think about it for the rest of our lives. And the thing that amazes me the most, the thing I keep obsessing about, is this: If I hadn&#x2019;t lost Reeve, and if I hadn&#x2019;t been sent away to that boarding school, and if I hadn&#x2019;t been one of five &#x201c;emotionally fragile, highly intelligent&#x201d; teenagers in Special Topics in English, whose lives had been destroyed in five different ways, then I would never have known about Belzhar.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER</p><p>1</p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;JESUS, JAM, YOU&#x2019;D BETTER GET UP ALREADY,&#x201d; SAYS my roommate, DJ Kawabata, an emo girl from Coral Gables, Florida, with &#x201c;certain food issues,&#x201d; as she put it vaguely. She looms over my bed, her black hair hanging in my face. Because of DJ, our room is a treasure hunt of hidden food: Twizzlers, granola bars, boxes of raisins, even a squeeze bottle of some off-brand of ketchup called, I think, <i>Hind&#x2019;s</i>, as if the company hoped that people would get confused and buy it. All of it has been planted strategically for so-called emergencies. </p><p>I&#x2019;ve been living at The Wooden Barn for only one day, and I haven&#x2019;t witnessed one of my roommate&#x2019;s emergencies yet, but she assures me they&#x2019;re coming. &#x201c;They always come,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, shrugging, when she first tried to explain what it would be like to share a room with her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to see some shit you wish you&#x2019;d never seen before. But don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;m talking <i>figurative</i> shit. I&#x2019;m not seriously unhinged.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Seriously unhinged&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t get admitted to The Wooden Barn. This place isn&#x2019;t a hospital, and they make a big point of how they&#x2019;re against giving out psychiatric medication. Instead, they insist that the school experience is meant to bring people together and help them heal. </p><p>I can&#x2019;t imagine that this can be true. They don&#x2019;t even let you have the Internet. They ban it completely, which just seems cruel. They also confiscate your cell phone. There&#x2019;s one ancient pay phone in the girls&#x2019; dorm, and one in the boys&#x2019;. There isn&#x2019;t any accessible Wi-Fi, so you can use your laptops for writing papers, but you can&#x2019;t research anything. You can listen to music, but you&#x2019;re out of luck if you want to go online and download new songs. You&#x2019;re cut off from everything, which makes no sense at all, because everyone at this school is already cut off in one way or another. </p><p>Although no one comes right out and says it, The Wooden Barn is sort of a halfway house between a hospital and a regular school. It&#x2019;s like a big lily pad where you can linger before you have to make the frog-leap back to ordinary life. </p><p>DJ told me she&#x2019;d previously been in a special hospital for eating disorders. The patients there were all girls, she went on, and they were constantly being weighed by nurses who wore those pediatric nurse blouses that had patterns of cutesy puppies or panda bears on them. Sometimes when their weight got too low, the girls were force-fed through tubes. </p><p>&#x201c;That happened to me once,&#x201d; DJ said. &#x201c;One of the nurses held me down, and her boobs were smashed into my face, and when I looked up, all I could see was an ocean of tiny golden retrievers.&#x201d; </p><p>By the time I arrive at The Wooden Barn, DJ has been here for two years. And this morning, on the very first day that classes begin, as she hovers above me with her hair hanging in my face like a curtain, I just want her to go away. But she won&#x2019;t. </p><p>&#x201c;Jam, you already missed breakfast,&#x201d; she says, as if she&#x2019;s my parent or something. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time for class. What&#x2019;ve you got first?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No idea.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you looked at your skedge?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My <i>&#x2018;skedge&#x2019;</i>? If you mean my schedule, no.&#x201d; </p><p>I&#x2019;d arrived the day before, having made the six-hour drive up with my parents and Leo. My mom was sort of crying the whole way but pretending it was allergies, and my dad was listening to NPR with a strange intensity. &#x201c;Today,&#x201d; said the woman on the radio, &#x201c;we are going to devote our entire show to the voices suppressed by the Taliban.&#x201d; </p><p>My dad turned up the volume and nodded his head thoughtfully, as if it were the most fascinating thing, while my mom closed her eyes and cried, not about the voices suppressed by the Taliban, but about me. </p><p>My brother, Leo, was just being himself, sitting beside me pressing buttons on the grimy little handheld in his lap. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said when he&#x2019;d beaten a level of his game and caught my eye. </p><p>&#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll suck without you in the house.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better get used to it,&#x201d; I said to him. &#x201c;Our childhood together is pretty much over.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s mean,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s true. And then eventually,&#x201d; I went on, &#x201c;one of us will die. And the other one will have to go to the funeral. And give a speech.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jam, <i>stop</i>,&#x201d; Leo said. </p><p>I immediately felt sorry about what I&#x2019;d said, and didn&#x2019;t even know why I&#x2019;d said it. I was in a bad mood all the time. Leo didn&#x2019;t deserve to be treated this way. He was only twelve, and he looked even younger. Some kids in his grade looked like they were ready to have children; Leo looked like one of the children they might&#x2019;ve had. Occasionally he got tripped in the hall, but nothing really bothered him because he&#x2019;d found a way not to care. From the time he turned ten, he&#x2019;d been obsessed with the alternative world of a video game called <i>Dream Wanderers</i> that has to do with magic cubes and apprentices and characters called driftlords. </p><p>I still have no idea what a driftlord is. At the time, I didn&#x2019;t even understand what an alternative world was, but now of course I do. And so I get what my little brother has known for a while: Sometimes an alternative world is much better than the real one. </p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t trying to be mean,&#x201d; I told Leo in the car. &#x201c;I get like this,&#x201d; I added.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom and Dad told me that when you act this way I should just let it go, because&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because why?&#x201d; My voice had an edge.</p><p>&#x201c;Because of what you&#x2019;ve been through,&#x201d; he said uneasily. He and I had barely talked about it. He was so young, and he couldn&#x2019;t possibly know what I&#x2019;d been through, what I&#x2019;d felt. </p><p>The conversation had nowhere to go, so we each looked out our separate windows, and finally Leo closed his eyes and went to sleep with his mouth open. The car was enveloped in the smell of the cool-ranch-flavored chips he&#x2019;d been eating. I felt sorry for him that he was like an only child now. That he no longer had a normal older sister. That instead he had one who&#x2019;d become destroyed enough to have to go live at a special school in another state six hours away. </p><p>Drop-off at The Wooden Barn was highly tense. My mom kept trying to arrange my room, while DJ lounged on her bed, silently watching the whole scene, clearly amused by it. </p><p>&#x201c;Be sure you give your study buddy a couple of big punches every day so the filling stays even,&#x201d; my mom said to me as I put things in drawers. </p><p>From my trunk, I took out the jar of Tiptree Little Scarlet Strawberry Preserve, the jam that Reeve had given me the night we first kissed, and I held the cool glass cylinder in my hand for a moment. I knew I&#x2019;d never open this jar. It was almost like an urn that had Reeve&#x2019;s ashes in it. The seal would remain unbroken forever. The jar was sacred to me, and I deposited it in my top dresser drawer and covered it carefully with a mess of bras and underwear and an old Tweety Bird nightshirt. </p><p>&#x201c;Just reach out and hit it, okay, Jam?&#x201d; my mom continued. &#x201c;Just hit it like it was a predator who&#x2019;s jumped you in an alley.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Mom,&#x201d;</i> I said, while DJ kept watching, not even pretending she wasn&#x2019;t. She annoyed me so much, and I couldn&#x2019;t believe I was going to have to live with her. </p><p>&#x201c;I mean, just give it a good slug all around the bottom and the sides,&#x201d; my mom continued, demonstrating how I should attack the so-called study buddy, that big pillow with arms that she&#x2019;d insisted we buy for my room at the Price Cruncher back in Crampton. </p><p>The woman at the checkout counter had smiled at us when we managed to hoist it onto the moving belt. And then she&#x2019;d said in a singsong voice, &#x201c;Is someone going to Fenster Academy?&#x201d; </p><p>Fenster Academy is the snotty boarding school not too far from my house in New Jersey where the girls have horses and everyone wears a sky-blue uniform, and sings these corny songs with bad rhymes like, &#x201c;Oh Fenster, dear Fenster, we will ne&#x2019;er forget our semesters&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Mom and I both awkwardly shook our heads no.</p><p>The study buddy was enormous, orange, and corduroy. I hated it in the store, and I hated it again when it sat on my bed in The Wooden Barn with its arms out. I even hated the name &#x201c;study buddy.&#x201d; Everyone knew I was still in no condition to study.</p><p>Apparently, though, it was time to &#x201c;knuckle down,&#x201d; or &#x201c;get with the program,&#x201d; as people said. And since I couldn&#x2019;t do that, then it was time for me to enroll at The Wooden Barn, where supposedly a combination of the Vermont air, maple syrup, no psychiatric medication, and no Internet will cure me. But I&#x2019;m not curable.</p><p>The other thing that makes the name &#x201c;study buddy&#x201d; awful is that I have no &#x201c;buddies&#x201d; anymore. Before I met Reeve and wanted to be with him all the time, my closest friends in Crampton were two other low-key, nice girls with long, straight hair&#x2014;girls like me. We worked hard at school but weren&#x2019;t nerds, and had done a little weed but weren&#x2019;t stoners. Mostly we were all considered cute-looking and sweet and sort of shy. </p><p>Actually, I don&#x2019;t think anyone thought about us all that often. We were the kind of girls who braided one another&#x2019;s hair when we were younger, and practiced synchronized dance moves, and slept over at one another&#x2019;s houses every single weekend. On those sleepovers we talked very frankly about a lot of topics, including &#x201c;relationships,&#x201d; of course, though among us only Hannah Petroski had an actual, long-term boyfriend, Ryan Brown. The two of them were really serious, and had almost had sex. </p><p>&#x201c;We are a <i>millimeter</i> away from actually doing it,&#x201d; Hannah had revealed one weekend. And though I didn&#x2019;t exactly know what that meant, I nodded and pretended I did. Hannah and Ryan had been in love since Mrs. Delahunt&#x2019;s kindergarten class. They&#x2019;d had their first kiss on a carpet remnant in the nap corner. </p><p>After I lost Reeve, my friends came around a lot at first, dropping solemnly by the house. I could hear them from my bedroom when they stood in the front hall and talked to my parents. &#x201c;Hi, Mr. Gallahue,&#x201d; one of them would say. &#x201c;Is Jam doing any better? No? Not at all? Wow, I don&#x2019;t really know what to say. Well, I baked her some snickerdoodles&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; </p><p>But when they knocked on my bedroom door I never wanted to talk to them for very long. &#x201c;I just wish you&#x2019;d get over this already,&#x201d; Hannah finally said one day, sitting on the edge of my bed. &#x201c;Yo...</p></p><h2>Joan Chittister: Essential Writings (Modern Spiritual Masters)</h2><p>Joan Chittister, a Benedictine nun, is one of the most popular and prophetic religious voices in the world today.

He looks up at her&#x2014;one half of his dark face burned underneath a mottled carpet of scars, scars he claims to have earned with a different story each time he tells it: lava, wampa, blaster fire, got blitzed on Corellian rum and fell down on a hot camping stove. &#x201c;Miss Susser&#x2014;&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Now that I&#x2019;m home, I&#x2019;m going by my married name again.

Above it: Two Star Destroyers hang there like swords above the surface. &#x201c;More important, you ain&#x2019;t the only cargo I&#x2019;m bringing in. I&#x2019;m finishing this job.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;They told us to turn around.

That&#x2019;s old thinking. &#x201c;The <i>New Republic. </i>They need to know.&#x201d; <br><br> A third Star Destroyer suddenly cuts through space, appearing in line with the others. <br><br> &#x201c;You got family down there?&#x201d;&nbsp;She offers a stiff nod. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d; <i>That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m home. <br><br></i> &#x201c;This was always a risk. The Empire&#x2019;s been here on Akiva for years. Not like <i>this, </i>but . . . they&#x2019;re here, and we&#x2019;re gonna have to deal with it.&#x201d; He leans in and says: &#x201c;You know why I call this ship the <i>Moth</i>?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;You ever try to catch a moth? Cup your hands, chase after it, catch it? White moth, brown moth, any moth at all? You can&#x2019;t do it. They always get away. Herky-jerky up-and-down left-and-right.

That&#x2019;s this ship.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t like it.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like it, either, but life is full of unlikable things. You wanna see your family again? Then we&#x2019;re doing this. Now&#x2019;s the time, too. Looks like they&#x2019;re just getting set up. Might could be more on the way.&#x201d; <br><br> A half-mad gleam in his one good eye. His other: an implacable red lens framed in an ill-fitting O-ring bolted to the scarred skin. He grins, then: crooked teeth stretched wide. He actually likes this. <br><br> <i>Smugglers, </i>she thinks.&nbsp;Well, she paid for the ticket. Time to take the ride. <br><br> The long black table gleams with light shining up from it&#x2014;a holo-graphic schematic of the <i>Vigilance</i>&#x2019;s docking bay and surrounding environs. It incorporates a fresh droid scan and shows damage to two of the TIE fighters, not to mention the bodies of the stormtroopers&#x2014; those left there as a reminder to others what can happen when you tussle with rebels. <br><br> The pilot of the Starhopper? Most definitely a rebel. Now the question: Was this an attack? Did he know they were here? Or is this some confluence of events, some crass coincidence that led to this intersection? <br><br> That, a problem for later. The problem now is figuring out just where he went. Because as she thought, the ship contained no body. <br><br> Best she can figure, he rigged the proton torpedoes to blow. Before they did, however, he . . . what? She taps a button, goes back to the Starhopper schematic she pulled off the Imperial databases. There. A stern-side door. Small, but enough to load small parcels of cargo in and out. <br><br> Her new pilot friend ducked out the back. Would&#x2019;ve been a considerable jump. <i>Jedi? </i>No. Couldn&#x2019;t be. Only one of those out there&#x2014;and zero chance the rebels would send their golden boy, Skywalker. <br><br> Back to the bay schematic&#x2014;&nbsp;<br><br> She spins it. Highlights the access ducts.&nbsp;<br><br> That&#x2019;s it. She pulls her comm. &#x201c;Tothwin. Our pilot is in the ducts. I&#x2019;ll bet all my credits you&#x2019;ll find an open vent&#x2014;&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;We have a problem.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> <i>The problem is that you interrupted me, </i>she thinks but does not say. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;We have a blockade-runner.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Another terrorist?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Could be. Looks like a bog-standard smuggler, though. Flying a small Corellian freighter&#x2014;an, ahh, let&#x2019;s see, an MK-4.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Dispatch the TIEs. Let them deal with it.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Of course, Admiral.&#x201d; <br><br> Everything feels like it&#x2019;s in slow motion. Norra sits, frozen in the navigator&#x2019;s chair next to Owerto Naiucho, the scar-faced smuggler&#x2014;flashes of light on his face, green light from the incoming lasers, orange light blooming from a TIE fighter meeting its untimely end. Outside, ahead of them, a swarm of TIEs like a cloud of insects&#x2014;the horrible scream as they pass, vibrating the chair beneath her and the console gripped in her white-knuckled hands. In the moments when she blinks, she doesn&#x2019;t see darkness. She sees another battle unfolding&#x2014; <br><br> <i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a trap!&#x201d; comes Ackbar&#x2019;s voice over the comm. The dread feeling as Imperial TIEs descend upon them like redjacket wasps from a rock- struck nest. The dark of space lighting up with a crackling beam of viridian light&#x2014;that coming from the half-constructed Death Star, just one more shovelful of dirt on the Alliance&#x2019;s grave as one of their own capital ships is gone, erased in a pulse of light, lightning, and fire&#x2014; <br><br></i> The freighter dives toward the planet&#x2019;s surface. Turning like a screw. The ship shuddering as laserfire scores its side. The shields won&#x2019;t hold forever. Owerto&#x2019;s yelling at her: &#x201c;You need to handle the guns! Norra! <i>The guns.</i>&#x201d; But she can&#x2019;t get up out of that chair. Her bloodless hands won&#x2019;t even leave the console. Her mouth is dry. Her underarms wet. Her heart is beating like a pulsar star before it goes dark. <br><br> <i>&#x201c;We want you to fly with us,&#x201d; Captain Antilles says. She objects, of course&#x2014;she&#x2019;s been working for the rebels for years now, since before the destruction of the first Death Star, but as a freighter pilot. Carrying message droids, or smuggling weapons, or just shuttling people from planet to planet and base to base. &#x201c;And that doesn&#x2019;t change the kind of pilot you are,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;You outran a Star Destroyer. You forced two TIE interceptors to crash into each other. You&#x2019;ve always been a great pilot. And we need you now for when General Solo gets those shield generators down.&#x201d; He asks her again: Is she in? Will she fly with the red and the gold? Yes. She says yes. Because of course she does&#x2014;how could she say otherwise? <br><br></i> Everything, gone dizzy. Lights inside the cabin flashing. A rain of sparks from somewhere behind their chairs. Here in the <i>Moth, </i>everything feels balanced on the head of a pin. Through the glass, the planet. The clouds, coming closer. TIE fighters punching holes through them, vapor swirling behind them. She stands up, hands shaking. <br><br> <i>Inside the bowels of the beast. Pipes and hissing steam. Skeletal beams and bundles of cord and conduit. The guts of the resurrected Death Star. The shields are down. This is their one chance. But the TIE fighters are everywhere. Coming up behind them, hawks nipping at their tail feathers. She knows where this goes: It means she&#x2019;s going to die. But that&#x2019;s how things get done. Gold Leader comms in&#x2014;Lando&#x2019;s voice in her ear, and his Sullustan copilot&#x2019;s just behind it. They tell her what to do. And again she thinks: </i>This is it, this is how I die. <i>She accelerates her fighter. The heat signature of the core goes left. She pulls her Y-wing right&#x2014;and a handful of the TIEs break off and follow her deeper. Away from the </i>Millennium Falcon. <i>Away from the X-wings. Laserfire frying her engines. Popping the top off her astromech. Smoke filling the cabin. The smell of ozone&#x2014; <br><br></i> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a gunner,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a pilot.&#x201d; <br><br> Then she pulls Owerto out of his pilot&#x2019;s chair. He protests, but she gives him a look&#x2014;a look she&#x2019;s practiced, a look where her face hardens like cooling steel, the look of a raptor before it takes your eyes. The smuggler gives a barely perceptible nod, and it&#x2019;s good that he does. Because as soon as she&#x2019;s down in the chair and grabbing the stick and throttle, she sees a pair of TIE fighters coming up fast from the front&#x2014; <br><br> Her teeth clamp down so hard she thinks her jaw might break. Lasers like demon fire score the sky ahead, coming right for them. <br><br> She pulls back on the stick. The <i>Moth </i>ceases its dive toward the planet&#x2019;s surface&#x2014;the lasers just miss, passing under the hind end of the freighter, continuing on&#x2014; <br><br> <i>Boom. <br><br></i> They take out two of the TIE fighters that had been following close behind. And even as she continues hauling back on the stick, her stomach and heart trading places, the blood roaring in her ears, she loopty-loops the ship just in time to see the remaining two TIEs clip each other. Vertical wing panels smashing together, prying apart&#x2014; each of the short-range Imperial fighters suddenly spinning away, pirouetting wildly through space like a pair of Republic Day firecracker pinwheels. <br><br> &#x201c;We got more incoming!&#x201d; Owerto hollers from somewhere behind her&#x2014;and then she hears the gears of the <i>Moth</i>&#x2019;s twin cannons grinding as the turret spins into place and begins barking fire. <br><br> Clouds whip past.&nbsp;<br><br> The ship bangs and judders as it kicks a hole in the atmosphere. <br><br> <i>This is my home, </i>she thinks. Or was. She grew up on Akiva. More important, Norra then was like Norra now: She doesn&#x2019;t much care for people. She went off on her own a lot. Explored the wilds outside the capital city of Myrra&#x2014;the old temples, the cave systems, the rivers, the canyons. <br><br> She knows those places. Every switchback, every bend, every nook and cranny. Again she thinks, <i>This is my home, </i>and with that mantra set to repeat, she stills her shaking hands and banks hard to starboard, corkscrewing the ship as laserfire blasts past. <br><br> The planet&#x2019;s surface comes up fast. Too fast, but she tells herself that she knows what she&#x2019;s doing. Down there, the rise of lush hills and slick-faced cliffs give way to the Canyon of Akar&#x2014;a winding serpentine valley, and it&#x2019;s there she takes the <i>Moth. </i>Into the rain-forested channel. Drizzle speckling her view, streaking away. The wings of the freighter clip branches, tearing up a flurry of leaves as she jukes left and jerks right, making the <i>Moth </i>one helluva hard target to hit. <br><br> Laserfire sears the canopy ahead.&nbsp;<br><br> Then: a bank of fog.&nbsp;<br><br> She pushes down on the stick, takes the freighter even lower. Here, the canyon is tighter. Trees stretching out like selfish hands, thrust up from rocky outcroppings. Norra deliberately clips these&#x2014;again on the left, then on the right. The <i>Moth</i>&#x2019;s turrets belt out cannon fire and suddenly a TIE comes tumbling end-over-end like a flung boulder&#x2014; she has to bank the ship hard to dodge it. It smashes into a tree. A belching fireball. <br><br> The freighter shudders.&nbsp;<br><br> More sparks. The cabin goes dark. Owerto: &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve lost the turrets!&#x201d; <br><br> Norra thinks: <i>We don&#x2019;t need them.<br>&nbsp;</i><br> Because she knows what&#x2019;s coming. One of the oldest temple complexes&#x2014;abandoned, an artifact of architecture from a time long, long ago, when the Ahia-Ko people dwelled here still. But before that: a cascading waterfall, a silver churn of water leaping over a cliff &#x2019;s edge. A cliff they call the Witch&#x2019;s Finger for the way it looks like a bent and accusing digit. There&#x2019;s a space underneath that bridge of stone, a narrow channel. <i>Too narrow, </i>she thinks. But maybe not. Especially not with the turret gone. Too late to do differently now&#x2014; <br><br> She turns the freighter to its side&#x2014; <br><br> Ahead, the gap under the rock. Waterfall on one side. Jagged cliff face on the other. Norra stills her breathing. Opens her eyes wide. <br><br> That mantra comes one last time, spoken aloud:&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;This is my home.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> The freighter passes through the channel.&nbsp;<br><br> It shakes like an old drunk&#x2014;what&#x2019;s left of the turret shears off. Clangs away, spinning into the waterfall spray&#x2014; <br><br> But they&#x2019;re out. Clean. Alive.&nbsp;<br><br> On the console, two blinking red blips.&nbsp;<br><br> TIE fighters. Behind them. <br><br> <i>Wait for it.<br>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Wait . . . for it . . .<br>&nbsp;</i><br> The air claps with a pair of explosions.&nbsp;<br><br> The two blips flicker and are gone.&nbsp;<br><br> Owerto hoots and claps his hands. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re clear!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> <i>Damn right we are.<br>&nbsp;</i><br> She turns the freighter and sets a course for the outskirts of Myrra.</p><h2>The Roman History: The Reign of Augustus (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Following Rome's long road to peace after decades of civil war, Cassius Dio provides the fullest account of the reign of the first emperor in Books 50 through 60 of his&nbsp;<i>Roman History</i>.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Despite this, Hardy has remained Holiday&#x2019;s attorney and confidant, and when Holiday is suspected of murder, Hardy and Glitsky find ample reason to question Holiday&#x2019;s guilt.&nbsp;<br><br>But Hardy&#x2019;s case falls on hostile ears, and to avoid arrest, Holiday turns fugitive. The police now believe three things: that Hardy is a liar protecting Holiday, that Holiday is a cold-blooded killer, and that Glitsky is a bad cop on the wrong side of the law.<br><br>As the suspense reaches fever pitch, Hardy, Glitsky, and even their families may be caught in the crossfire and directly threatened&#x2014;and this time, the police won&#x2019;t be on their side.</p><p>One of mystery fiction's most enduring and affecting male buddy teams--San Francisco defense attorney Dismas Hardy and police lieutenant Abe Glitsky--are back in Lescroart's newest thriller. Glitsky's been kicked upstairs (or sideways) to a desk job and warned off his usual homicide beat even though it's his father's best friend who's been murdered in a robbery-slaying, and it's Hardy's pal and client, John Holiday, who's been targeted as the killer. When two more killings follow, no one in the department believes that Hardy's client was set up. They don't believe Abe, either--the harder he tries to get at the truth, the more his ex-colleagues are convinced that he's a rogue cop who wants his old job back and will stoop to anything to get it. They got that idea from the well-bribed police brass who are protecting the real killers from prosecution and putting Abe and Dismas's nearest and dearest in their cross-hairs, too. But that's not quite enough to call our heroes off the case, even though the talented author manages to maintain the tension and ratchet up the suspense long enough to make the reader wonder. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>John Lescroart </b>is the author of nineteen previous novels, including <i>The Betrayal, The Suspect, The Hunt Club, The Motive, The Second Chair, The First Law, The Oath, The Hearing</i>, and <i>Nothing But the Truth</i>.

Overnight, these women were transformed from military spouses into American royalty. They had tea with Jackie Kennedy, appeared on the cover of <i>Life</i> magazine, and quickly grew into fashion icons.<br><br>Annie Glenn, with her picture-perfect marriage, was the envy of the other wives; JFK made it clear that platinum-blonde Rene Carpenter was his favorite; and licensed pilot Trudy Cooper arrived with a secret that needed to stay hidden from NASA. Together with the other wives they formed the Astronaut Wives Club, providing one another with support and friendship, coffee and cocktails.<br><br>As their celebrity rose-and as divorce and tragedy began to touch their lives-the wives continued to rally together, forming bonds that would withstand the test of time, and they have stayed friends for over half a century.

Divorce lawyer Alexia "Alex" Lindale finds herself doubling as a criminal defense attorney for Rena Richardson, a perfidious client who keeps changing her story about how her wealthy husband came to fall from a cliff. Meanwhile, the husband begins to emerge from his coma due to the healing power of prayer and music&#x2014;a recovery that terrifies Rena, who fears that he will soon be able to tell the truth about his accident. The novel offers a well-honed subplot about Alex's growing Christian faith and her attraction to the pianist who first introduced her to God, as well as interesting courtroom drama and lovely ruminations on music and nature. However, the plot threads aren't as tight or the twists as surprising as readers have come to expect from the Christy-winning Whitlow, and the ending fizzles. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Rose Wilder Lane tells of their struggle to survive with such force that <i>Free Land</i> has become a classic frontier novel. The young couple experience cyclones, droughts, and blizzards that isolate them for days in their sod shanty and endanger their livestock. The simple pleasures of home cooking, horse trading, and socializing interrupt work, here described in its wealth of variety. In every detail, <i>Free Land</i> comes to life because Lane grew up in the time and place of which she writes. The book embodies her belief that "living is never easy, that all human history is a record of achievement in disaster, and that our great asset is the valor of the American spirit." <p>Like the Beatons of this novel, Rose Wilder Lane's parents homesteaded in Dakota.

This book is invaluable gay history.&#34; -Inches MagazineBorn in New York City&#39;s black ghetto Harlem at the start of World War II, Samuel R. Delany married white poet Marilyn Hacker right out of high school. The interracial couple moved into the city&#39;s new bohemian quarter, the Lower East Side, in summer 1961. Through the decade&#39;s opening years, new art, new sexual practices, new music, and new political awareness burgeoned among the crowded streets and cheap railroad apartments. Beautifully, vividly, insightfully, Delany calls up this era of exploration and adventure as he details his development as a black gay writer in an open marriage, with tertiary walk-ons by Bob Dylan, Stokely Carmichael, W. H. Auden, and James Baldwin, and a panoply of brilliantly drawn secondary characters.Winner of the 1989 Hugo Award for Non-fictionSamuel R.

Alan Culpepper considers both the Gospel and the Letters of John. The book begins with a close look at the relationship between John and the Synoptics and a summary of John&#39;s distinctive thought and language. The second chapter addresses the fascinating issues regarding the origins of the Gospel and the letters: authorship, sources, and composition. The history of the Johannine community is reviewed in chapter three. Chapter four interprets the plot of the Gospel and prepares the student to read John as literature by providing a brief orientation to narrative criticism. The fifth chapter turns to more traditional concerns: John as theology. This chapter provides a digest of the Christology, theology, and eschatology of John. The sixth through the eighth chapters, the heart of the book, guide the student through a reading of the Gospel. The ninth chapter serves as an introduction to the Letters, noting especially their relationship to the Gospel. Each letter is treated in turn. The final chapter examines the challenges and potential of the Johannine literature as documents of faith. &#34;In previous writings Alan Culpepper has shown himself to be one of the best Johannine scholars of our time. He not only conveniently draws together his research but also shows himself to be an excellent teacher&#34;. -Raymond E. Brown</p><p>R.

Adopted by the community, Kampol is soon being raised by figures like Chong the shopkeeper, who rents out calls on his telephone and goes into debt while extending his customers endless credit. Kampol also plays with local kids like Noi, whose shirt is so worn that it rips right in half, and the sweet, deceptively cute toddler Penporn.<br><br>Dueling flea markets, a search for a ten-baht coin lost in the sands of a beach, pet crickets that get eaten for dinner, bouncy ball fads in school, and loneliness so merciless that it kills a boy&#x2019;s appetite all combine into <i>Bright</i>, the first-ever novel by a Thai woman to appear in English translation. Duanwad Pimwana&#x2019;s urban, and at times gritty, vignettes are balanced with a folk-tale-like feel and a charmingly wry sense of humor. Together, these intensely concentrated, minimalist gems combine into an off-beat, highly satisfying coming-of-age story of a very memorable young boy and the age-old legends, practices, and personalities that raise him.</p><p>Pimjai Juklin, whose pen name is Duanwad Pimwana, won the S.E.A.

Across the villages and cities of Thailand, her characters exist in a state of constant anxiety, unable to fit in but having nowhere else to go." <b>&#x2015;Jeremy Tiang, author of <i>State of Emergency</i></b> <br><br> "<i>Bright</i> is an authentic portrait of a working class community in Thailand, written in a remarkably clean prose style and with profound compassion. Duanwad Pimwana&#x2019;s bittersweet novel reveals glimpses of the inner life of Thai culture in such an entertaining and jocular manner that one can&#x2019;t help but absorb its social realist ingredients with pleasure and ease. With Pimwana&#x2019;s contribution, contemporary Thai literature is stronger, and I believe that this wonderful translation of one of her best works will prove to be seminal for Thailand&#x2019;s place in the literary world." <b>&#x2015; Prabda Yoon, author of <i>Moving Parts</i> and <i>The Sad Part Was</i></b></p><h2>Lives Across Cultures: Cross-Cultural Human Development</h2><p><i>For courses in Cross-Cultural Development</i> <br>&nbsp;<b> <br>An interdisciplinary exploration of cross-cultural human development throughout the lifespan</b> <br> <i> <b>Lives Across Cultures: Cross-Cultural Human Developmen</b> <b>t</b> </i> focuses on cultural similarities and differences in human development throughout the world and across the lifespan, while emphasizing the links between theory, research, and practical applications.

Brown, here he does the same for the Easter seasons by commenting on the Gospels stories of the risen Christ. Many, including Brown himself, have written about historical issues in the difficult and very different resurrection narratives given us by the evangelists; but such technical problems are not of concern here. the stress is on how the treatment of the resurrection in an individual Gospel fits the theology and plan of that Gospel.Raymond E. Brown, S.S., (1928-1998) was the Auburn Distinguished Professor of Biblical Studies at Union Theological Seminary in New York City. He was author of some forty books on the Bible and past president of three of the most important biblical societies in the world. By appointment of two popes (Paul VI in 1972, John Paul II in 1996) Brown was a member of the Roman Pontifical Biblical Commission. <i>Time</i> magazine called him "probably the premier Catholic Scripture scholar of the U.S."</p><h2>The Story That Cannot Be Told</h2><p><b>A powerful middle grade debut that weaves together folklore and history to tell the story of a girl finding her voice and the strength to use it during the final months of the Communist regime in Romania in 1989.</b><br><br>Ileana has always collected stories. Some are about the past, before the leader of her country tore down her home to make room for his golden palace; back when families had enough food, and the hot water worked on more than just Saturday nights. Others are folktales like the one she was named for, which her father used to tell her at bedtime. But some stories can get you in trouble, like the dangerous one criticizing Romania&#x2019;s Communist government that Uncle Andrei published&#x2014;right before he went missing.<br> <br>Fearing for her safety, Ileana&#x2019;s parents send her to live with the grandparents she&#x2019;s never met, far from the prying eyes and ears of the secret police and their spies, who could be any of the neighbors. But danger is never far away. Now, to save her family and the village she&#x2019;s come to love, Ileana will have to tell the most important story of her life.</p><p>J.

They&#x2019;ve killed him,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>At the table, my mother set down her copy of <i>Femeia</i> magazine. She glanced at me before she stood, took Tata&#x2019;s hat from his head, pulled him toward their bedroom door, and shut it quietly behind them.<br> <br>It was mid-July in 1989, and the electricity in Bucharest was off more often than on. Our tower-block concrete apartment building baked us like cabbage rolls in a clay pot, so we always let in the breeze through the balcony doors. I had been sprawled out on the living-room floor beside my Great Tome, the warm air tugging at the pages of my stories. Now I laid my coloring pencil aside and stared, my heart thudding faster with each sound that came through the wall.<br> <br>The apartment was so small you could see it all at once: the balcony where we dried our clothes, the living room and kitchen stuffed together, the tiny bathroom, my parents&#x2019; bedroom, my bedroom. My mother liked to say&#x2014;when my father wasn&#x2019;t there to stop her&#x2014;that if we were again forced to move, they would squeeze our whole family into a closet. She missed the apartment we&#x2019;d had before, with the dining room and the pantry and the corner office that held her piano. I didn&#x2019;t remember it, since we&#x2019;d had to leave when I was a baby, but I knew my parents had only been able to keep what could be carried. I knew they&#x2019;d only been given a day.<br> <br>As I sat there, tense and listening, I couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking it would happen again&#x2014;that whatever had frightened my father would force us to pack up without warning and leave. I wondered how much worse things would get if we moved. When the Leader had torn down our first home to make room for the wide, gaping boulevard and the palace, he&#x2019;d stuck us, like everyone else, into horrible gray concrete buildings, stacked one after another, all the same. Sometimes I would imagine my family&#x2019;s life before then: our pantry stocked full of bread and jam, my father&#x2019;s books lining the walls from ceiling to floor. In my memory of a place that I didn&#x2019;t remember, we always had enough food, and the hot water worked on more than just Saturday nights. We could bathe whenever we wanted, even in winter when the central heating went out.<br> <br>But I collected stories, both made-up and true.<br> <br>And I was usually good at spotting the difference.<br> <br>My family had never had enough food. We&#x2019;d never had enough hot water, enough space, enough light. At ten years old, I could already see how everyone, even me, talked about <i>before</i> in a special kind of voice and with special kinds of words. If we believed that <i>before</i>, things were better, we could imagine they&#x2019;d be better again. This was the way we survived.<br> <br>There was a loud thump behind my parents&#x2019; bedroom door, something striking their dresser. I jumped when it happened again. Muffled sounds came in great, rolling waves: my father&#x2019;s words rising, my mother suppressing the swell. I knew she didn&#x2019;t quiet him because of me, not really. She did it for the neighbor whose ear might be pressed to the wall, for the passerby in the corridor who might pause, fingers feeling in pockets for a pen. It was always best to assume someone was listening.<br> <br>When the door finally opened, I knew I must have looked frightened, so I pretended to be busy writing in my Great Tome. I was working on &#x201c;The Baker&#x2019;s Boy,&#x201d; a retelling of a parable from school, but my eyes couldn&#x2019;t focus on the words. I kept glancing up at my parents, who had settled into silent preparation for dinner. I tried not to think about who might have been killed, distracting myself by drawing loaves of tan-colored bread around the edge of my title page. But when the sun dipped low, its fading light turned all the Great Tome&#x2019;s colors to ugly shades of gray, so I tucked the book under my arm and carried it to the couch.<br> <br>With the power still out, the TV screen was just a dark reflection of me holding my stories, but I sat down and stared at it anyway. Thinking about the movies I loved made me feel a bit better, even if I knew there was no chance I&#x2019;d see them. We used to get two channels that had shows all day long. My mother still talked about when they&#x2019;d aired the one from America with the man in the cowboy hat, which always ended with somebody shot or in a car that exploded. But now we only had one channel, just two hours a day during the week, and it didn&#x2019;t air shows like that anymore. The programming was usually boring: speeches given from inside the grand palace; televised sessions of the Communist Party, the little men on the screen all cheering together, booing together, raising their fists; broadcasts that reviewed the state guidelines on &#x201c;rational eating&#x201d; or politely reminded viewers of local curfews.<br> <br>On Sundays, though, <i>Gala Animation</i> would come on, and we&#x2019;d get five whole minutes of a cartoon. Everyone I knew who had a television made sure not to miss it. Last summer, over the course of several weeks, I&#x2019;d caught all of <i>101 Dalmatians</i> and bragged to the other children when we went back to school. This summer they were showing <i>The Aristocats</i>, and the last episode had left the poor kitties scared and alone out in the country. I wouldn&#x2019;t get to see the next five minutes till the weekend, but if the power came back tonight, our handmade antenna might pick up something good from Bulgaria, and my whole family might sit down to watch. Then, just like always, we could leave behind whatever horrible thing had happened.<br> <br>Luck seemed to be on my side, at least for the moment, because as we were setting the table, the electricity flickered to life. I asked my father, &#x201c;Can I turn on the fan?&#x201d;<br> <br>Sometimes he said no. The taxes were very high if we went over our energy allotment. But tonight he didn&#x2019;t even look at me. He just gave a little gesture with his hand, which I took for a yes, then sat down in his place. The lines around his eyes and behind his big glasses looked deeper than usual, and I began to worry he might really be sick. At the table, the wind blowing through my choppy brown hair, I turned my gaze down and picked at my food. Pie with eggplant and potato but no meat. The queue had been too long at the butcher&#x2019;s. When the line manager had told me and my mother that it would take five hours, maybe six, to get our rations, I thought she&#x2019;d make us take turns waiting, but instead we&#x2019;d simply gone home.<br> <br>Nibbling a stale piece of bread and avoiding as much eggplant as possible, I did my best not to complain. My father was still quiet. The sickly look had not left his face, and I kept glancing up, wanting someone to speak. I knew they wouldn&#x2019;t tell me who was killed or why, because they&#x2019;d never told me before, but the longer everyone went without talking, the more anxious I grew, thinking that this time it had been someone important.<br> <br>When I could no longer take it, I did what I always did with silence. I tried to fill it with a story.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you want to hear the new one?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe another night,&#x201d; my mother replied.<br> <br>My stomach fluttered. My cheeks flushed. They never said no.<br> <br>I returned to poking at my dinner, suddenly frightened as I tried to guess who was dead, because it had never been this bad. It had never meant this much.<br> <br>My father put down his fork. &#x201c;Is that what you did today? Work on your stories?&#x201d;<br> <br>I thought he was mad about me not doing my summer homework, so I said quickly, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a school story. Mrs. Dumitru told it to us before vacation.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Another night,&#x201d; my mother repeated, and this time I took her words for what they were&#x2014;a warning.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I want to hear it. I want to hear what they&#x2019;re telling my daughter. I want to hear what she&#x2019;s writing.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked between them, shrinking into my chair. A chime from the clock let me ask, &#x201c;Can I be done?&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother glanced at my plate with a frown but nodded. &#x201c;Bring in your dishes. And turn off that fan. You&#x2019;ll catch cold.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about your story?&#x201d; my father asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I forgot it&#x2019;s not ready,&#x201d; I lied.<br> <br>After filling the sink with soapy water, I switched on the TV and sank down into the worn couch. My parents began to clean up. When the dark screen filled with static, I peeked out onto the balcony, worried that someone had climbed up and stolen our wires, but everything seemed okay. I looked at Mama. I hesitated. She was elbow deep in dirty dishes, my father helping dry. They were both still silent&#x2014;a bad sign.<br> <br>Usually, after supper, I had to turn up the TV extra loud because my mother loved to sing and my father loved to join in and bellow off-key. If it wasn&#x2019;t that cacophony, they would at least be chattering away about work.<br> <br>Back in the old apartment, my mother had given music lessons from home. But once she&#x2019;d lost her piano, she&#x2019;d had to take a job as a secretary. Now she filed stacks of papers and made calls and typed up copies of documents, since copy machines were illegal. Sometimes there was so much work, she had to get special permission to take a typewriter home.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have the worst job in the world,&#x201d; she would say.<br> <br>&#x201c;At least it&#x2019;s safe,&#x201d; my father would answer.<br> <br>Tata was a professor at the University of Bucharest, where he lectured in literature and composition. He&#x2019;d never been a very good writer, but he loved stories almost as much as I did, so he&#x2019;d spent his whole life learning how to listen to them. He could hear what was inside a story&#x2019;s heart&#x2014;what made it beat or let it die&#x2014;and he&#x2019;d shared that gift with me. Most nights after supper, if he wasn&#x2019;t singing with Mama or talking away, he&#x2019;d patiently critique all my new ideas. And if we couldn&#x2019;t watch television because the power was out, he&#x2019;d get a candle and I&#x2019;d go find his reading glasses and we&#x2019;d snuggle up on the couch with our books.<br> <br>Usually, after supper, our family found something to be happy about, even in the hardest of times. But tonight my father was silent and slouched like an old man&#x2014;like he was carrying a sack of stones on his shoulders&#x2014;and even though the kitchen was so close I could almost reach out and touch him, I felt as if he were standing a hundred kilometers away.<br> <br>Whatever was eating him up started eating me, too.<br> <br>I crawled over to the TV and twisted the knob frantically, searching for a Bulgarian station. We didn&#x2019;t speak Bulgarian, but they got much better shows, and sometimes when <i>Columbo</i> came on my father would pretend he knew what everyone was saying, making up silly things till we were all a giggling mess. If that happened tonight, life would go back to normal, I was sure, and whoever had died wouldn&#x2019;t matter, not really, just like they&#x2019;d never mattered before.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mama, the TV&#x2019;s all fleas,&#x201d; I called, getting desperate.<br> <br>My mother glanced at the clock. &#x201c;Then watch the news.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mama, <i>please</i>.&#x201d;<br> <br>She dried off her hands, sighing loudly, and stepped out onto the balcony to fiddle with the antenna. When she came back inside, there was still only static, so she changed the channel to the nightly state broadcast.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to watch a Bulgarian show!&#x201d; I said, panicking. Turning on the news was a terrible idea. Most of the time it just made my parents upset.<br> <br>When I kept complaining, Mama shushed me and gave a few gentle smacks to the back of my head. A newscaster was talking in front of black-and-white pictures of the Leader, an aging man with slick gray hair and puffy little boy&#x2019;s lips. His wife was beside him in a skirt suit and fat, shiny pearls. She was always photographed from the front so her nose would look small. The two stood before a huge crowd of people, giant posters of the Leader&#x2019;s face plastered all over the wall at their backs. The people were applauding. Flags were waving. I slid dramatically to the floor and rolled onto my stomach, groaning till my mother shook me to silence with her foot on my butt.<br> <br>A clip of the Leader must have started playing, because I heard him then, speaking to the cheering crowd about the importance of loyalty to the country, about the importance of poetry.<br> <br>&#x201c;Everyone enjoys a good love poem,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But of course the highest form of all art is socialist poetry.&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother sat down on the couch. She called to my father: <i>&#x201c;Lucian.&#x201d;</i><br> <br>He came over and I stopped fussing, lifting my face up from the thin carpet.<br> <br>The Leader read some lines from a poem. I knew the poet they were from. We all learned about him in school. This particular poem praised the state and the Communist Party.<br> <br>But I knew other poems from this poet, as well&#x2014;ones the teachers did not read in class.<br> <br>I knew them because the poet had gone to university with my uncle Andrei, my father&#x2019;s brother. The poet had written many things that he shouldn&#x2019;t have written, many things that did not praise our country. And before he died&#x2014;before his spine was crushed late one night under the wheels of a tram&#x2014;he had inspired my uncle to write poetry too.<br> <br>I tensed and looked up at my father.<br> <br>&#x201c;What wonderful lyrics,&#x201d; the newscaster said with a smile when the clip ended. &#x201c;Our writers must always strive for such beauty.&#x201d;<br> <br>My tata&#x2019;s face drained of what little color was left. When he started to sob, my whole body went numb. I thought I might start crying too, but before I could, my mother got up and ushered me into my room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. He&#x2019;s just not feeling well,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>But I collected stories, so I knew that was a lie.<br> <br>I knew my uncle, the poet, had not been home in a week. I knew now that my father thought he was dead.<br> <br>But recognizing a lie and knowing the truth are two different things.<br> <br>My father wasn&#x2019;t crying just because he was afraid for his brother&#x2014;his brother who wrote dangerous poems.<br> <br>He was also afraid for me.<br></p><h2>Sophocles, Volume II. Antigone. The Women of Trachis. Philoctetes. Oedipus at Colonus (Loeb Classical Library No. 21)</h2><p><p>Sophocles (497/6&#x2013;406 BCE), with Aeschylus and Euripides, was one of the three great tragic poets of Athens, and is considered one of the world's greatest poets. The subjects of his plays were drawn from mythology and legend. Each play contains at least one heroic figure, a character whose strength, courage, or intelligence exceeds the human norm&#x2014;but who also has more than ordinary pride and self-assurance. These qualities combine to lead to a tragic end.</p><p>Hugh Lloyd-Jones gives us, in two volumes, a new translation of the seven surviving plays. Volume I contains <i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i> (which tells the famous Oedipus story), <i>Ajax</i> (a heroic tragedy of wounded self-esteem), and <i>Electra</i> (the story of siblings who seek revenge on their mother and her lover for killing their father). Volume II contains <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i> (the climax of the fallen hero's life), <i>Antigone</i> (a conflict between public authority and an individual woman's conscience), <i>The Women of Trachis</i> (a fatal attempt by Heracles' wife to regain her husband's love), and <i>Philoctetes</i> (Odysseus's intrigue to bring an unwilling hero to the Trojan War).</p><p>Of his other plays, only fragments remain; but from these much can be learned about Sophocles' language and dramatic art. The major fragments&#x2014;ranging in length from two lines to a very substantial portion of the satyr play <i>The Searchers</i>&#x2014;are collected in Volume III of this edition. In prefatory notes Lloyd-Jones provides frameworks for the fragments of known plays.</p></p><p><p>Sir Hugh Lloyd-Jones (1922&#x2013;2009) was Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford University.</p>&#x201c;Sir Hugh is providing, that is, what Nabokov, in rendering <i>Eugene Onegin</i>, called a metaphrase--a scrupulous, bare explanation of the original...Plainspun prose indeed, but attractively diaphanous.

While writing `Public Enemies' I kept it on my desk at all times. I daresay one cannot call himself a real Minnesotan if you haven't read it. The book is just that darned good."&#x2014;Bryan Burrough, author of Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and Birth of the FBI, 1933-34, the basis for Public Enemies, the movie starring Johnny Depp<br><br>This book is based on more than 100,000 pages of FBI files and wiretaps, prison and police records, and mob confessions. Interviews with 250 crime victims, policemen, gun molls, and family members of criminals bring these public enemies to life. Crime historian Paul Maccabee takes you inside the bank robberies, gangland assassinations, and police intrigue of St. Paul's 1920s and1930s gangster era. You'll also find Crooks' Tour maps and more than 130 rare FBI, police, and family photographs.<br>Praise for John Dillinger Slept Here:<br>"A landmark study of gangland crime."&#x2014;William J. Helmer, author of Dillinger: The Untold Story<br>"Maccabee is an authority on his subject which makes John Dillinger Slept Here an enthralling read. " &#x2014;St. Paul Pioneer Press</p><p>Paul MacCabeeCriminal Neglect: As of 1995, the FBI still is withholding the identity of a famous St. Paul kidnapping victim. This is, apparently, to protect the innocent. Except that in this case the kidnapping took place more than 60 years ago. The victim, banker Edward Bremer, has been dead for decades. Author Paul Maccabee hauls out a heavily censored Bremer document to support his oft-stated complaint that FBI officials remain stubbornly and unnecessarily secretive about gangster activities that occurred so long ago that there are no actual participants left to offend, defame or endanger. <p>Federal foot-dragging on the release of information is the main reason why Maccabee's new book "John Dillinger Slept Here," took 12 years to research and write, he says. "Promoting the book is the easy part. The hard part was dealing with the FBI. What surprised me the most about the Bureau is that even after J. Edgar Hoover died, there is still this cult of secrecy at the place." Nevertheless, his book, published by the Minnesota Historical Society Press, is all about St. Paul and the mobsters who had free run of the town in the 1920s and 1930s. That historic fact is no surprise; St. Paul's lurid past is increasingly celebrated in such novels as "Saint Mudd," such stage productions as "Last Hooch at Hollyhocks" and in gangster-era tours that are currently pitched at the public like casino outings. The era of which Maccabee writes, 1920 to 1936, is recent enough so that there are still many citizens around who remember rubbing elbows with big-named hoods at St. Paul's notorious blind pigs, or speakeasies. Some remember selling ice or soda pop to John Dillinger, or newspapers to Ma Barker. Many of the homes and apartment buildings where dramatic gunfights or getaways occurred are still standing, and the families of some of the innocent victims still mourn their losses. Much, of course, has already been written about Dillinger's days in St. Paul, and how he and Homer Van Meter evaded capture by shooting their way out of the Lincoln Court Apartments.</p><p> The Barker-Karpis gang, which specialized in bank robberies and kidnappings, pulled off some of the most daring, brutal and bloody capers in the Twin Cities, and much is known of how they holed up in the White Bear Lake area. "The bad guys have usually been portrayed in glamorous ways," Maccabee says, "and their molls are usually cleansed and adorable. But the fact is these were unhappy women who were battered, misused and diseased. They had money and big cars, but they were also the chief cooks and bottle washers for the gang. If they were lucky, their big night out was a movie, and when they had to leave town, they had to leave in a big hurry." "The guys they hung out with weren't perceived as threats to polite society, not like the drive-by shooters are today. But one fact remains: Those old gangsters did kill innocent people. It is a myth that all the good people of the city were shocked when the Bremer and Hamm kidnappings occurred. The reality is that the lines between clean society and the gangsters had been intertwined for years. Someone had to make all that bootleg liquor, and someone had to spend money at the speakeasies." Maccabee's book gives fresh detail about corruption in the police department, and how the biggest leak in the department was right in the chief's office. He writes of how Leon Gleckman-described as St. Paul's Al Capone-ran the city from the third floor of the Lowry Hotel, and how one man-Daily News editor Howard Kahn-heroically battled the mob and fought for political reform in his front-page editorials. The most distressing news in Maccabee's book is that the St. Paul police department, as late as the 1980s, systematically destroyed many of the first-hand records of the era. This was not a sinister act, Maccabee says, but rather simple ignorance born out of need for more record storage space. "This book had to be written now," Maccabee says. "The files were literally being destroyed as I wrote. Ninety percent of the records of that era are gone. The cops had Homer Van Meter's hat, can you imaging that? And now it's gone." There are some artifacts of the times still left, though. Dapper Danny Hogan owned the infamous Green Lantern saloon and was unofficially the head of St. Paul's underworld until he was blown away one morning when he started his car. The police department still has pieces of the bomb, and they still have the gun that wounded Dillinger in the Lexington Court shootout . "I suppose it's understandable that much of the material, many of the souvenirs and artifacts, are missing," says Maccabee. "Most cities don't want to be reminded of their scoundrels." -- <i>Saint Paul Pioneer Press, September 4, 1995</i><br><br>Crook's Tour of Crime: For anyone who likes to read of the cops-and-robbers gangbuster era of the 1930s, John Dillinger Slept Here is a must read. The title is somewhat deceptive. The book, while it deals with Dillinger, is more a portrait of the times in which he lived, and particularly the city of St. Paul, Minn., which served as a haven for America's most wanted outlaws. It is subtitled A Crooks' Tour of Crime and Corruption in St. Paul, 1920-1936 and is a fascinating look into the gangster era of that time. Compiled by crime historian Paul Maccabee who spent 13 years researching FBI and police files, it details gangland crime in the 1920s and 1930s. The players include everyone from Dillinger to machine Gun Kelly, Alvin "Creepy" Karpis, Ma Barker, Babyface Nelson and many, many more. Diligent research: It is a delightfully written book, combining intimate insights into the people and events of the time bolstered by diligent research. Maccabee takes the reader along on bank robberies, gangland assassinations, kidnappings, the bloody battles between corrupt police and the FBI. The book is based on FBI files, wiretaps, prison and police records, confessions and interviews with 250 crime victims, police officers, gun molls and family members. He brings notorious public enemies to life with touches of humor, pathos and intimate details. A Dillinger moll, describing the times, laments, "It wasn't very exciting. All I did was cook and wash dishes..." Alvin Karpis says of his lawyers: "They got the money. I got the time." What Maccabee uncovers is how gangland ruled St. Paul with full cooperation of the police for nearly two decades. In fact, John J. "the Big Fellow" O'Conner, who served as St. Paul police chief almost continually from 1900 to 1920, supervised the underworld from police headquarters. He left a legacy of bribery, corrupt judges, fencing operations for stolen property and protection of outlaws that set the foundation for St. Paul as "outlaw city" for the likes of Dillinger and Karpis for years to come. It was a place of corrupt politicians, brothels, bootleggers, kidnappers, robbers, murderers and thieves, all perfectly safe as long as they committed no crime within the city limits of St. Paul, a virtual paradise of illicit nightclubs, casinos and posh hotels that flourished through the years of Prohibition. Picture them: some 135 illustrations of people and places add an enticing ambiance to the story: photos of Ma Barker; Frances Nash (a school teacher) wife of bank robber Frank Nash; Edna "the kissing bandit" Murray; Delores Delany, girlfriend of Alvin Karpis; Evelyn "Billie" Frechette, girlfriend of John Dillinger; and Lester M. Gillis--aliases: George Nelson, "Baby Face" Nelson, Alex Gillis, Lester Giles, "Big George" Nelson, "Jimmie" and "Jimmy" Williams --to name a few. Perhaps most interesting is the intimate look at famous "gang leader" Ma Barker. Born Arizona Clark near Springfield, MO., she came to be labeled "the red hot momma and brains" of the Barker gang by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. This, however, was how Alvin Karpis referred to Ma: "Just an old-fashioned home-body from the Ozarks. . . superstitious, gullible, simple, cantankerous and, well, generally law-abiding." The gang, he said, took Ma along with them because nobody suspected them of being crooks with this little old lady in their midst. According to Karpis, "Ma couldn't organize breakfast," but Hoover was later to preen before the press that she was "a mastermind of crime" after agents machine-gunned her down during a siege of the gang's Florida hide-away. Hoover does not emerge as an endearing character. He was universally hated within his own organization as well as in the ranks of the underworld. Dillinger especially was a thorn in Hoover's side. Time after time, he eluded traps laid by FBI agents, and it was claimed Dillinger's capture became an obsession with Hoover, who, meanwhile, ignored the far more menacing figures of "the syndicate," "the mafia," and other organized-crime figures. Overall, Maccabee has written a delightful book in which "the good guys" are difficult to distinguish from the "bad guys" during an uproarious period of American history. A very engaging and readable book. -- <i>The Indianapolis Star, August 20, 1995</i><br><br>John Dillinger Slept Here (Minnesota Historical Society), by Paul Maccabee: this is a small masterpiece of social history that describes how an earlier "war on crime" provided Americans an entertaining distraction from their Depression worries-except in St. Paul, where enlightened civic policy maintained the peace far more simply by offering sanctuary to public enemies. -- <i>Playboy, May 1996</i><br><br>The crooks of St. Paul are captured in great style: Eighteenth-century novelist and preacher Laurence Sterne reputedly delivered something like the following line in a sermon to his congregation on the morning after his wedding: We have labored all the night to no good effect." St. Paul historian Paul Maccabee has labored way more than all the night-and to very excellent effect. Maccabee spent thirteen years, combed through 100,000 pages of formerly classified FBI documents, interviewed all manner of experts and survivors and read a ton of books in order to write John Dillinger Slept Here: A Crooks' Tour of Crime and Corruption in St. Paul, 1920-1936 (Minnesota Historical Society Press, 360 pages, $45 cloth, $24.95 paper). Since I moved to town 25 years ago, I've heard stories and read newspaper accounts about the deal struck between the St. Paul police and the petty and not-so-petty hoodlums of the 1920s and 1930s; Gangsters such as John Dillinger, Alvin Karpis and Ma Barker were welcome to stop over in St. Paul, as long as they committed their crimes elsewhere. Maccabee, in a monumental effort of research, has fleshed out this story, told the smaller stories behind the story and profiled all the major and many of the minor players to create an altogether fetching story of crime and corruption in the Saintly City, including some side trips to its younger sister across the river, the town that isn't mentioned in the Bible. One thing I found out was that the high-profile Robin Hood gangsters, such as Dillinger, were just a part of the story. St. Paul and Minneapolis had their own criminals, often better organized and richer than the darlings of the tabloids. &gt;Dapper Dan Hogan, owner of St. Paul's Green Lantern saloon, who acted as go-between for Police Chief John O'Connor and the visiting indignitaries. (Hogan was blown through the roof of his automobile one day in 1928.) &gt;St. Paul bootlegging king, Leon Gleckman, who held court at the St. Paul Hotel. And his Minneapolis counterpart, Isadore (Kid Cann) Blumenfeld. (Gleckman went to the movies with his wife every night because it was the only place he dared sleep.) &gt;St. Paul's leading madam, Nina Clifford, who operated a fancy whorehouse on Washington St., just below the central police station. (On her building permit was the description "dwelling place," to which some wag at City Hall added "and seminary.") Maccabee takes some well-deserved swipes at the FBI, points out egregious anti-Semitism in all the law enforcement ranks (many of the "Syndicate" mobsters were Jewish) and admirably refuses to glamorize any of the punks who lived in or descended on our fair cities. Some may object that the book is organized in snippets rather than chronologically, a practice which breeds repetition, but no one will argue with the efficacy of 135 photographs, six maps, the chronological survey and the gazetteer of "Rogues and Reformers." If I were to read the book again, I'd Xerox the vast footnotes at book's end and have them by my side for easy reference, just so I could more fully admire Maccabee's research. -- <i>Star Tribune, September 3, 1995</i><br><br>Two of the more historically interesting books I've seen lately-one rather macabre, the other totally absorbing-were sent to me by The Historical Society of Minnesota, a publisher I had not heard too much about prior to this. The books are limited to activities in just one state-Minnesota in the 1930s. The first is John Dillinger Slept Here by Paul Maccabee, and sub-titled A Crooks' Tour of Crime and Corruption in St. Paul from 1920 to 1936. But first, the story of the bootleggers, kidnappers, murderers and thieves-and the police-who "used" Minneapolis and St. Paul, the Twin Cities, and Minnesota in general, as a playground. It was also the sight of many major kidnappings and bank holdups which occurred during those wild and wooly 1930s of The Great Depression and Prohibition eras. Their names still fascinate in print, and on the late show from the Warner Bros. Gangster era films and other studios: Baby Face Nelson, John Dillinger, Roger "The Terrible" Touhy, Machine Gun Kelly, Alvin "Creepy" Karpis, and who could ever forget Ma Barker-Bloody Mama, as portrayed by Shelley Winters in that violent 1970 film depicting Ma Barker's life. Maccabee spent 13 years researching and gathering material for this fascinating account of Minnesota and its "baddies" of the era. He leads you to nearly 70 of the Twin Cities' most notorious Prohibition speakeasies, gambling dens, the gangland hideouts, brothels and "Murder, Inc." killing sites. (The latter was also portrayed on film in Murder, Incorporated.) It is obvious there has always been a morbid interest in America's violent past, but none so detailed as Maccabee's effort. Through the words of eyewitnesses, FBI agents and the remaining gangsters themselves, the author takes you inside the bank robberies, gangland assassinations and the (corrupt) police intrigue of the Twin Cities of the 1920s and 1930s. The book also reveals for the first time the secrets of J. Edgar Hoover's feud with "Creepy" Karpis, the love story behind the bloody Kansas City Massacre and the battle between corrupt cops and the FBI. Maccabee waded through 100,000 pages of FBI files, wiretap transcripts, prison and police records and many mob "confessions." There are interviews with 250 crime victims, policemen, "gun molls," and surviving family members. There are also "Crook's Tour" maps and more than 130 rare FBI, police and family photographs and other sources. This book is, literally, a landmark examination of how gangsters of that era virtually held a major American city hostage with police cooperation for two decades. This book is a very provocative tale of corruption and is exceedingly well told and well worth reading. In cities like Chicago, mobsters such as Capone controlled the police. In St. Paul, police controlled the mobsters. All in all, it is a fascinating, engrossing story of a rogue's gallery of criminals-police of the era and otherwise.

But as Rucker C. Johnson demonstrates in <i>Children of the Dream</i>, it was, in fact, a spectacular achievement. Drawing on longitudinal studies going back to the 1960s, he shows that students who attended integrated and well-funded schools were more successful in life than those who did not -- and this held true for children of all races.<br> Yet as a society we have given up on integration. Since the high point of integration in 1988, we have regressed and segregation again prevails. Contending that integrated, well-funded schools are the primary engine of social mobility, <i>Children of the Dream</i> offers a radical new take on social policy. It is essential reading in our divided times. <br></p><p><b>Rucker C. Johnson</b> is the Chancellor's Professor in the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and a faculty research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He lives in Oakland, California"If you long for compelling arguments to reinforce a commitment to equal opportunity, <i>Children of the Dream</i> is a must-read. This well-written book integrates analyses of original quantitative data sets with engaging discussions of eye-opening qualitative evidence to reveal in sharp relief why the combination of integrated education, quality preschools, and equitable school funding works for disadvantaged students. Rucker C. Johnson has written an important volume that is bound to not only engage academics and policymakers, but general readers as well."&#x2015;<b>William Julius Wilson, Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor, Harvard University</b><br><br>"This book is fuel for hope. No other work addressing race so powerfully combines first-class social science with historical, social, and policy analysis. Passion shapes the narrative without compromising the science. Indeed, here is a model for how to advocate equity by being advocates for evidence rather than ideology. <i>Children of the Dream</i> joins Richard Rothstein's recent work as essential reading for anyone committed to understanding our racial divisions and then addressing them with public policies and moral courage."&#x2015;<b>Christopher Edley, professor and former dean, U.C. Berkeley Law School, and co-founder, The Opportunity Institute</b><br><br>"There is no more urgent issue in America today than closing the gaps between Americans of different races and ensuring that everyone has a decent life and living. Education is central to that aspiration. This book is a bracing and informative summary of the history of segregation, desegregation, and resegregation. It demonstrates that integration works and that it is a goal towards which our entire society should work."&#x2015;<b>Diane Ravitch</b>, <b><i><b>author of <i>The Death and Life of the Great American School System</i></b></i></b><br><br>"In a highly diverse society and world like ours, integration matters. Most of us learn to live integrated lives through integrated schools. Rucker C. Johnson's ground-breaking research should raise alarms for policy makers, educators, parents, and any other citizen concerned about America's future in the face of classrooms that look today as segregated as they were when that practice was declared unlawful in 1954."&#x2015;<b>Deval Patrick, Managing Director, Bain Capital Double Impact, former Governor of Massachusetts</b></p><h2>What Is To Be Done?</h2><p><p>This is Lenin&#x2019;s seminal text on social revolution and how to achieve it, published some 16 years before Russia&#x2019;s October 1917 Revolution.&nbsp; His plan to overturn the Czar&#x2019;s ruthless autocratic regime proposes the establishment of a cadre of &#x201c;professional revolutionaries&#x201d; with the necessary skills and experience to counter the regime&#x2019;s secret police.&nbsp;</p><p>Lenin derides trade unionists as &#x201c;wretched amateurs&#x201d;, arguing that a struggle for simple economic betterment is not enough, nor are patchwork reforms &#x2013; what is needed is the complete overthrow of the political system.&nbsp; Lenin&#x2019;s &#x201c;professional revolutionaries&#x201d; are not so much &#x2018;shock troops&#x2019; of violent rebellion as educated activists who will awaken the workers&#x2019; class consciousness, leading them to reject western-style political factions and to work within the Party to achieve the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p><p>Essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the October Revolution and the ensuing upheavals of the twentieth century.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Bourbon King: The Life and Crimes of George Remus, Prohibition&#39;s Evil Genius</h2><p><p><strong>On the 100th anniversary of The Volstead Act comes the epic, definitive story of the man who cracked the Prohibition system, became one of the world&#x2019;s richest criminal masterminds, and helped inspire&nbsp;<em>The Great Gatsby.</em></strong><br> Love, murder, political intrigue, mountains of cash, and rivers of bourbon . . . The tale of George Remus is a grand spectacle and a lens into the dark heart of Prohibition. Yes, Congress gave teeth to Prohibition in October 1919, but the law didn&#x2019;t stop George Remus from amassing a fortune that would be worth billions of dollars today. As one Jazz Age journalist put it, &#x201c;Remus was to bootlegging what Rockefeller was to oil.&#x201d;<br><br> Author Bob Batchelor breathes life into the largest bootlegging operation in America&#x2014;greater than that of Al Capone&#x2014;and a man considered the best criminal defense lawyer of his era. Remus bought an empire of distilleries on Kentucky&#x2019;s &#x201c;Bourbon Trail&#x201d; and used his other profession, as a pharmacist, to profit off legal loopholes. He spent millions bribing officials in the Harding Administration, and he created a roaring lifestyle that epitomized the Jazz Age over which he ruled.<br><br> That is, before he came crashing down in one of the most sensational murder cases in American history: a cheating wife, the G-man who seduced her and put Remus in jail, and the plunder of a Bourbon Empire. Remus murdered his wife in cold-blood and then shocked a nation winning his freedom based on a condition he invented&#x2014;temporary maniacal insanity.</p></p><p>Bob Batchelor is a critically acclaimed, bestselling cultural historian and biographer.

Money and mayhem! Murder in broad daylight! The trial of the century! With <i>The Bourbon King,</i> Bob Batchelor brings us a story that seems ripped from the tabloids, except it all happens to be true.

He resides in Northern Virginia.</p>In the Beginning<br>Genesis 1:1-31<br>Today as we begin our Bible study, we start with the book of Genesis. The first four books of the Bible are attributed to Moses, but scholars have discovered that there are different forms and traditions of these books: the Yahwehist tradition, the Eloist tradition, the Deuteronomist tradition. Men of different times added and at times repeated things. There are no myths in the Scripture, but there are stories and legends. In order to reveal to finite minds something of the beauty of God and creation, we now have a written account--but we must remember as we read this that the Word was passed on orally for many, many centuries. Some think that Scripture is as old as creation. Moses merely wrote what had been passed down for generations, thousands of years perhaps--who knows. For the sake of future generations, Moses began to put down in writing the marvels that God had worked. So we have the book of Genesis. In the beginning_._._._(1:1).<br><br>Now when you read Scripture, you must first of all read it as a prayer. It is more than a historical document. It is revelation. We as finite creatures have no concept of God, His love, His mercy, or His forgiveness. This book is a revelation of how much God loves you. You must read it slowly, as a prayer, and you must read it with your imagination.<br><br>Never read Scripture unless you engage your mental faculties: your memory, your understanding, and your will. Now I want you to do this: as I read the Scripture and comment upon it I want you to picture the entire scene in your mind. And when you read Scripture alone, you must see a picture. You've got to use your mental faculties. The best way to read Scripture is to put yourself in that time. I keep telling you that to God all things are present, so that when you read In the beginning_._._._you are there. Why? Because you were present in the mind of God then! Very often today people say the Scriptures are not relevant. That is not true. Scripture is relevant every day: in the past and in the future. It is because you do not read Scripture properly that you cannot take the nitty-gritty of this day. You can't accept life with its heartaches and problems and mysteries--mysteries that can never be solved, only accepted. Scripture is not something you're going to understand fully. For all eternity we will contemplate and meditate on those first words of Genesis: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<br><br>You know, if you use your imagination you can hardly get past that one sentence. Can you imagine going back to a time when there was nothing, absolutely nothing? You cannot imagine nothing, because everything you've ever encountered is something.<br><br>The Scripture says: In the beginning_._._._You can just about feel the utter silence of nothing. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was a formless void, there was darkness over the deep, and God's Spirit hovered over the water (1:2). Isn't that a meditation? Can you imagine just for a moment--just block everything out of your mind for a moment--and put yourself in the past, at the beginning. That same Spirit that lives in you hovered over the water.<br><br>Then we like to imagine the voice of God, like thunder, coming out of nothingness and announcing: "Let there be light," and there was light (1:3). From nothing to light. And God saw that light was good, and God divided light from darkness (1:4). Scholars tell us that this might reference the creation of the angels. The angelic spirit world is pure spirit, pure light. Later on it speaks about the sun and the moon, and many have wondered why He would create the sun and the moon when He had already said, "Let there be light." God separated light from darkness, the good angels from the bad. I like to think of it that way--He created the magnificent spirit world of pure intelligence.<br>The Scripture says, God called light "day", and darkness he called "night". Evening and morning came: the first day (1:5). Now this may have taken millions of years.<br><br>There is nothing in Scripture against evolution, so long as you recognize that God is the Prime Mover. Although in my ignorant mind I've often wondered, "Why are there still apes around if we came from them?" Somewhere along the line if apes became man, wouldn't all the apes be men by now? It's just a question. Maybe it comes from not being too bright, but I'm happier this way._._._._And this "random selection" stuff is wacko. There is nothing random about the designs of God. But let's get back to Genesis.<br><br>So God said, "Let there be a vault in the waters to divide the waters in two." And so it was (1:6). God made the vault, and it divided the waters above the vault from the waters under the vault (1:7). God called the vault "heaven." Evening came and morning came: the second day (1:8).<br>Now some of our intellectual brethren will say to you, "You don't really believe that? From nothing comes nothing." Only God can create. Only God by a sheer act of His will can create. And whether that creation took one day or a billion days or a billion years, it doesn't matter. It is still the work of a Superior Being--God, creating out of nothing. As you read this you must realize that you were in God's mind when He created that vault and the waters under heaven. You want to read this book of Genesis with feeling. You want to read it with your imagination and with yourself present in the mind of God.<br><br>I am often accused of not being realistic, of having my mind in the heavens and never dealing with nitty-gritty living--but you know, this is real. To live knowing that I was in God's mind when He made that vault and the dry land, it makes this rat race world livable. This is real. God's creation is real.<br><br>God said, "Let there be lights in the vault of heaven to divide day from night (1:14),_._._._to shine on the earth." And so it was (1:15). God made the two great lights: the greater light to govern the day, the smaller light to govern the night, and the stars (1:16). God set them in the vault of heaven to shine on the earth (1:17), to govern the day and the night and to divide light from darkness. God saw that it was good (1:18). Evening came and morning came: the fourth day (1:19). I think it gives glory to God, because He is infinite, there is no limit to His power. You see, He created this little bitty thing and then, boom, He creates the whole thing.<br><br>This book of Genesis is so fantastic when you use your imagination a little bit. The Spirit in you should come in contact with the Spirit in this book so that you can understand something of the mystery within it. How does this relate to you? This is important. The creation of the world must relate to your life. For those of us who are not theologians, we who eat and drink and work, it isn't important how high Mount Sinai is or what they ate in the time of Abraham or what the land looked like. Those things are good information, but for you it is only important that you read Scripture with the mind of God, with great love and affection.<br><br>God said, "Let the earth produce every kind of living creature: cattle, reptiles, and every kind of wild beast (1:24)._._._._Let us make man in our own image, in the likeness of ourselves, and let them be masters of the fish of the sea, the birds of heaven, the cattle, all the wild beasts and all the reptiles that crawl upon the earth" (1:26)._._._._Male and female God created them. God blessed them, saying to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and conquer it" (1:27). This is important.<br><br>So many people think the original sin was sex--obviously not, because the Lord told them to "be fruitful and multiply." The forbidden fruit was pride, as it is today. Pride: "No one will tell me what to do." And God said, "See, I give you all the seed-bearing plants that are upon the whole earth, and all the trees with seed-bearing fruit; this shall be your food (1:29). To all wild beasts, all birds of heaven and all living reptiles on the earth I give all the foliage of plants for food." And so it was (1:30). God saw all he had made, and indeed it was very good. Evening came and morning came: the sixth day (1:31).<br><br>You know we have a lesson here: God created the world, He created Adam and Eve. He gave them the world to use; to feed them, to clothe them, to make them happy, to delight in, to walk with God in. They received preternatural gifts: to live without pain, without sorrow, without heartache. Imagine that. They were endowed with a deep intelligence. There was no death. The world could feed them till their fill without toil. These are things Adam and Eve had. We don't know how long they had them. So often in life we strive for things, we exert a lot of effort and work and sweat, and when we get those things, they turn to ashes. They're gone. Then you ask, "Why did I work so hard? What was I looking for?" Maybe Adam and Eve were that way. Maybe they got tired of the abundance of God's gifts. Being grateful for all He gives us is the better path.<br>The Fall<br>Genesis 3:1-12<br>Saint Padre Pio was once asked what he thought the greatest sin in the world was today. He said curiosity. I would have chosen at least three or four bigger ones, but he got to the root of everything. Look at how the devil deals with Adam and Eve. He comes as a serpent.<br><br>A lot of people today say, "Aw, that's kind of a story, serpents don't talk." Why do we like to split hairs like they did in seventeenth-century parlors? They used to discuss and fight over religious matters. So here comes the serpent (story or not, let's not split hairs; let's get to the point): It asked the woman, "Did God really say you were not to eat from any of the trees in the garden?" (3:1). The woman answered the serpent, "We may eat the fruit of the trees in the garden" (3:2). Now that was her first mistake: she opened her big mouth, which should teach us a lesson. Don't talk to the devil. Don't even answer him. She made her first mistake. She continued: "But of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God said, 'You must not eat it, nor touch it under pain of death' " (3:3). Then the Serpent said to the woman, "No! You will not die! (3:4). God knows in fact that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, knowing good and evil" (3:5).<br>Her second mistake was that she listened to the enemy. The first thing she did was to hear his voice and answer. The second problem was: she listened. The woman saw that the tree was good to eat and pleasing to the eye, and that it was desirable for the knowledge that it could give. So she took some of its fruit and ate it. She gave some also to her husband who was with her, and he ate it (1:6). Gullible!<br>The devil essentially asks Eve (and I'm paraphrasing), "Can you eat from that tree?"<br>She said, "Oh, no, we're not permitted to eat from that tree."<br>"Why?"<br>"Well, the Lord God said we couldn't."<br>"Oh, I know why He said that."<br>"Why?" (Here we go.)<br>"Because if you eat from it, you'll be like God. You'll know good from evil." (Whenever you read the word "know" in Scripture, it means "experience." It doesn't mean the acquisition of knowledge. It means experience.)<br>Eve says, "Really?"<br>"Oh yeah. You'll have something you never had before," the serpent says.<br>"Wow." (I'm ad-libbing a little bit here.)<br><br>Then perhaps he said, "You know, I think God's very unfair to forbid you from eating of that tree. It's beautiful to behold and it's in your garden. Doesn't make much sense that you can't eat from it." Something convinced her, and I can only imagine that her curiosity got the best of her. Then he would have said, "Well, go on, try it."<br><br>So there she is, crunching away. It must have tasted good. If it hadn't she would have thrown it down and said something like, "I can see why the Lord God told us not to eat from that one." But she didn't; it tasted very good and very different from any other fruit. Then I would think Adam comes along and probably yells at her: "What are you doing?"<br>And she said, "It's very good, and it isn't at all like the Lord God said it was."<br>"Really?"<br>"No." See the curiosity coming along throughout the whole thing? There's an insatiable curiosity in spite of everything they had been given, all the gifts they had. Which proves to me that all our bellyaching about the things we want from God, and the good things we "need," and the comfortable "necessities," and all the rest would not solve the problems we have. It didn't for Adam and Eve--and we can't even imagine what they had.<br><br>The first thing they did after the fall was to hide from God. They were afraid. The first sign of disobedience to God's will is fear. What does Adam say when God finds him? "I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid," (3:10), Adam says. He'd been walking around naked since his creation. He didn't go around looking for big leaves before that.<br><br>And the Lord said, "Who told you that you were naked?_._._._Have you been eating of the tree I forbade you to eat?" (3:11).<br>The man replied, "It was the woman you put with me; she gave me the fruit, and I ate it" (3:12).<br><br>The second sign of disobedience is a failure to take personal responsibility for your actions. What he should have said was, "Eve was tempted and she gave me the fruit and I had an idea that I could resist. But I couldn't resist, and I fell." That would have been an honest answer. But he didn't say that, and neither do we. Today if you're feeling angry, or guilty--who do you blame? Yourself? No. It's always so-and-so. It's this situation. This is unfair. This is unjust. It's never you.<br>After Adam and Eve disobeyed God, they excused themselves. The sad thing is, they knew they should not listen to this enemy. They had no ignorance. They knew that this creature was evil. It wasn't a surprise. The excuse was an excuse: "he tempted me." But if you have clarity of mind and you still give in to temptation, that's the recipe for a mortal sin. Adam and Eve had clarity. They knew. Now, I don't know if they knew the consequences of their sin for all generations--we don't know that--but we do know that when they sinned they had clarity of mind and absolutely no ignorance. God said, "no," and they ignored Him. They even knew why He said no. Still they made the bad choice. And we do that each time we sin.</p><h2>The Names of Dead Girls (Canaan Crime Novels)</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;As I read Eric Rickstad&#x2019;s latest,&nbsp;<em>The Names of Dead Girls</em>, I felt myself constantly wanting to skip ahead -- anxious, desperate, to find out what was going to happen...You&#x2019;re in the hands of one of the best in the business, at the very peak of his form. &#x201c; -- Michael Harvey, author of&nbsp;<em>Brighton</em></strong></p><p><em>New York Times</em> and <em>USA Today</em> bestselling author Eric Rickstad delivers another Canaan Crime novel&nbsp;and features once again detectives Frank Rath and Sonja Test as they track a depraved killer through rural Vermont.</p><p><em>Every murder tells a story.

Combining substantive biblical principles and missiological understanding with practical insights, this book walks readers through the various models and development phases of church planting. Advocating methods that lead to church multiplication, the authors emphasize the role of the missionary church planter. They offer helpful reflection on current trends and provide best practices gathered from research and empirical findings around the globe. The book takes up a number of special issues not addressed in most church planting books, such as use of short term teams, partnerships, and wise use of resources. Full of case studies and real examples from around the world, this practical text will benefit students, church planters, missionaries, and missional church readers.</p><p>"<i>Global Church Planting </i>offers a comprehensive, biblical foundation for starting new churches, but it also gets down to the nitty-gritty of finding funding, developing a sense of the local culture, and pulling together the team that best meets the specific needs of growing a congregation in the community where the church is being planted. . . .

He traces the red thread from the great revolt of commoners in 1381 to the enclosures of Ireland, and the American commons, where European immigrants who had been expelled from their commons met the immense commons of the native peoples and the underground African American urban commons, and all the while urges the ancient spark of resistance.</p></p><p><p><b>Peter Linebaugh</b> is a historian, a professor at the University of Toledo, the coauthor of <i>Albion&#x2019;s Fatal Tree</i> and <i>The Many Headed Hydra</i>, and the author of <i>The London Hanged</i> and <i>The Magna Carta Manifesto</i>.

He was a Rush Limbaugh fan and a proud Republican, and he&#x2019;d set out on an unusual mission. He wanted to go into the Chicago public housing projects to instruct the children there in the value of hard work and entrepreneurship. He&#x2019;d do this with vegetables. His plan was to teach the kids at the Cabrini Green projects to grow high-end produce, they&#x2019;d sell their crop to the fancy restaurants that are just blocks from Cabrini, and this would be a valuable life lesson in the joys of market capitalism. </p><p>So Jack set up a garden in the middle of the high-rises, and for the first few years, it didn&#x2019;t go so well. Jack was an accountant from the white suburbs and he didn&#x2019;t relate to the kids or understand the culture of the projects. He made a lot of parents mad. A kid would miss a day&#x2019;s work in the vegetable garden and Jack would dock his pay, to teach the consequences of sloth. Then all the windows in Jack&#x2019;s truck would get smashed. Jack&#x2019;s message was not getting through. </p><p>Hoping to turn this around, he enlisted this guy named Dan Underwood, who lived in Cabrini and whose children had been working in the garden. Everyone in the projects seemed to know Dan. He ran a double-Dutch jump-rope team for Cabrini kids that was ranked number one in the city, and a drum and color-guard squad, and martial arts classes. Kids loved Dan. He was fatherly. He was fun. </p><p>And while Jack was committed to the idea that they should run the vegetable garden like a real business, Dan saw it as just another afterschool program. &#x201c;These are children,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like an adult coming to work at, you know, 8:00 and getting off at 4:30, and &#x2018;If you don&#x2019;t come, you don&#x2019;t get no money.&#x2019; That won&#x2019;t work, not with a child.&#x201d; When a kid didn&#x2019;t show up to pick tomatoes, Dan would go to the family and find out why. He&#x2019;d buy the kids pizza and take them on trips and get them singing in the van. What they needed was no mystery, as far as he was concerned. They were normal kids growing up in an unusually tough neighborhood, and they needed what any kid needs: some attention and some fun. </p><p>And sometimes, when he and Jack argued over how to run the program, they were both aware&#x2014;uncomfortably aware, I think&#x2014;how they were reenacting, in a vegetable garden surrounded by dingy high-rises, a bigger national debate. The white suburbanite was stomping around insisting that the project kids get a job and show up on time and not be coddled anymore, all for their own good, all to make them self-sufficient. The black guy was telling the interloper that he didn&#x2019;t know what he was talking about. A little coddling might be better for these kids than an enhanced appreciation of the work ethic and the free market. </p><p>When I was working on this story I thought that Jack and Dan would&#x2019;ve made a great &#x2019;70s TV show, one of those Norman Lear sitcoms where every week something happens to make all the characters argue about the big issues of the day. Sadly, we were twenty years too late for that, and Norman Lear had already set a show&#x2014;<i>Good Times</i>&#x2014;in Cabrini Green. One interesting thing about this story was how my officemate at the time hated it. Or maybe <i>hate</i>&#x2019;s too strong a word. He was suspicious of the story. And he was incredulous at how it seemed to lay out like a perfect little fable about modern America. &#x201c;Are you making these stories up?&#x201d; I remember him asking. </p><p>But I don&#x2019;t see anything wrong with a piece of reporting turning into a fable. In fact, when I&#x2019;m researching a story and the real-life situation starts to turn into allegory&#x2014;as it did with Dan and Jack&#x2014;I feel incredibly lucky, and do everything in my power to expand that part of the story. Everything suddenly stands for something so much bigger, everything has more resonance, everything&#x2019;s more engaging. Turning your back on that is rejecting tools that could make your work more powerful. But for a surprising number of reporters, the stagecraft of telling a story&#x2014;managing its fable-like qualities&#x2014;is not just of secondary concern, but a kind of mumbo jumbo that serious-minded people don&#x2019;t get too caught up in. Taking delight in this part of the job, from their perspective, has little place in our important work as journalists. Another public radio officemate at that time&#x2014;a Columbia University School of Journalism grad&#x2014;would come back from the field with funny, vivid anecdotes she&#x2019;d tell us in the hallway. Few of them ever appeared in her reports, which were dry as bones and hard to listen to. </p><p>She always had the same explanation for why she&#x2019;d omit the entertaining details: &#x201c;I thought that would be putting myself in the story.&#x201d; As if being interesting and expressing any trace of a human personality would somehow detract from the nonstop flow of facts she assumed her listeners were craving. There&#x2019;s a whole class of reporters&#x2014;especially ones who went to journalism school, by the way&#x2014;who have a strange kind of religious conviction about this. They actually get indignant; it&#x2019;s an affront to them when a reporter tries to amuse himself and his audience. </p><p>I say phooey to that. This book says phooey to that. </p><p>Most of the stories in this book come from a stack of favorite writing that I&#x2019;ve kept behind my desk for years. It started as a place to toss articles I simply didn&#x2019;t want to throw away, and it&#x2019;s a mess. Old photocopies of photocopies. Pages I&#x2019;ve torn from magazines and stapled together. Random issues of a Canadian magazine a friend edited for a while. Now and then, in working on a radio story with someone, I&#x2019;ll want to explain a certain kind of move they could try, or someone just needs inspiration. They need to see just how insanely good a piece of writing can be, and shoot for that. That&#x2019;s when I go to the stack. </p><p>As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, we&#x2019;re living in an age of great nonfiction writing, in the same way that the 1920s and &#x2019;30s were a golden age for American popular song. Giants walk among us. Cole Porters and George Gershwins and Duke Ellingtons of nonfiction storytelling. They&#x2019;re trying new things and doing pirouettes with the form. But nobody talks about it that way. </p><p>I don&#x2019;t pretend that the writers in my stack of stories are representative of a movement or a school of writing or anything like that. But they generally share a few traits. First and foremost, they&#x2019;re incredibly good reporters. And like the best reporters, they either find a new angle on something we all know about already, or&#x2014;more often&#x2014;they take on subjects that nobody else has figured out are worthy of reporting. They&#x2019;re botanists in search of plants nobody&#x2019;s given a name to yet. Take Malcolm Gladwell&#x2019;s <i>New Yorker </i>story &#x201c;Six Degrees of Lois Weisberg,&#x201d; which at first reads like any other magazine story, until you take a moment to realize what it&#x2019;s about, which is nothing less than the question &#x201c;how does everyone know everyone they know?&#x201d; Or Lee Sandlin&#x2019;s story, which is attempting to redefine everything we think about World War II and, while he&#x2019;s at it, all other wars as well. Or Michael Pollan&#x2019;s story, where he buys a steer to illustrate in the most vivid way possible a thousand details most of us don&#x2019;t know about where our meat comes from. Or Mark Bowden&#x2019;s story, which addresses a very simple question, a question that&#x2019;s so simple that once you&#x2019;ve heard it, you wonder why you&#x2019;ve never heard anybody else ask it: what was Saddam Hussein really like? </p><p>And these writers are all entertainers, in the best sense of the word. I know that&#x2019;s not how we usually talk about great reporting, but it&#x2019;s a huge part of all these stories. Great scenes, great characters, great moments. Often they&#x2019;re funny. There&#x2019;s a cheerful embracing of life in this kind of journalism, and a curiosity about the world. What hits me most when I reread Gladwell&#x2019;s story is not his skill at laying out a series of very enjoyable anecdotes and his even greater skill at deploying scientific research that sheds light on those anecdotes. What hits me most is how the article could be half the length and still hit all its big ideas, and it&#x2019;s only longer because Gladwell has found so many things that interest and amuse him, and that&#x2019;s the engine that drives the whole enterprise. There&#x2019;s a whole section of the article about actors and Kevin Bacon and Burgess Meredith that actually repeats an idea he illustrates elsewhere. And pretty much everything in the story after section five is, to my way of thinking, just there for fun. That includes Gladwell thinking through the consequences of his findings for affirmative-action programs, a scene of Gladwell trying to pin down the inner life of one of his super-connected interviewees, and&#x2014;best of all&#x2014;the completely improbable and utterly amazing story of how his protagonist, Lois Weisberg, hooked up with her second husband. </p><p>Finally, near the very end of the article, Gladwell is trying to explain once and for all why some of us know such an extraordinary number of people and, like a man writing a fable, he arrives at the moral of his story, which he points out is &#x201c;the same lesson they teach in Sunday school.&#x201d; Which is what I love about Gladwell. He stumbles onto some new phenomenon, and he&#x2019;s trying his damnedest, for page after page, to think through what it means. And part of his mission is sharing the sheer pleasure in thinking it through. This is a special kind of pleasure, and another thing we don&#x2019;t usually talk about when we talk about what makes a piece of journalism great. It&#x2019;s the pleasure of discovery, the pleasure of trying to make sense of the world. Take this joyful passage from Jack Hitt&#x2019;s story about a personal-injury lawsuit so big that the four thousand plaintiff s&#x2014;just to keep their claims straight&#x2014;actually had to write their own constitution. As Hitt notes, it&#x2019;s nearly as long as the U.S. Constitution. What first drew my attention was that absurd name. Stringfellow. Acid. Pits. Modern life rarely shunts nouns together with such Dickensian economy. After I first encountered that singular name in a newspaper article some four or five years ago, it began to appear in my life eerily, serendipitously. If I was in Washington, the Post had a short update; if in San Francisco, then the <i>Chronicle</i>. If, while dressing in a hotel, I caught an environmental lawyer on C-SPAN, then Stringfellow would be cited offhandedly and without explanation. One evening, seated at an intimate dinner party in New Haven, Connecticut, I casually mentioned my growing interest in String-fellow. Across the table a head turned and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve worked on that case.&#x201d; Then another guest spoke up. He, too, was indirectly involved. I was not following the case; it was pursuing me. The newspaper reports I read created a sense of Cyclopean dimension: a specially constructed courtroom, private judges, secret negotiations, a quarter-million pages of pretrial documents, and legal processes of absurd intricacy. The case presented a problem unique in the history of American law. How does a court try four thousand cases that are generally similar but legally different? Judge Erik Kaiser came up with an innovative solution: he would bundle the four thousand plaintiffs into groups of roughly seventeen, and try the bundled cases consecutively. Consider the math: 4,000 divided by 17=235 trials. If each one lasted a little under a year&#x2014;a conservative estimate&#x2014;the entire process would be wrapped up in two centuries. </p><p>Two-thirds of the way into his story, it takes a remarkable turn, one I&#x2019;ve rarely seen in any piece of reporting. There&#x2019;s no way for me to explain this turn without actually revealing the spoiler so jump down to the next paragraph right now if you don&#x2019;t want to know. Ready? Jack Hitt discovers that the premise of his story is completely wrong. Fantastic, right? Or here&#x2019;s an excerpt from Bill Buford&#x2019;s hilarious and disturbing book <i>Among the Thugs</i>, where he spends months with soccer hooligans in England. The thing about reporting is that it is meant to be objective. It is meant to record and relay the truth of things, as if truth were out there, hanging around, waiting for the reporter to show up. Such is the premise of objective journalism. What this premise excludes, as any student of modern literature will tell you, is that slippery relative fact of the person doing the reporting, the modern notion that there is no such thing as the perceived without someone to do the perceiving, and that to exclude the circumstances surrounding the story is to tell an untruth. . . . I do not want to tell an untruth and feel compelled, therefore, to note that at this moment, the reporter was aware that the circumstances surrounding his story had become intrusive and significant and that, if unacknowledged, his account of the events that follow would be grossly incomplete. And his circumstances were these: the reporter was very, very drunk. </p><p>That&#x2019;s the will to entertain. </p><p>Part of what&#x2019;s exciting about <i>Among the Thugs</i> is that Buford is so honest about what happens between him and his interviewees, especially the awkwardness he feels as an outsider in the midst of this tribe of drunk, violent men. They hate him, and they don&#x2019;t trust him, and he doesn&#x2019;t pretend otherwise. There&#x2019;s a transparency to the reporting. Most of the book is Buford putting himself into one situation after another, and simply describing all the chance encounters he has along the way. It&#x2019;s an inspiring book to read if you want to try your hand at reporting, because it makes the job seem so damned straightforward, and I can&#x2019;t count the number of copies I&#x2019;ve given away over the years to beginning journalists. Buford makes it clear how much of reporting is simply wandering from one place to another, talking to people and writing down what they say and trying to think of something, anything, that&#x2019;ll shed some light on what&#x2019;s happening in front of your face. </p><p>This explicitness about the process of reporting is true for many of the writers in this collection. It&#x2019;s a shame this technique is forbidden to most daily newspaper reporters and broadcast journalists, because a lot of the power of these stories comes from the writers telling you step by step what they&#x2019;re feeling and thinking, as they do their reporting. For example, here&#x2019;s how Michael Lewis explains his interest in the story of a fifteen-year-old named Jonathan Lebed&#x2014;a minor who got into trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission for trading stocks online: &#x201c;When I first read the newspaper reports last fall, I didn&#x2019;t understand them. It wasn&#x2019;t just that I didn&#x2019;t understand what the kid had done wrong; I didn&#x2019;t understand what he had done.&#x201d; </p><p>Much later in the story Lewis interviews the Chairman of the SEC about Lebed&#x2019;s supposed crime, and he does something I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;ve ever seen a reporter do in an interview with a government official. Lewis tells us what he&#x2019;s thinking, moment by moment, as the SEC Chair trots out one unconvincing argument after another. It&#x2019;s breathtaking, and skewers the guy in a way I&#x2019;ve never seen before or since in an American newspaper. What&#x2019;s even more breathtaking is that somehow, Lewis doesn&#x2019;t come across as unfair. He doesn&#x2019;t seem like a hothead, or someone with an agenda. He comes off as a curious, reasonable guy, the most reasonable guy in the room in fact...</p></p><h2>A Duke in Shining Armor: Difficult Dukes</h2><p><p><strong>A 2017 RT Reviewer's Choice Nominee for Best Historical Love &amp; Laughter!</strong></p><p><em>Not all dukes are created equal.

But for the son of an &#x201c;enemy of the people,&#x201d; those apprehensions were especially compounded.</p><p>When the secret police came for his father in 1938, ten-year-old Anatole Konstantin saw his family plunged into a morass of fear. His memoir of growing up in Stalinist Russia re-creates in vivid detail the daily trials of people trapped in this regime before and during the repressive years of World War II&#x2014;and the equally horrific struggles of refugees after that conflict.</p><p>Evicted from their home, their property confiscated, and eventually forced to leave their town, Anatole&#x2019;s family experienced the fate of millions of Soviet citizens whose loved ones fell victim to Stalin&#x2019;s purges. His mother, Raya, resorted to digging peat, stacking bricks, and even bootlegging to support herself and her two children. How she managed to hold her family together in a rapidly deteriorating society&#x2014;and how young Anatole survived the horrors of marginalization and war&#x2014;form a story more compelling than any novel.</p><p>Looking back on those years from adulthood, Konstantin reflects on both his formal education under harsh conditions and his growing awareness of the contradictions between propaganda and reality. He tells of life in the small Ukrainian town of Khmelnik just before World War II and of how some of its citizens collaborated with the German occupation, lending new insight into the fate of Ukrainian Jews and Nazi corruption of local officials. And in recounting his experiences as a refugee, he offers a new look at everyday life in early postwar Poland and Germany, as well as one of the few firsthand accounts of life in postwar Displaced Persons camps.</p><p><i>A Red Boyhood</i> takes readers inside Stalinist Russia to experience the grim realities of repression&#x2014;both under a Soviet regime and German occupation. A moving story of desperate people in desperate times, it brings to life the harsh realities of the twentieth century for young and old readers alike.</p></p><p>In 1949, upon graduation from the Technical University of Munich in Germany, Anatole Konstantin immigrated to the United States and continued his study of engineering at Columbia University. He founded PDC International Corporation and lives in Connecticut.Lamentably,&nbsp;Konstantin&#x2019;s story is common to millions of Soviet children from the 1930s and 1940s. The NKVD executed his father in 1938. In 1941, the 13-year-old, his younger brother, and his mother fled before the German invasion and survived the war&nbsp;under desperate circumstances. Returning after the German retreat to their Ukrainian hometown, they discovered the grim fates of friends and neighbors who had stayed. What stands out in Konstantin&#x2019;s account of these terrible times, besides a matter-of-fact, descriptive tone, is the author&#x2019;s fondness for his mother, who&nbsp;kept the family&nbsp;safe while enduring&nbsp;dangerous and appalling physical conditions. A resourceful woman, she seems to have improvised a solution to recurring crises of housing, food, shelter, and transportation; she never gave up. With such&nbsp;support, Konstantin managed to experience his adolescence along the usual lines of schools, favorite books, chums, and bullies&#x2013;&#x2013;though his anecdotes in these categories are anything but usual. Replete with the perils of living under communism and in wartime, Konstantin&#x2019;s lucid memoir contributes to the body of civilian witness to World War II. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>The Greek Myths: Volume 2</h2><p>Classicist and poet Robert Graves&#39;s superb two-volume retelling of the Greek myths for a modern audience has been regarded for over fifty years as the definitive version. Drawing on the entire canon of ancient literature, Graves weaves together all the elements of every myth into a single harmonious narrative. Ideal for the first time reader, it is also accompanied by commentaries, cross-references, variants and explanations that make it equally valuable as a work of scholarly reference. The result is a dazzling and comprehensive account of the gods and monsters, the heroic feats and appalling tragedies of ancient Greece, many of them among the greatest stories ever told. Included in this first volume are the great creation myths, the heroic tales of Perseus and Theseus, the tragedies of Orpheus and Icarus, the stories of the gods Aphrodite, Hermes, Apollo and Dionysus, as well as many, many others.</p><p>12 1.5-hour cassettesRobert Graves was born in 1895 in Wimbledon. He went from school to the First World War, where he became a captain in the Royal Welch Fusiliers and was seriously wounded at the Battle of the Somme.

Blackstone demonstrated that the English law as a system of justice was comparable to Roman law and the civil law of the Continent. Clearly and elegantly written, the work achieved immediate renown and exerted a powerful influence on legal education in England and in America which was to last into the late nineteenth century. The book is regarded not only as a legal classic but as a literary masterpiece. Previously available only in an expensive hardcover set, Commentaries on the Laws of England is published here in four separate volumes, each one affordably priced in a paperback edition. These works are facsimiles of the eighteenth-century first edition and are undistorted by later interpolations. Each volume deals with a particular field of law and carries with it an introduction by a leading contemporary scholar. Introducing this second volume, Of the Rights of Things, A. W. Brian Simpson discusses the history of Blackstone&#39;s theory of various aspects of property rights-real property, feudalism, estates, titles, personal property, and contracts-and the work of his predecessors.</p><p><b>A.

This essential survey of European art and visual culture in the nineteenth-century treats art forms within a broad historical framework to show the connections between visual cultural production and the political, social, and economic order of the time. Nineteenth-Century European Art was written to address a need in the market for a readable undergraduate textbook dealing with the period from 1760-1900. The new edition has been revised based in response to reviewer comments and criticisms, making it an even better and more readable book.</p><p><p> From artists Goya to Monet and Friedrich to Munch, and From the French Revolution to the Industrial Revolution and beyond, author Petra ten-Doesschate Chu charts the fascinating story of nineteenth-century European art and the driving forces that shaped it. The notion of <i>Modernism</i> as the depiction of contemporary life comes to full flower in the nineteenth century, an idea heralded by the painter Gustave Courbet and championed by the Impressionists. Beginning with the painter Edouard Manet another notion of Modernism emerges&#x2014;one that celebrates surface and texture, signaling a deliberate shift from art aimed at the imitation of nature, and in turn leading to the work of C�zanne and later to twentieth-century abstraction. These and other exciting developments in nineteenth-century European art did not abruptly appear in 1800, but were tied to specific historical events and cultural and artistic trends from about 1760, which the author cogently introduces in the first several chapters of the book. </p> <p> Alongside the story of Modernism, the author discusses several supporting factors in the history of nineteenth-century European art&#x2014;the changing relationship between artist and audience; the exposure of European artists to non-Western art due to expanding trade and travel; the impact of new technologies, such as the use of glass and iron in architecture; and changing attitudes about the depiction of nature as influenced by industrialization, ideas about so-called "primitive" cultures and "exotic" lands, and discoveries and developments in the natural sciences (e.g., Darwinism). </p> <p> References to individual artists' lives enrich the student's understanding of the art, as do sidebars that focus on specific works, techniques, or historical circumstances. The student's appreciation of the period is further enhanced by the author's broad coverage of visual culture, including painting, sculpture, architecture, the decorative arts, and the burgeoning fields of photography and graphic design. A timeline, glossary, and extensive bibliography, listing not only books but also films related to the period, complete this major achievement. </p><b>Petra ten-Doesschate Chu </b>is a leading authority on nineteenth century art. She is a professor at Seton Hall University and the author of numerous articles and essays, as well as several books, including <i>French Realism and the Dutch Masters, Courbet in Perspective, The Letters of Gustave Courbet, The Popularization of Images </i>(with Gabriel P. Weisberg), <i>The Most Arrogant Man in France: Gustave Courbet and the Nineteenth-Century Media Culture</i>, and <i>Twenty-First-Century Perspectives on Nineteenth-Century Art </i>(with Laurinda S.

John Morgan also wrote feature for <i>The Tatler, The Financial Times, The Daily Telegraph, </i>the <i>Sunday Times, The Guardian,</i> and several Conde Nast publications.<br><br>Debrett's Peerage Ltd. was founded in 1769 during the reign of King George III.

You cannot be a member of The House of Lords, without first appearing in Debrett's. Debrett's is the ultimate standard for propriety and manners.<br>1BIRTH, BAPTISM AND<br>OTHER CEREMONIES OF CHILDHOODBabies, for such small things, enter the world to a great fanfare &#x2013; not only their own, but the enthusiastic adulation of family and friends as well. They are also, in an age when procreation is increasingly regarded as positively miraculous, trumpeted to a quite unprecedented extent.<br>BIRTH<br>Announcement of a Birth<br>This is traditionally the duty of the father, who must ring any immediate relations who were not present at the birth. Close family should be the first to hear the glad tidings, followed by prospective godparents, friends and colleagues. It is then customary to place a birth announcement in the personal column of newspapers. It is also increasingly usual to leave an announcement on the telephone answering machines of close friends, adding whether or not you are receiving calls.<br>The choice of wording for a newspaper announcement varies according to personal style, although the proper form is short and elegant.<br>PROUDPARENTS &#x2013; On 22 December, to John and Jane, a son.<br>The inclusion of the year is optional. Some couples like to add the name of the hospital, the infant&#x2019;s name and the mother&#x2019;s maiden name: this, although well intentioned, is not comme il faut. Other details such as &#x2018;little brother for Andy, Pandy and Mandy&#x2019; or &#x2018;long-awaited grandchild for Don and Doris&#x2019; are even more inappropriate and should never appear. As for the entry that once appeared in a west country local paper and which included &#x2018;thanking all concerned&#x2019;, nothing needs to be said.<br>The form for single mothers takes the same pattern:<br>PROUDPARENT &#x2013; On 30 December, to Susan, a son.<br>Smart babies are often announced, at the discretion of the social editors and often free of charge, in the Court &amp; Social pages. It has also recently become the custom, immediately on deciding a baby&#x2019;s name, to send out American-style birth announcements (see Chapter 8). These can look very smart. The same cannot be said of a card showing a jolly picture of the new family, with written details on the back. After all, as one mother said: &#x2018;I was half gaga at the time, looked absolutely at my worst and am now embarrassed about these images being in constant circulation.&#x2019;<br>Registration of Birth<br>Babies have to be legally registered. In England and Wales this has to be done within forty-two days. In Scotland the period of grace is only twenty-one days. Apart from this slight difference the procedure is largely the same throughout Great Britain. Babies are registered with their local registrar of births. If the infant is born when away from home, it is possible to declare the child locally but register it through the post to the baby&#x2019;s local area. The registering of babies by married couples is very straightforward. Either parent can do the registration, as only one signature is needed. Details of both parents are put on the certificate. Although most children automatically assume the father&#x2019;s surname, an infant can be given the mother&#x2019;s or any other of choice. The position with unmarried people is slightly more complicated. The mother always has to be present. In order for the father&#x2019;s details to be included in the birth entry, he should attend the register office with the mother and sign the register with her, or he can fill in a paternity declaration on a special form from the registrar&#x2019;s office. This needs to be witnessed by a solicitor or Commissioner for Oaths and is brought along by the woman when she attends the registration. Either the mother&#x2019;s or father&#x2019;s name can be used. In some circumstances when a father denies paternity, the mother can take him to court, where it is possible to order DNA tests to prove fatherhood and thus force him to recognise the child as his. On the other hand, if the mother does not want the father&#x2019;s name on the birth certificate a line is drawn through the space for paternal details. Alternatively a mother can also add the man&#x2019;s details later, should circumstances change, such as marriage, and therefore re-register the baby.<br>Hospital Visits<br>If you are not an immediate family member it is thoughtful, no matter how happy you are for the new mother, to delay your visit for a day or so, to give time for the immediate family to spend time with their newborn and for the mother to regain her strength. This is to ensure that she, who will undoubtedly be feeling drained by the experience of childbirth, is not overtaxed with visitors. Particularly if she has had a difficult birth, being besieged with callers can make her feel totally exhausted and confused. A mother of great experience recommends that visits from well-wishers should be no longer than twenty minutes.<br>Presents<br>As far as the newborn is concerned, it is necessary only for immediate family to bring presents, although friends may give something if they wish. This can range from a practical item for the nursery to something much more substantial and permanent, such as the two million pound trust fund that was recently settled on a very lucky three-day-old baby. Clothes, unless with prior consultation, are not recommended, as most mothers have very strong ideas about how their children are to look.<br>In all the excitement surrounding the baby, it is important to remember the star performer &#x2013; the mother. An acquaintance says: &#x2018;After a birth, women long to feel feminine again and thus welcome gifts such as delicious soaps, a beautiful nightdress and, of course, flowers.&#x2019; If sending a present &#x2013; particularly flowers &#x2013; rather than taking it in person, it is sensible to check how long the mother will be staying in hospital. Nowadays, this can be a very short time indeed. Some experts also recommend that the new baby&#x2019;s siblings are also given a small present, as their noses are often out of joint after the birth of the new arrival.<br>Letters of Congratulation<br>Friends who cannot visit should write a short letter of congratulation to the happy parents. This is always addressed to the mother and could read:<br>Dear Susan,<br>I was so thrilled to hear of the arrival of your long-awaited daughter. She will make a delightful addition to the family and help keep those boisterous boys in order.<br>With much love,<br>Freddie Well-Wisher<br>If time is short, it is just acceptable to send a postcard bearing a suitable image.<br>Single Mothers<br>Many women choose to have babies without becoming attached to a man in the conventional sense. Others have accidents. In both cases it behoves family and friends to be extra supportive, as the mother will have to cope with her new family without the traditional help of a spouse.<br>Complications<br>If there are complications it is rude to ask too many questions. If a child is born with defects, unless these abnormalities are absolutely horrendous, family and friends must behave in a positive way. If a baby is stillborn or dies shortly after birth, this awful event must be treated as a family death, with letters of condolence sent to the parents.<br>Breast-Feeding in Public<br>It is bad manners to expel any liquid from any orifice in public, and breast-feeding is no different. Nevertheless, this habit remains a very sensitive area. During the sixties and seventies, many western women asserted their right to breast-feed in public. The fact that this practice has not become widespread is largely due to the fact that many onlookers (women as well as men of different generations) find the sight embarrassing, even revolting. With this in mind, well-mannered mothers should breast-feed in private. Thoughtful hosts offer lactating visitors a quiet room where they can feed away from the general throng.<br>BAPTISM<br>Despite the secularisation of society, a surprising number of babies are baptised. Research suggests that one in four babies is christened into the Church of England alone. However, there can be problems. Although most clergy are happy to baptise babies, many harbour reservations about christening babies of families who do not attend church, claiming that nonpractising Christians are unlikely to bring their children up in a truly Christian manner. Others take the more relaxed view that by baptising an infant, the Church has acquired a new recruit.<br>Many clergymen are reluctant to give private baptisms, preferring to uphold the Church of England&#x2019;s current official line that baptism is a rebirth and a welcoming to the larger Christian communion, and thus infants should be christened during normal Sunday service in the presence of the parish&#x2019;s congregation. Others do semi-private group baptisms of several babies. Policy varies from parish to parish. However, most parents still, quite understandably, want the &#x2018;specialness&#x2019; of a private christening with friends and family rather than a public affair, and there are plenty of vicars who will oblige with a private rite. As in many aspects of contemporary religion, it is down to the discretion of your local incumbent.<br>Baptism in the Church of England<br>Within the Church of England, christenings can happen at any age, although the most frequent time is at around three or four months. Clergymen hate leaving it too late, not just for the sake of the infant&#x2019;s soul, but because the older babies are, the heavier, more wriggly and increasingly difficult they become to manoeuvre. It is usual for the ceremony to take place at the local parish church. However, if parents wish for the service to take place at another church, they must first get the permission of both ministers.<br>In the case of church-going families, the arrangement of a christening is only a formality. However, should the parents never attend church, most clergy will want some assurance that the infant, once baptised, will be brought up in the tenets of the Christian faith. The majority of parishes now insist on some sort of preparation prior to the ceremony: this can range from a single conversation about the meaning of the service to a series of classes or training sessions.<br>Normally, the local parish priest performs the service. However, some couples wish to have the ceremony conducted by a family member or friend who is in Holy Orders. In these cases it is important to remember that men of the cloth can be as territorial as those of the laity, and thus the local priest&#x2019;s permission will have to be tactfully sought. Also, should a child be christened outside its own diocese, then it is courteous to inform the bishop by letter that this is happening.<br>There are two main liturgies to choose from. The first is the traditional service from the Book of Common Prayer, which is very beautiful, places a strong emphasis on the renunciation of evil and is preferred by many to the revised texts in the Alternative Service Book. The latter is written in more modern English and is designed to present a more contemporary view of Christianity.<br>Whichever service is chosen, the central act of the ceremony remains largely constant. Parents and godparents gather around the font with the baby and are asked by the minister to affirm their belief in Christ and the renunciation of all evil. Holding the child, the priest then pours or sprinkles holy water on to the infant&#x2019;s forehead and using the child&#x2019;s new Christian names declares: &#x2018;I baptise you in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#x2019; The priest then makes the sign of the cross on the young forehead. Sometimes a lighted candle is presented to the family and specially blessed oils are used to anoint the baby. It is usual for the father to go to the vestry to register the christening. There is always a fee payable for a certificate of baptism, and should the baptism have been a private affair, then a small donation to church funds is welcomed. There is one family who, as their gesture of appreciation, organised for flowers to be delivered to the church for three Sundays after the christening of their newborn. This lovely gesture was much appreciated.<br>The dress for the christening ought to be special. Women should wear hats and men dark suits. The infant is resplendent in a white gown (this is often part of a family&#x2019;s history) that signifies purity. Sometimes a little white bonnet is also worn. Should you wish to baptise your child in an ancestral gown, it is sensible to remember that in the past babies were smaller than today. Thus your bouncing baby might be too big for the antique: certainly an early christening is advised.<br>Announcements in the Press<br>Written announcements of christenings in the Court &amp; Social pages of national newspapers are increasingly rare, although traditionally minded families like to keep up the custom. Typical wording could read:<br>The infant daughter of The Earl and Countess of Proudparentland was christened Augusta Boadicea by the Reverend Timothy Tremble at St Margaret&#x2019;s, Westminster, on Thursday 21 December. The god-parents are The Hon. Tiggy Tintangel, Mrs Peter Pork-Sausage and The Lord Tickle.<br>Note, in the case of a male infant, the names of the godfathers precede those of godmothers.<br>Catholic Baptism<br>This tends to be a rather more elaborate and lengthy affair than the Anglican rite, although in recent years it has been simplified by innovations from the Vatican. Although practices vary from parish to parish, the Roman Catholic Church, like the Church of England, now officially discourages the practice of private baptism, although in most cases the choice of baptism during mass or outside it is available (and there are still priests who will perform a private service). One godparent (or sponsor) has to be a Roman Catholic of good standing, and only his or her name is entered in the register. Sometimes there is a hymn at the beginning of the service. The parents and godparents trace the sign of the cross on the infant&#x2019;s forehead. Then follows a reading from Scripture, and a short homily and prayers. After this the infant is anointed with catechumenal oil by the priest. Parents and god-parents renounce Satan and profess their faith in God. The actual baptism is then performed. After this the child is anointed with chrism oils and wrapped in a pure white robe, and its father or godfather holds a candle lit from the Paschal candle held by the priest. This elaborate ritual concludes with the saying of the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer, a blessing and the signing of the register. If the service has included an organist, there might be a fee payable to him. The priest does not charge for his services, but an offering is always appreciated. It is most important to keep the baptismal certificate, as it will be needed for future rites of religious passage, such as weddings, and for applications to Roman Catholic schools.<br>Jewish Procedures<br>Traditionally, male infants are subjected to an ancient rite called Brit Milah, at which they are circumcised at an official ceremony presided over by a mohel. This usually takes place seven days after the birth and is held at home and not at the synagogue. The rite is attended by the parents, grandparents and friends. Sandeks, the Jewish equivalent of godparents, will also be present. These may be any Jewish male, and to be asked to fulfil this role is a particular honour in the faith. The godfather holds the infant during the procedure and the father recites a special prayer. The mohel is the one who actually wields the knife, as well as reciting prayers and a blessing over a goblet of wine. The baby is then given its Hebrew name which signifies its initiation into the faith. It is considered bad luck to make any reference to the baby&#x2019;s name until after the circumcision. Female infants are spared this religious initiation and are expected only to attend the synagogue on the first Sabbath after the birth, when the father is called up or reads the Torah and the baby is given its Hebrew name. Some Reform and Liberal Jews have stripped the ritual circumcision of so...</p><h2>Pacemaker Pre Algebra Teacher Answer Second Edition 2001c (Fearon&#39;s Pre-Algebra)</h2><p><p>Provide a strong foundation for future math learning</p><p>Designed as a foundation for algebra, this comprehensive program motivates students as they build the important skills and confidence they need to take on algebra.

The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird spy plane flew more than three-and-a-half times the speed of sound--so fast that no other aircraft could catch it. Above 80,000 feet, its pilots had to wear full-pressure flight suits similar to what was used aboard the space shuttle.</p><p>Developed by the renowned Lockheed Skunk Works, the SR-71 was an awesome aircraft in every respect. It was withdrawn from use in 1998, when it was superseded by satellite technology. Twelve of the thirty-two aircraft were destroyed in accidents, but none were ever lost to enemy action.</p><p>Throughout its thirty-four-year career, the SR-71 was the world's fastest and highest-flying operational manned aircraft. It set world records for altitude and speed: an absolute altitude record of 85,069 feet and an absolute speed record of 2,193.2 miles per hour.</p><p><i>The Complete Book of the SR-71 Blackbird</i> covers every aspect of the SR-71's development, manufacture, modification, and active service from the insider's perspective of one of its pilots and is lavishly illustrated with more than 400 photos. Former pilot and author Richard Graham also examines each of the fifty planes that came out the SR-71 program (fifteen A-12s; three YF-12s; and thirty-two SR-71s) and tells each plane's history, its unique specifications, and where each currently resides.</p></p><p><p>A veteran of fifteen years of assignments within the SR-71 community, <b>Colonel Richard H. Graham</b> is uniquely qualified to tell the Blackbird's story. Crew member, instructor pilot, chief of the standardization/evaluation division, Colonel Graham was named SR-71 Squadron Commander, 1st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, in January 1981. A command pilot with more than 4,600 military flying hours, he has earned military decorations and awards including the Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross with three oak leaf clusters, Air Medal with eighteen oak leaf clusters, Air Force Commendation Medal, Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with "V" device and one oak leaf cluster, Air Force Organizational Excellence Award, Combat Readiness Medal with one oak leaf cluster, National Defense Service Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with four service stars, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with palm, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal.

He graduated from Harvard in 1837, the same year he began his lifelong Journal. Inspired by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau became a key member of the Transcendentalist movement that included Margaret Fuller and Bronson Alcott. The Transcendentalists' faith in nature was tested by Thoreau between 1845 and 1847 when he lived for twenty-six months in a homemade hut at Walden Pond. While living at Walden, Thoreau worked on the two books published during his lifetime: <b>Walden</b> (1854) and <b>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</b> (1849). Several of his other works, including <b>The Maine Woods, Cape Cod</b>, and <b>Excursions</b>, were published posthumously.

The actress is Ingrid Caven, the director's former wife and the woman with whom he claims to have his most important "elective affinity." At once provocative and revealing, the scene illustrates Fassbinder's interest in blurring the boundaries between art and life, between fiction and autobiography. His public comments - like his films and plays - were occasions for aesthetic experimentation rich in irony and drama.<br>The Anarchy of the Imagination collects Fassbinder's most important interviews, essays, and working notes - nearly all presented here for the first time in English. They are an indispensable record of the self-understanding and self-stylization of this major artist, one of the most influential cultural figures to emerge from postwar Germany. Fassbinder's essays and other writings commanded a degree of public attention rarely achieved by film makers in the United States. His articles appeared in major newspapers such as the Frankfurter Rundschau and Die Zeit, where they both influenced the cultural scene and intervened in the acrimonious debates on terrorism and anti-Semitism that swept West Germany in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<br>Whether Fassbinder is reflecting on his own work or writing about fellow film makers, whether he is describing his discovery of actress Hanna Schygulla or speaking out in favor of political film making, his perspective is radical, subjective, and challenging. The writings in this volume are not only about films, but about love, longing, dependency, repressed wishes, and dreams. They are an essential part of Fassbinder's legacy, the remarkable body of work in which present-day German reality finds brilliant expression.</p><p>This book collects the most important interviews, essays, and working notes of Rainer Werner Fassbinder, one of the most influential cultural figures to emerge from postwar Germany.

But "Odessa" was nothing more than a myth. Now, in <em>Nazis on the Run</em>, historian Gerald Steinacher provides the true story of how the Nazis escaped their fate. <br> Steinacher not only reveals how Nazi war criminals escaped from justice at the end of the Second World War, fleeing through the Tyrolean Alps to Italian seaports, but he also highlights the key roles played by the Red Cross, the Vatican, and the Secret Services of the major powers. The book takes a hard look at the International Committee of the Red Cross, proving that identification papers issued by the Red Cross made it possible for thousands of Nazis, war criminals, and collaborators--including Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengale--to slip through the hands of justice and to find refuge in North and South America, Spain, and the Near East. Steinacher underscores the importance of the South Tyrol as a "ratline" from Germany to Italy and also reveals that many figures in the Catholic Church--sometimes knowingly, other times unwittingly--were involved in large-scale Nazi smuggling, often driven by the fear of an imminent communist takeover of Italy. Finally, the book documents how the Counter Intelligence Corps and later the CIA recruited former SS men to advise U.S. intelligence agencies and smuggled them out of Soviet-occupied areas of Austria and Eastern Europe into Italy and on to South America.<br> Based on extensive research in newly opened archives, <em>Nazis on the Run</em> is the first book to provide a complete picture of this little-known story of justice denied.</p><p><br><strong>Gerald Steinacher</strong> is currently a Joseph A. Schumpeter Research Fellow at the Center for European Studies at Harvard University and Lecturer on Contemporary History at the University of Innsbruck, Austria.<br>Gerald Steinacher&#39;s &#39;Nazis auf der Flucht&#39; offers a well-researched, deeply engaging, and exhaustive analysis of escape routes of high-ranking Nazis and war criminals via Italy to Argentina and other overseas destinations. It makes an important contribution to our understanding of Nazi escape routes, for it not only demystifies the Odessa myth, but also sheds light on the complicity of influential organizations such as the Catholic Curch, the International Red Cross, and the U.S. and Argentinean governments. Natalie Eppelsheimer, German Studies Review Coming now and in the next few weeks are at least two important new works of nonfiction about the Nazis besides Larson&#39;s, from Austrian historian Gerald Steinacher and British historian Frederick Taylor. Philipp Kerr, Washington Post Steinacher uses an array of records including recently declassified US intelligence files, various official Italian and German archives, the archives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Geneva, Catholic Church records from the National Catholic Welfare Conference and from the Instituto Santa Maria dell&#39;Anima (the German/Austrian Church in Rome), and a host of local records from South Tyrolean towns. The result is a fine study and a great read. Norman W. Goda, The International History Review Gerald Steinacher describes exactly how they managed this in &#34;Nazis on the Run&#34;-only the second authoritative book on the subject, after Uki Goni&#39;s &#34;The Real Odessa&#34; (2002). Philip Kerr, Wall Street Journal Steinacher offers much new information Robert Knight, Times Literary Supplement a well-written book that is packed with startling information and grubby stories about the moral cost of political exigency. David Cesarnani New Statesman In this murky world of hidden identities, deception and secrets, it is good to have a book as level-headed as this one, based on thorough research. Richard J. Evans, The Guardian This book will be the standard for generations of historians who wish to study the fate of Hitler&#39;s followers who evaded justice for decades or escaped it altogether.

Though we have made best efforts - the books may have occasional errors that do not impede the reading experience. We believe this work is culturally important and have elected to bring the book back into print as part of our continuing commitment to the preservation of printed works worldwide.</p><p>Translated by G M A Grube; Revised by John M CooperMost of us remember THE APOLOGY as one of those dry Philosophy 101 texts we struggled to finish, but Tom Griffith's new translation in this Naxos production is far from dry. Socrates's defense of his life and, ironically, of his death, possesses a stunning immediacy: It is colloquial yet faithful, contemporary yet ancient, poignant yet timeless. The performance of Bruce Alexander, Jamie Glover, and company brings all the graceful resignation and patient humor of the 72-year-old man to new life, as only seasoned actors can. They give us the feel of what it must have been like in the jail that strange day 2,500 years ago when Athens put their most thoughtful citizen to death because he troubled their sleep. Naxos even provides an original soundtrack, haunting and meditative, to bridge the awkward transitions in the action. Everything is done, in short, to take Socrates from that dry 101 text to our own neighborhood.

Here, in the late 1960s, a young Colombian development worker named Paolo Lugari wondered if the nearly uninhabited, infertile llanos could be made livable for his country&#x2019;s growing population. He had no idea that nearly four decades later, his experiment would be one of the world&#x2019;s most celebrated examples of sustainable living: a permanent village called Gaviotas.</p> <p>In the absence of infrastructure, the first Gaviotans invented wind turbines to convert mild breezes into energy, hand pumps capable of tapping deep sources of water, and solar collectors efficient enough to heat and even sterilize drinking water under perennially cloudy llano skies. Over time, the Gaviotans&#x2019; experimentation has even restored an ecosystem: in the shelter of two million Caribbean pines planted as a source of renewable commercial resin, a primordial rain forest that once covered the llanos is unexpectedly reestablishing itself.</p> <p>Colombian author Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez has called Paolo Lugari &#x201c;Inventor of the World.&#x201d; Lugari himself has said that Gaviotas is not a utopia: &#x201c;<em>Utopia</em> literally means &#x2018;no place.&#x2019; We call Gaviotas a <em>topia</em>, because it&#x2019;s real.&#x201d;</p> <p>Relive their story with this special 10th-anniversary edition of <em>Gaviotas</em>, complete with a new afterword by the author describing how Gaviotas has survived and progressed over the past decade.</p></p><p><p>Author of the critically acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> best seller <em>The World Without Us</em>, Alan Weisman is an award-winning journalist whose reports have appeared in <em>Harper&#x2019;s</em>, the <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, <em>Discover</em>, and <em>Orion</em>, among others, and on National Public Radio. A former contributing editor to the <em>Los Angeles Times Magazine</em>, he is a senior radio producer for Homelands Productions and teaches international journalism at the University of Arizona. He lives in western Massachusetts.</p>In the early 1970s, a unique community was founded in the los llanos region of Colombia. Located north of the Amazon rain forest, this region is an expansive savannah, sparsely populated and generally considered uninhabitable. Gaviotas originated out of the belief that the current state of urban expansion and poverty and the continued depletion of natural nonrenewable resources could not be sustained and that the future required people to learn how to live in harsh, inhospitable environments and to do so in an ecologically sound and sustainable manner. Journalist Weisman tells the story of a remarkable and diverse group of individuals (engineers, biologists, botanists, agriculturists, sociologists, musicians, artists, doctors, teachers, and students) who helped the village evolve into a very real, socially viable, and self-sufficient community for the future. The people of Gaviotas today produce innovative technologies (solar collectors, irrigation systems, windmills, and hydroponic gardens) that use the environment without depleting or destroying it. While some of their creative endeavors have not succeeded, even the failures tend to spawn ideas for future successes. Weisman does a fine job of detailing Gaviotas's evolution and placing it within the larger global historical context.

But when his creature first stirs, he realizes he has constructed a monster. Abandoned by its maker and shunned by everyone who sees it, the monster turns on its creator and haunts Dr. Frankenstein with murder and horrors to the very ends of the earth. Artist Frazer Irving's cinematic and moving portrayal of the doctor and his creation is sympathetic and powerful.</p><p>Mary Shelley (August 30, 1797 - February 1, 1851)&nbsp;was the daughter of Mary Wollestonecraft, the ardent feminist and author of&nbsp;<i>A Vindication on the Right of Women,&nbsp;</i>and William Goodwin, the Radical-anarchist philosopher and author of&nbsp;<i>Lives of the Necromancers.&nbsp;</i>At sixteen, she eloped with the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley; they eventually married in 1816.&nbsp;Mary did not begin to write seriously until the summer of 1816, when she and Shelley were in Switzerland, neighbor to Lord Byron. One night following a contest to compose ghost stories, Mary conceived her masterpeice,&nbsp;<i>Frankenstein.&nbsp;</i>After Shelley&#x2019;s death she continued to write&nbsp;<i>Valperga</i>(1823),&nbsp;<i>The Last Man&nbsp;</i>(1826),&nbsp;<i>Ladore&nbsp;</i>(1835),&nbsp;and<i>&nbsp;Faulkner</i>(1837), in addition to editing her husband&#x2019;s works.Gr. 7-10. The unforeseen consequences of pride and progress come clear in this brooding graphic-novel adaptation of Shelley's much read and debated classic, the first in a new curriculum-connected series, Puffin Graphics. Reed concentrates on the emotional anguish of the story, ably capturing the rage, the hurt, and the guilt of both monster and creator. Irving, who has worked for DC and Dark Horse Comics, among others, creates a hazy, suitably murky black-and-white backdrop, never exploiting the violence inherent in the monster's quest for vengeance. At times, however, the facial expressions of his characters seem at odds with the mood; Victor's friend Henry sometimes looks more like a happy idiot than a concerned, steadfast ally. But there are also some stunning sequences, as when Victor, pictured in shadowy candlelight and surrounded by books, researches the secret to life. Back matter about Shelley is sketchy, and Irving's sample storyboards, though interesting, are less so than the cover samples. Those are small concerns, however, given the overall product, which will attract readers both younger and older than the target audience.

Many up-to-date and judicious discussions of debated issues in Pauline studies are included, studded with illuminating primary and secondary source quotations. The authors stress Paul&#x2019;s &#x201c;apocalyptic narrative&#x201d; as providing coherence to the letters, as well as reconstruct other metanarratives---about the covenant people Israel and the Roman imperial order---that help contextualize Paul within Jewish and Roman milieux.

Not only are Longenecker and Still notable Pauline scholars, but they introduce the life and letters of Paul in a clear manner and with fairness when addressing debated issues. Perhaps most importantly---something that sets this introduction apart from many others---the authors help us to appreciate Paul&#x2019;s rich and complex thought and challenge us to wrestle with his theology for ourselves. Longenecker and Still succeed precisely in their aim, to facilitate &#x201c;thinking through Paul.&#x201d; The job is never done; it has only begun, but this is a wise place to begin. I look forward to introducing this book to my students! -- Nijay K.

Here is a beautifully produced and efficiently organized introduction to Paul. -- Scot McKnight, Northern Seminary</p><h2>An Analysis of C.L.R. James&#39;s The Black Jacobins: The Black Jacobins (The Macat Library)</h2><p><p>Today we take it for granted that history is much more than the story of great men and the elites from which they spring. Other forms of history &#x2013; the histories of gender, class, rebellion and nonconformity &#x2013; add much-needed context and color to our understanding of the past. But this has not always been so. In CLR James&#x2019;s The Black Jacobins, we have one of the earliest, and most defining, examples of how &#x2018;history from below&#x2019; ought to be written. </p> <p>James's approach is based on his need to resolve two central problems: to understand why the Haitian slave revolt was the only example of a successful slave rebellion in history, and also to grasp the ways in which its history was intertwined with the history of the French Revolution. The book's originality, and its value, rests on its author's ability to ask and answer productive questions of this sort, and in the creativity with which he proved able to generate new hypotheses as a result. As any enduring work of history must be, <em>The Black Jacobins</em> is rooted in sound archival research &#x2013; but its true greatness lies in the originality of James's approach.</p></p><p><p><strong>Nick Broten</strong> was educated at the California Institute of Technology and the London School of Economics.

Her interests were both mystical and intellectual, including natural history, medicine, and science. Her musical works are performed even today. She is best known, though, for three lengthy theological works--discussed in some detail here--that came about from her visionary experiences.

Warning against individual and societal complacence about economic inequity, he offers an economic model for investing in public wealth that challenges &#x201c;conventional wisdom&#x201d; (a phrase he coined that has since entered our vernacular) about the long-term value of a production-based economy and the true nature of poverty. Both politically divisive and remarkably prescient, <i>The Affluent Society</i> is as relevant today on the question of wealth in America as it was in 1958.</p></p><p>Conventional wisdom has it that John Kenneth Galbraith's <i>The Affluent Society</i> spawned the neoliberalism we see in Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, and other world leaders. The economist's prose, lofty but still easily manageable, laid down the gauntlet for the post-cold war class struggle that was still far in the future in 1958. Galbraith saw the widening gap between the richest and the poorest as an emergent threat to economic stability, and proposed significant investment in parks, transportation, education, and other public amenities--what we now call infrastructure--to ameliorate these differences and postpone depression and revolution indefinitely. Widely criticized by conservatives and libertarians wary of public expenditures or increased government influence, Galbraith still influences liberal and neoliberal thinking. He has acknowledged that his work, like that of most social scientists, contains flaws (like his dire prediction of an out-of-control unemployment and inflation spiral that petered out in the 1980's), but much of it remains fresh and true even today. Four years before <i>Silent Spring</i>, he wrote about the consumerist blight that threatened our wild lands equally as much as our cities; his hoped-for increase in environmental awareness has grown significantly in recent years. Whether you support the political implementations of his views, experiencing his writing is important to put those views in context. More than this, though, it is an honest pleasure to read such original ideas so well expressed. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><p><b>John Kenneth Galbraith</b> (1908-2006) was a critically acclaimed author and one of America's foremost economists.

Yet its difficulty&#x2015;and sheer variety&#x2015;leaves many readers puzzled or overwhelmed. The critic, scholar, and poet Stephanie Burt sets out to help. Beginning in the early 1980s, where critical consensus ends, Burt canvasses American poetry of the past four decades, from the headline-making urgency of Claudia Rankine&#x2019;s <i>Citizen</i> to the stark pathos of Louise Gl�ck, the limitless energy of Juan Felipe Herrera, and the erotic provocations of D. A. Powell.</p><p><i>The Poem Is You: Sixty Contemporary American Poems and How to Read Them </i>is a guide to the diverse magnificences of American poetry today. It presents a wide range of poems selected by Burt for this volume, each accompanied by an original essay explaining how a given poem works, why it matters, and how the poem speaks to other parts of art and culture. Included here are some classroom classics (by Ashbery, Komunyakaa, Hass), less famous poems by very famous poets (Gl�ck, Kay Ryan), and poems by prizewinning poets near the start of their careers (such as Brandon Som), and by others who are not&#x2015;or not yet&#x2015;well known.</p><p><i>The Poem Is You</i> will appeal to poets, teachers, and students, but it is intended especially for readers who want to learn more about contemporary American poetry but who have not known where or how to start. It describes what American poets have fashioned for one another, and what they can give us today.</p></p><p>Stephanie Burt is Professor of English at Harvard University.&#x201c;It is refreshing to find a book that gives equal weight and relish to avant-garde minimalism, New Formalism, and so many of the stations in between...The poems Burt selects would alone comprise a valuable anthology of the American poetry of its time, and [she] is an entertaining, thought-provoking and eager guide to them, keen to ask all the questions that occur to [her] in [her] reading, and to engage with the chicanery of thought it engenders. Each essay is obviously a product of enjoyment, and encourages us to treat poems with the same enthusiasm&#x2015;to embrace difficulty and difference in exchange for the articulate and involved pleasure that poetry, of all the arts, can best provide.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Rory Waterman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Burt] approaches a stunning variety of verse with the obsessiveness and knowledge of a scholar and a fan. Burt is an ideal guide for this trip through contemporary American poetry...Burt&#x2019;s close readings are sharp and illuminating...The death of poetry has been proclaimed time and time again. But the sixty universes that Burt uncovers in these poems show us how alive poetry is, and how it needs to be read and appreciated for all its weirdness and cacophonous music...Whether you dip in and out of this book over months or read it all in a matter of days, it will help you pay better attention to the nuances, difficulties, identities, and music in American poetry...What comes through here is Burt's sheer, voracious love of contemporary poetry, and it's infectious. This book is a series of doors that all lead back to the poems themselves, and it will likely be used in classrooms across America.

Each chapter explores a specific defining food or tradition of the region--such as salt, beans, corn (and corn liquor). The essays introduce readers to their rich histories and the farmers, curers, hunters, and chefs who define the region's contemporary landscape. Sitting at a diverse intersection of cuisines, Appalachia offers a wide range of ingredients and products that can be transformed using traditional methods and contemporary applications. Through 80 recipes and stories gathered on her travels in the region, Lundy shares dishes that distill the story and flavors of the Mountain South.<br>&#x2013; <i>Epicurious</i>: Best Cookbooks of 2016</p><p>Born in Corbin, Kentucky, <b>RONNI LUNDY </b>has long chronicled the people of the hillbilly diaspora as a journalist and cookbook author. She is the former restaurant reviewer and music critic for&nbsp;<i>The Courier-Journal</i>&nbsp;in Louisville, former editor of&nbsp;<i>Louisville Magazine,</i>&nbsp;and has contributed to many national magazines. Her book&nbsp;<i>Shuck Beans, Stack Cakes and Honest Fried Chicken</i>&nbsp;was recognized by&nbsp;<i>Gourmet</i>&nbsp;magazine as one of six essential books on Southern cooking. In 2009, Lundy received the Southern Foodways Alliance Craig Claiborne Lifetime Achievement Award. She has contributed to&nbsp;<i>Eating Well</i>,<i>Gourmet</i>,&nbsp;<i>Bon App�tit</i>,&nbsp;<i>Esquire</i>, and other magazines.&#x201c;<i>Victuals</i>&nbsp;promises to be the jewel in [Ronni Lundy&#x2019;s] crown, setting the record straight about her native cuisine, too long dismissed as homogenized, and telling instead the real story of a cookery thrillingly formed at the crossings of African, European, and Native Nation traditions. Did we mention it comes with recipes?&#x201d;--<b><i>Oxford American</i></b><br><br>"Each chapter of Victuals focuses on a tentpole of Appalachian cuisine; an ingredient or a tradition. Essays on each, along with 80 recipes, tell the story of this diverse mountain cuisine through the words of one of its biggest champions." -- <b>Epicurious</b><br><br>&#x201d;Lundy is a warm and charming guide with a deep-seated love and respect for the region and its approach to cuisine.

It's a journey that comes alive in color far more vivid than those images you'll often see, the kind that paint Appalachia as a backwater monoculture."&nbsp;<b>--<i>USA Today<br><br></i></b>"To call it a cookbook seems almost unfair. This is not just a collection of recipes or, as so many cookbooks these days are, a "branding opportunity" for an aspiring chef. &nbsp;In <i>Victuals</i> -- which the book's cover makes clear is pronounced "viddles" -- Lundy has written a love letter to the foods, culture, and fortitude of Appalachian people." <b><i>--Washington Post<br></i></b><br>"Part reminiscence, part living history, <i>Victuals </i>(right on the book cover, Lundy stresses that the word is pronounced &#x201c;vi-dls&#x201d;) would be an important study of southern Appalachia even without the 80 recipes that illustrate the region&#x2019;s culinary diversity."&nbsp;<b>--Chicago Tribune</b><br><br>"Victuals&nbsp;is a breathtaking work of literature that sneaks up on you, casts a spell, and corrects your misconceptions; it&#x2019;s a cookbook less about cook and more book."<b>--The A.V.

It invites us to bring the advantages of "slow" to our community decision making. Just as slow food encourages chefs and eaters to become more intimately involved with the production of local food, slow democracy encourages us to govern ourselves locally with processes that are inclusive, deliberative, and citizen powered.</p> <p>Susan Clark and Woden Teachout outline the qualities of real, local decision making and show us the range of ways that communities are breathing new life into participatory democracy around the country. We meet residents who seize back control of their municipal water systems from global corporations, parents who find unique solutions to seemingly divisive school-redistricting issues, and a host of other citizens across the nation who have designed local decision-making systems to solve the problems unique to their area in ways that work best for their communities.</p> <p>Though rooted in the direct participation that defined our nation's early days, slow democracy is not a romantic vision for reigniting the ways of old. Rather, the strategies outlined here are uniquely suited to 21st-century technologies and culture.If our future holds an increased focus on local food, local energy, and local economy, then surely we will need to improve our skills at local governance as well.</p></p><p><p>Susan Clark is a writer and facilitator focusing on community sustainability and citizen participation. She is an award-winning radio commentator and former talk show co-host. Her democratic activism has earned her broad recognition, including the 2010 Vermont Secretary of State's Enduring Democracy Award.&nbsp; Clark is the coauthor of <em>Slow Democracy: Rediscovering Community, Bringing Decision Making Back Home</em> (Chelsea Green, 2012), and<em> All Those In Favor: Rediscovering the Secrets of Town Meeting and Community</em> (RavenMark, 2005). Her work strengthening communities has included directing a community activists' network and facilitating town visioning forums. She served as communication and education director of the Vermont Natural Resources Council and Coordinator of the University of Vermont's Environmental Programs In Communities (EPIC) project.&nbsp; Clark lives in Middlesex, Vermont, where she chairs a committee that encourages citizen involvement, and serves as town-meeting moderator.<br></p><br><br><p>Woden Teachout is an historian and cultural critic interested in the development of American patriotic culture.&nbsp; She is currently professor of graduate studies at Union Institute and University and has taught at a number of colleges and universities, including Harvard, Middlebury College, and Goddard College. She is the co-author, with Susan Clark, of <em>Slow Democracy: Rediscovering Community, Bringing Decision Making Back Home</em> (Chelsea Green).</p><p><em><strong>ForeWord Reviews-</strong></em><br><br>In the nineteenth century, robust public participation and civic action was part of the American character. By contrast, we currently comprise a &#x201c;discouraged, democratically anemic citizenry,&#x201d; feeling disempowered and voiceless when it comes to influencing the outcome of public policy issues that affect us, our cities, towns, and neighborhoods.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, there is a way out of this morass&#x2015;it&#x2019;s called &#x2018;slow democracy.&#x2019; Taking its cue from the slow food movement (a global, grassroots effort that links a way of living and a way of eating with a commitment to community and sustainability), slow democracy encourages democratic decision-making at the local level by members of the community. It forgoes the ideological divisions of left vs. right and promotes self-governance through processes that are inclusive, deliberative, and citizen-powered.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the notion of wresting power and decision making from the federal level and returning it to citizens and local governments may seem like pie-in-the-sky optimism, activist [Susan] Clark and historian [Woden] Teachout cite numerous places where slow democracy is producing results. In New York City; Chicago; Gloucester, Massachusetts; New Orleans; Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and Hacker Valley, West Virginia &#x201c;painful issues&#x201d; like racism and crime and &#x2018;too-hot-to-handle concerns&#x2019; like budget cuts, school redistricting, environmental protection, and housing are being addressed by ordinary people committed to citizen engagement and collaborative problem-solving.&nbsp; <em>Slow Democracy</em>&nbsp;is a user-friendly &#x2018;blueprint for American redemption.&#x2019; It inspires the belief that our dwindling democracy can be invigorated. City councilors, town managers, community organizers, politicians, and average Americans will find wisdom in&nbsp;<em>Slow Democracy</em>&nbsp;and will learn strategies to bolster public participation and thus transform our political landscape.</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Library Journal-</strong></em><br><br>Clark (<em>All Those in Favor</em>) and Teachout (Union Inst. &amp; Univ.; <em>Capture the Flag</em>) make a strong case for &#x2018;slow democracy&#x2019;&#x2015;the inclusive, deliberative, locally based way to reinvigorate American politics. Based on the slow food movement&#x2019;s principles of localism, community involvement, and sustainability, slow democracy taps the energy, concerns, and common sense of local citizens to improve local decisions. Clark and Teachout explain slow democracy in action, discuss reframing debates to avoid the polarization that passes for politics in the United States, and suggest ways for people to adapt the principles of slow democracy for use in their own political lives. The authors admit that slow democracy takes time&#x2015;time to gather community members, time for all to tell their stories, and time for citizen groups to find practical and affordable solutions to local problems. VERDICT: This is a convincing argument that time invested in this way benefits everyone in the community and reconnects citizens with their governments and each other. Recommended for anyone interested in being more politically engaged.</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Publisher's Weekly-</strong></em><br><br>Making the case for local control and community action while offering plenty of worthwhile advice, community leader Clark and democracy scholar Teachout tell how to get things done in the public sphere. The authors are open about their leftist leanings but make it clear that "slow democracy" is not about partisanship or political labels. On issues including community control of water systems and school re-districting, the authors paint an upbeat picture of participatory democracy. They devote much of the book to success stories, mainly from small cities like Portsmouth, N.H. Intending to be inspirational, sometimes lyrical and crunchy-granola in spirit, Clark and Teachout can resort to the obvious or mundane: "[s]low democracy is about inviting neighbors into community conversations about issues that matter." But readers who instinctively resist suffocating regulations and Big Brother authorities will welcome the book's insights. Clark and Teachout favor a New England-style town-hall political culture that wouldn't last five minutes in Chicago or Los Angeles, yet anyone who wants to reinvigorate grass-roots involvement and moderate top-down rule can benefit from this earnest volume. Activists and organizers will appreciate the useful tips, and Clark and Teachout's community strategies will resonate with both conservatives and progressives.</p><br><br><p><em><strong> Kirkus Reviews-</strong></em><br><br>How community deliberative processes can provide an alternative to divisive party politics and technocratic expertise. Community organizer Clark (co-author:&nbsp;<em>All Those in Favor: Rediscovering the Secrets of Town Meeting and Community</em>,&nbsp;2005) and historian Teachout (Graduate Studies/Union Institute and Univ.;&nbsp;<em>Capture the Flag: A Political History of American Patriotism,&nbsp;</em>2009, etc.) believe that genuine deliberations by citizens have too often been replaced by top-down political decision-making, in much the same way fast food has been substituted for the genuine article. The authors present case studies in which citizens have come together to solve problems faced by their communities. They cite the city of Portsmouth, N.H., which has won international awards for the way citizens acted together to solve problems confronting their school system when the experts failed. They chronicle citizen transformation of social services, such as Chicago's Police Department, and citizen interventions to take control of municipal or county water supplies. The authors highlight the way Pennsylvanians have organized against fracking through town and county institutions. Each of these cases, they note, was precipitated by a particular set of circumstances that needed to be addressed in a timely way. Clark and Teachout complement their case studies with discussions of useful methodologies to bring people together for common purposes and with a brief history of the New England town meeting format. The major problem local communities face, they write, is outside &#x201c;efficiency experts&#x201d; armed with charts and graphs and prepackaged solutions. The authors offer the history of the Appalachian Trail, which runs from Maine to Georgia, as a dramatic example of how &#x201c;slow politics&#x201d; works over an extended period of time to build something of lasting value. A valuable tool for improving the way government operates at the local level.</p><br><br><p>"Slow democracy is the only kind that can take root, because it answers our deepest longings for connection, community, and voice.

Finally, they show how improving local democracy, one place at a time, can add up quickly to much larger national and global impacts."<strong>--Matt Leighninger, executive director, Deliberative Democracy Consortium</strong></p><br><br><p>"It is all too easy to be cynical about the contemporary democratic process.

Carolyn James has unearthed startling new insights from this well-worn story ... insights that have life-changing implications for you. Naomi is no longer regarded as a bitter, complaining woman, but as a courageous overcomer. A Female Job. Ruth (typically admired for her devotion to Naomi and her deference to Boaz) turns out to be a gutsy risk-taker and a powerful agent for change among God&#39;s people. She lives outside the box, and her love for Yahweh and Naomi compels her to break the rules of social and religious convention at nearly every turn. Boaz, the Kinsman Redeemer, is repeatedly caught off-guard by Ruth&#39;s initiatives. His partnership with her models the kind of male/female relationships that the gospel intends for all who follow Jesus. Carolyn James drills down deeper into the story where she uncovers in the Old Testament the same passionate, counter-cultural, rule-breaking gospel that Jesus modeled and taught his followers to pursue. Within this age-old story is a map to radical levels of love and sacrifice, combined with the message that God is counting on his daughters to build his kingdom. The Gospel of Ruth vests every woman&#39;s life with kingdom purposes and frees us to embrace wholeheartedly God&#39;s calling, regardless of our circumstances or season of life. This story of two women who have lost everything contains a profound message: God created women not to live in the shadowy margins of men or of the past, but to emerge as courageous activists for his kingdom.</p><p>In a time of transition, Carolyn James found herself haunted by a single question: "Is God good for women?" She felt a tension between her understanding that women are God's image-bearers and a troubling impression that God values the contributions of his sons more than those of his daughters. James sought spiritual answers. And she found them, to her amazement, in the book of Ruth.<br> That seemed counter-intuitive. After all, isn't the story of Ruth about a passive, deferential, submissive woman who "knew her place," and a man who saved the day? Far from it. Delving into recent scholarly work on this important book, Carolyn James uncovers a portrait of a woman who relationship with God mobilized her to the levels of radical living and self-giving love that Jesus modeled and taught his followers. Ruth's break-the-rules brand of faith revives and mobilizes the despondent Naomi and leads Boaz to new levels of godliness. Before the story is over, the three forge an alliance that literally changed the world. This is <i>The Gospel of Ruth</i>.<p> In this story, God reveals his heart for women and teaches important lessons<br> - God never watses pain, but deepens and equips us through suffering<br> - God is counting on his daughters to build his kingdom<br> - God calls men and women to partner together in serving him<br> - Sincere gospel living saturates us with purpose and transforms our relationships</p><p> <i>The Gospel of Ruth</i> reveals the good news of how God can resurrect and transform each woman's life and then use her in the building of his kingdom - and its all woven into the fabic of a moving, ancient, and surprising story.</p>Carolyn Custis James (MA, Biblical Studies) travels extensively as a popular speaker for women&#39;s conferences, churches, colleges, seminaries, and other Christian organizations.

Unlike most books on the subject, it shows the <i>connection</i> between many issues, using current data and a balanced discussion of major perspectives, theories, and models. Begins with an introduction to sociology and the concept of social change; then explores recent changes and trends in contemporary American society; discusses concepts, theories, and models of change with reference to social movements, revolutions, innovation, and the role of change agents as producers of social change; and concludes with a discussion of world-scale trends and change processes in the modern world, with reference to development, globalization, environmental issues, and prospects for the future. For those involved in marketing, policy development, etc.</p><p><p>Charles Harper, Ph.D. is a Professor of Sociology at Creighton University. His academic interests include social change, globalization, religion, environmental sociology, social theory, and food issues. His publications include journal articles related to those interests, and he has published university-level texts including <i>Environment and Society: </i> <i>Human Perspectives on Environmental Issues</i>&nbsp;(2007), <i>Exploring Social Change: America and the World</i> (2006), and <i>Food, Society, and Environment </i>(2007).&nbsp; Professor Harper has been a consultant for many religious and community organizations, and is an active contributor to departmental policy, personnel, and curriculum matters for the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Creighton University. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Environmental Educator Achievement Award, presented by the Nebraska Chapter of the Sierra Club, and the Burlington Northern Award, to the Outstanding Creighton University Scholar of the Year, awarded by the Creighton University Graduate School.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Kevin Leicht, Ph.D. is a Professor of Sociology at the University of Iowa, where he teaches courses in the sociology of work, organizational theory, economy and society, political sociology and social stratification. He has co-authored five books, including Postindustrial Peasants: The Illusion of Middle Class Prosperity (2006), Professional Work (2001), and Current Issues in the Study of Labor Force: Concepts, Measures and Trends (2001). He has contributed chapters and articles to edited works, including the Encyclopedia of Social Theory, and published research articles in journals such as American Journal of Sociology and Law and Society Review. Professor Leicht is Editor of Research in Social Stratification and Mobility, official journal of the Social Stratification Section (RC-28) of the International Sociological Association, Director of the Institute for Inequality Studies and Director of the Social Science Research Center. His current research examines gender inequality among professionals, transaction-cost approaches to career decision-making, the development of economic development programs by the U.S. states, and the causes and consequences of corporate restructuring.</p><p> This is a book for all those who are curious about social change. It is also about how sociologists study change. It is about the substance of social change in the United States and the contemporary world; it is also about the usefulness of sociological ideas for, understanding change and methods of inquiry that have been used to understand social change. We think the topic of social change is of intrinsic interest to everyone, since its pervasive impact is felt by all and is often the cause of considerable perplexity. Sociological perspectives are uniquely suited to illuminate social change because of their holistic treatment of the different aspects of social life that other disciplines (politics, law, economics) address in a more partial way. Sociology is also a lively and contentious discipline, and we have not ignored sociological controversies or omitted complex ideas that defy oversimplification. The book requires some background, but we have tried to write a book for relative newcomers to sociology, avoiding the most arcane jargon and professional idiom for what we hope are clear language and fertile examples. It is about "big" issues, but we have tried to write in a way that engages the life experience of individuals. </p><p> The topics of the book are based on what we think is important to communicate about social change based on years of teaching and thinking about it. Others may not agree. It begins with a synoptic overview of recent change in American society. America here refers to the United States, and when we refer to other Western Hemispheric nations, we will use their proper names, or other terms like North America or Latin America. Middle chapters deal with selected change processes and with sociological theories of change. The later chapters are about global change processes in the modern world. A more descriptive overview of the chapter topics and organization of the book occurs at the end of Chapter 1, so we won't elaborate more here. </p><p> Writing a book involves the minds and energies of many people besides the authors. Harper would like to acknowledge his indebtedness to five teachers who have been particularly influential in his intellectual development: Ray Cuzzort, Ernest Manheim, Oscar Eggers, Jerry Cloyd, and Jack Siegman. He would also like to thank his students and colleagues at Creighton University who put up with him over the years through several editions, especially the diverse contributions of Tom Mans, Sue Crawford, and James T. Ault. Harper also thanks Barbara Braden, Dean of the Creighton University Graduate College, for her material support during the completion of the fourth edition. He also thanks professional colleagues for their support and critical feedback over the years, including Prentice Hall reviewers Gerry Cox of Black Hills State University; David Swift of the University of Hawaii; Mark Mantyh of the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee; and Becky M. Trigg of the University of Alabama, Birmingham. </p><p> Leicht first and foremost owes an immeasurable debt of gratitude to Charles Harper for his capable guidance and friendship over the past twenty years. He also owes a great deal to James T. Ault for taking a Nebraska boy who was a little wet behind the ears and turning him into a productive member of the social science community. When he was offered the opportunity to help with the revision of this text, he jumped at the chance in part because of the experiences he had as an undergraduate at Creighton University. He sincerely hopes that this text inspires others to think critically about the world around them, whether they decide to become sociologists or not. </p><p> We owe a special debt of gratitude to the editorial staff of Prentice Hall, particularly Sharon Chambliss, the supportive and congenial "editor in charge" of the project, and Nancy Roberts, Publisher, who has been a constant source of unobtrusive encouragement and the most human face in a distant corporation. A NOTE TO INSTRUCTORS </p><p> This is a compact but flexibly organized core text that can be used with a wide variety of supplements. Ideas are connected and developmental, but not so tightly that you can't omit some chapters or rearrange the order to fit the priorities of different courses. Here are a few suggestions for some optional ways of organizing the course. </p><p> If you want a more descriptive course about change in America and the world without much theory, you can omit entirely Parts Two and Three about theory, movements, and innovation, though you may have to decode some discussions later on. Another alternative, more consistent with comparative interests, would be to omit the American materials in Part One entirely, begin with the theory material (Parts Two and Three), skip to the material about technology and innovation (Chapter 10), and then continue through material about development, globalization, population/environment issues, and the future (Part Four). Yet another alternative is a more applied emphasis that asks students to observe change processes close up. For that, we would begin with the American materials (Part One), followed with a chapter about movements (Chapter 7), and then with material about innovation and creating change (Chapter 1)&#x2014;ending with other material as you see fit. You can, of course, rearrange the sequence by having students read the theory and change process material first, but based on our teaching experience we don't recommend it. We placed material about change in America first as a means of engaging students before addressing more conceptually demanding issues about theory, models, social movements, and innovation. </p><p> We have retained the review questions at the end of each chapter to help students explore the personal implications of large-scale social change processes and to facilitate discussion. </p><p> We would like to hear about your experience with the book and about improving it. <br></p></p><h2>REALIDADES LEVELED VOCABULARY AND GRMR WORKBOOK (CORE &amp; GUIDED PRACTICE)LEVEL 3 COPYRIGHT 2011</h2><p><p>Combines the current Practice Workbook <em>and</em> the Guided Practice Workbook into one workbook.&nbsp; Now you have a single workbook for all your students!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This workbook provides two levels of support for students.

In middle age, she shook the dust of acceptable society from her shoes and began a passionate journey into the wilderness of British Columbia; the power of her genius made her one of the twentieth century's great painters. Fortunately, she also wrote.

Charles Schwartz&#x2019;s meticulously rendered drawings capture the spirit of his subjects while remaining technically accurate. The drawings range from full portraits to vignettes to illustrations of skulls, tracks, and other identifying characteristics. The enormous popularity of this work as a college textbook and general reference and a desire to contain the most accurate information led to two previous revisions&#x2014;the first (in 1981) edited by both authors and the second (in 2001) edited by Elizabeth Schwartz. Scientists and enthusiasts lost two great conservationists when Charles died in 1991 and Elizabeth in 2013.</p><p>Debby K. Fantz, resource scientist with the Missouri Department of Conservation, and Dr. Victoria L. Jackson, associate professor with the University of Central Oklahoma, have worked to ensure that <i>Wild Mammals</i> will continue to educate, delight, and inspire with this third revised edition. These two mammalogists have over fifty years&#x2019; combined experience conducting surveys and research, leading trapping workshops, designing distribution models, identifying mammals, and teaching courses in mammalogy and wildlife conservation and management.</p><p><i>The Wild Mammals of Missouri</i> has grown from sixty-three full species accounts in the first edition to seventy-two in this third revised edition. The editors have maintained the basic structure of the book while adding much new information, including a full account for the elk with artwork by Mark Raithel, new trapping records, revised common and scientific names, enhanced Missouri county-level distribution information, updated range maps, and a discussion of the range expansions of the American black bear and nine-banded armadillo, as well as the increase in confirmed mountain lion sightings.</p></p><p>Charles W. Schwartz (1914-1991) was with the Missouri Department of Conservation for forty years, serving as biologist, author, wildlife photographer, and wildlife artist. Elizabeth R. Schwartz (1912-2013) was employed with the Department of Conservation for over thirty years as biologist, author, and assistant in wildlife photography. Together this husband-and-wife team has written or illustrated thirteen other books and many technical papers for scientific journals and popular articles for magazines. They have also produced some twenty-four motion pictures and numerous TV programs, which have received both national and international awards. <br><br><p>&#x201c;This scientific yet popular publication by Charles and Elizabeth Schwartz has been widely acclaimed as the definitive work on its subject.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Larry R.

George Orwell's final work is a treasure chest of ideas and memes--Big Brother, the Thought Police, Doublethink, Newspeak, 2+2=5--that gain potency with every year. Particularly in 2016, when the election of Donald Trump made it a bestseller ("Ministry of Alternative Facts," anyone?). Its influence has morphed endlessly into novels (<i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>), films (<i>Brazil</i>), television shows (<i>V for Vendetta</i>), rock albums (<i>Diamond Dogs</i>), commercials (Apple), even reality TV (<i>Big Brother</i>). <i>The Ministry of Truth</i> is the first book that fully examines the epochal and cultural event that is <i>1984</i> in all its aspects: its roots in the utopian and dystopian literature that preceded it; the personal experiences in wartime Great Britain that Orwell drew on as he struggled to finish his masterpiece in his dying days; and the political and cultural phenomena that the novel ignited at once upon publication and that far from subsiding, have only grown over the decades.

What kind of impression did he make? He was around six foot three, with size-twelve feet, large, expressive hands, and gangling limbs that he seemed unsure where to place. He had a pale, gaunt, prematurely worn-out face with deep grooves around the mouth, creating an impression of noble suffering that reminded friends of Don Qui�xote or an El Greco saint. His pale blue eyes conveyed a mournful, compassionate intelligence. His mouth was prone to twists of ironic amusement and, if you were lucky, a rusty growl of laughter. His hair sprouted vertically like the bristles of a brush. He dressed shabbily, his clothes not so much fitting his body as hanging off it, a thin mustache his only concession to neatness. He smelled of burnt tobacco and, some said, an indefinable tang of sickness. He spoke in a dry, rasping monotone whose aspiration to classlessness was thwarted by a stubborn residue of Eton. On first encounter, he could seem standoffish and detached: a dry old stick. Those who got to know him soon unearthed his generosity and good humor but still bumped up against his emotional reserve. He was a firm believer in hard work and modest pleasures. Newly wed, to a bright, bold Oxford graduate named Eileen O&#x2019;Shaughnessy. Politically engaged but not ideological. Well-traveled and multilingual. Going places.<br><br>Just as important are the things he wasn&#x2019;t. He was not yet a major figure, a committed socialist, an expert on totalitarianism, nor a writer whose prose was a window pane. He was barely George Orwell. Spain was to become the great rupture in his life: his zero hour. Years later, he would tell his friend Arthur Koestler, &#x201c;History stopped in 1936.&#x201d; Meaning totalitarianism. Meaning Spain. History stopped, and Nineteen Eighty-Four began.<br><br>&#x201c;Until I was about thirty,&#x201d; Orwell wrote in middle age, &#x201c;I always planned my life on the assumption not only that any major undertaking was bound to fail, but that I could only expect to live a few years longer.&#x201d;<br><br>He was born Eric Arthur Blair in India on June 25, 1903. His mother, Ida, who brought him to England the following year, was a sharply intelligent woman, half-French, who mixed with Suffragettes and Fabians. His father, Richard Blair, was a mid-ranking civil servant for the British imperial government&#x2019;s Opium Department who didn&#x2019;t reenter his son&#x2019;s life until 1912, at which point he appeared &#x201c;simply as a gruff-voiced elderly man forever saying &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t.&#x2019; &#x201d; In Nineteen Eighty-Four, Winston Smith is haunted by his childhood betrayal of his mother and sister, but he can barely remember his father.<br><br>Orwell was thus born into what he called the &#x201c;lower-upper-middle-class,&#x201d; a troubled stratum of the English class system that had the pretensions and manners of the wealthy but not the capital, and therefore spent most of the money it did have on &#x201c;keeping up appearances.&#x201d; He later regarded his younger self, with embarrassment, shame and no small amount of contempt, as the kind of &#x201c;odious little snob&#x201d; that his class and education were designed to breed. &#x201c;Your snobbishness, unless you root it out like the bindweed it is, sticks by you till your grave.&#x201d; Between the ages of eight and thirteen, he was a pupil at St. Cyprian&#x2019;s, a small private school in Sussex that he loathed with alarming passion for the rest of his life. &#x201c;Failure, failure, failure&#x2014;�failure behind me, failure ahead of me&#x2014;�that was by far the deepest conviction that I carried away.&#x201d;<br><br>In the short autobiography that Orwell contributed to Twentieth Century Authors in 1940, he wrote, &#x201c;I was educated at Eton, 1917&#x2013;1921, as I had been lucky enough to win a scholarship, but I did no work there and learned very little, and I don&#x2019;t feel that Eton has been much of a formative influence in my life.&#x201d; While he probably exaggerated the contempt the fee-payers felt for the scholarship boys, it&#x2019;s true that he was a mediocre student with a profound sense of unbelonging. Although he was known as a &#x201c;Bolshie,&#x201d; his alleged socialism was more of a fashionable pose than a deep conviction. One fellow pupil remembered him as &#x201c;a boy with a permanent chip on the shoulder, always liking to find everything around him wrong, and giving the impression that he was there to put it right.&#x201d; Another said, &#x201c;he was more sardonic than rebellious, and standing aside from things a bit, observing&#x2014;�always observing.&#x201d;<br><br>After Eton, Orwell rejected the chance to attend university and joined the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, where his mother had grown up: a surprising decision which he never tried to explain to his readers or friends. Orwell shelved his writing ambitions, but his five years in Burma did furnish him with the material for one decent novel (Burmese Days) and two very good essays (&#x201c;A Hanging&#x201d; and &#x201c;Shooting an Elephant&#x201d;) and a lifelong belief in the value of lived experience. Orwell disliked intellectuals, a word he tended to suspend in scare quotes, who relied on theory and speculation; he never truly believed something until he had, in some way, lived it. &#x201c;In order to hate imperialism you have got to be part of it&#x201d; is a fallacious generalization, but it was true for him. In Orwell&#x2019;s writing, you often meant I.<br><br>Burma functioned as aversion therapy. Through seeing how members of the ruling class were corrupted and confined by their abuse of power and the hypocrisy that cloaked it, Orwell developed a disgust for oppression of every stripe and briefly became a kind of anarchist before deciding that this was &#x201c;sentimental nonsense.&#x201d; He returned to England in 1927 (on leave, but he never went back) with &#x201c;an immense weight of guilt that I had got to expiate.&#x201d; This manifested as a masochistic desire to thrust himself into uncomfortable and even life-threatening situations. &#x201c;How can you write about the poor unless you become poor yourself, even if it&#x2019;s temporary?&#x201d; he asked a friend. A librarian who met him during this period astutely noticed that he was a man &#x201c;in the process of rearranging himself.&#x201d;<br><br>With, by his own admission, &#x201c;no interest in Socialism or any other economic theory,&#x201d; he sought to submerge himself in the netherworld of the oppressed&#x2014;�those who, by having no jobs, property or status whatsoever, had transcended, or rather sunk below, the class system&#x2014;�by becoming a tramp in England and a dishwasher in Paris in the late 1920s. &#x201c;It is a sort of world-within-a-world where everyone is equal, a small squalid democracy&#x2014;�perhaps the nearest thing to democracy that exists in England,&#x201d; he wrote. Richard Rees, editor of The Adelphi, thought that Orwell chose this path &#x201c;as a kind of penance or ablution to wash himself clean of the taint of imperialism.&#x201d; This nostalgie de la boue, which foreshadowed Winston Smith&#x2019;s expeditions into the prole district in Nineteen Eighty-Four, led him to write his first book, the memoir Down and Out in Paris and London.<br><br>Published in 1933, the book marked the birth of &#x201c;George Orwell.&#x201d; One reason he gave for using a pseudonym was a desire to spare his family any embarrassment if the book&#x2019;s contents shocked them, or if his career as a writer fizzled out, but then he always disliked the name Eric and was hungry for reinvention. Taken from the River Orwell in Suffolk, this quintessentially English name squeezed out his alternative ideas, Kenneth Miles, P. S. Burton and H. Lewis Allways. And a good job, too: Allwaysian would not have been a graceful adjective.<br><br>By 1936, Orwell was the author of three novels, one nonfiction book, a few weak poems, and a trickle-to-a-stream of journalism, all of which did not yet add up to a viable career. He could only keep his head above water by taking on work as a teacher and a bookseller. That year, he painted a grimly exaggerated self-portrait in his third novel, Keep the Aspidistra Flying. Gordon Comstock is a hard-up fugitive from the &#x201c;shabby-genteel&#x201d; middle classes who nurses unfulfilled literary ambitions and works in a bookshop to make ends meet. He is &#x201c;not thirty yet, but moth-eaten already. Very pale, with bitter, ineradicable lines.&#x201d; His self-pity, pessimism and misanthropy are so claustrophobic that his final surrender to the bourgeois conformity symbolized by the aspidistra house plant comes as a merciful release. Comstock is a gargoyle of Orwell: the man he might have become had he succumbed to bitterness and gloom.<br><br>In January 1936, Orwell accepted a commission from his publisher Victor Gollancz, a bullish, energetic Jewish socialist, to explore the plight of the industrial working class in the north of England. Published the following year, Part I of The Road to Wigan Pier is a sterling example of campaigning journalism, eliciting the reader&#x2019;s empathy by interleaving hard data with a vivid sense of the sights, sounds, tastes and smells of working-class life. The image of a woman kneeling to unclog a waste pipe struck Orwell as such an indelible tableau of drudgery that he restaged it years later in Nineteen Eighty-Four. He was captured by the look on her face: &#x201c;She knew well enough what was happening to her.&#x201d; Orwell wrote frequently about the power of the face to reveal personality in a profound way, whether it was Dickens, Hitler, a Spanish militiaman or Big Brother. In Airstrip One, Nineteen Eighty-Four&#x2019;s version of Britain, the danger of physically betraying one&#x2019;s true feelings is called &#x201c;facecrime,&#x201d; and the torturer O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s metaphor for tyranny, is &#x201c;a boot stamping on a human face&#x2014;�for ever.&#x201d;<br><br>Although he seriously downplays the pleasures of working-class life in order to emphasize the hardships, in Part I of The Road to Wigan Pier Orwell gives his subjects their due as human beings, not merely statistical units or emblems of the struggling masses. So when he told the working-class writer Jack Common, &#x201c;I am afraid I have made rather a muck of parts of it,&#x201d; he presumably meant the more essayistic Part II, which he later said wasn&#x2019;t worth reprinting.<br><br>The opening stretch of Part II is a kind of memoir, tracing the evolution of his political consciousness with punishing honesty. By saying that he was trained from birth to &#x201c;hate, fear and despise the working class,&#x201d; he implicitly makes the book a means of both education and penance. The rest, however, is a confused polemic. Orwell thought that if socialism was clearly necessary, then its unpopularity must be down to its image, which &#x201c;drives away the very people who ought to be flocking to its support&#x201d; by obscuring its fundamental ideals of justice, liberty and common decency. He identifies two major obstacles. One is socialism&#x2019;s cult of the machine, which creates an unappetizing vision of &#x201c;aeroplanes, tractors and huge glittering factories of glass and concrete.&#x201d; The other is middle-class crankishness. Barely noting the existence of working-class socialists or the trade union movement, Orwell launders his own eccentric prejudices through the imagined mindset of the common man, excoriating all the fetishes and foibles that allegedly make socialism unattractive to them (i.e., him), including vegetarians, teetotallers, nudists, Quakers, sandals, fruit juice, Marxist jargon, the word comrade, pistachio-colored shirts, birth control, yoga, beards and Welwyn Garden City, the Hertfordshire town custom-built on utopian principles. Although Orwell claims in the book that he is only playing devil&#x2019;s advocate, it is hard to escape the feeling that he has more fun insulting a kooky minority of socialists than defending other forms of socialism. After such a performance, for him to conclude the book by calling for &#x201c;left-wingers of all complexions to drop their differences and hang together&#x201d; is a bit rich.<br><br>Orwell made life difficult for Victor Gollancz, who had recently founded the Left Book Club with the Labor MP John Strachey and the political scientist Harold Laski in order to promote socialism. Laski, Britain&#x2019;s most influential socialist intellectual, called Part I of The Road to Wigan Pier &#x201c;admirable propaganda for our ideas&#x201d; but Gollancz felt compelled to write a preface to the Left Book Club edition which distanced the club from the harsh judgments of Part II. In the preface, Gollancz put his finger on Orwell&#x2019;s torturously paradoxical nature: &#x201c;The truth is that he is at one and the same time an extreme intellectual and a violent anti-intellectual. Similarly he is a frightful snob&#x2014;�still (he must forgive me for saying this), and a genuine hater of every form of snobbery.&#x201d; Until the end of his life, Orwell acknowledged that microbes of everything he criticized existed in himself. In fact, it was this awareness of his own flaws that inoculated him against utopian delusions of human perfectibility.<br><br>Gollancz also accused Orwell of never defining his preferred version of socialism, nor explaining how it might come about. According to Orwell&#x2019;s bookshop colleague and subsequent editor Jon Kimche, Orwell was a &#x201c;gut socialist&#x201d;: &#x201c;very decent but not attuned, I would say, to complicated political or military situations.&#x201d; Yet however patchy and perverse his critique of socialism may have been, Orwell&#x2019;s intentions were sincere. He believed that &#x201c;nothing else can save us from the misery of the present or the nightmare of the future,&#x201d; and if it failed to persuade ordinary Britons, then their discontent would surely be exploited by someone like Hitler. Socialism in Britain, he wrote, &#x201c;smells of crankishness, machine-worship and the stupid cult of Russia. Unless you can remove that smell, and very rapidly, Fascism may win.&#x201d;<br><br>Even as he wrote those words, Orwell was making plans to fight fascism more directly. Adelphi editor Richard Rees had known Orwell since 1930, but it was only when his friend went to Spain that Rees &#x201c;began to realize he was extraordinary.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Spanish Civil War is one of the comparatively few cases when the most widely accepted version of events has been written more persuasively by the losers of the conflict than by the winners,&#x201d; wrote the historian Antony Beevor. What&#x2019;s more, the most widely read memoir of the conflict, Orwell&#x2019;s Homage to Catalonia, was written by a man who fought with the losers of the losers: the Partido Obrero de Unificaci�n Marxista (Workers&#x2019; Party of Marxist Unification), known as the POUM. That is a very particular point of view. The POUM were small in size and influence, militarily weak and politically unpopular. So when contemporaries and, later, historians claimed that Orwell&#x2019;s book gave a distorted picture of the war, they were not wrong, but it did tell the truth about Orwell&#x2019;s war.</p><h2>Sell Like Crazy: How To Get As Many Clients, Customers and Sales As You Can Possibly Handle</h2><p>In what some are calling the most controversial marketing book of the decade, Sell Like Crazy reveals an 8-phase selling system for generating absurd amounts of leads, sales and profit for any business in any market! <br> <br> If you're tired of struggling to make online marketing work... <br> Sick of throwing money down the drain with PPC advertising... <br> Or want to create a torrential downpour of clients for your business. <br> Then THIS will be the most important book you EVER read. <br> Sabri Suby, (founder of King Kong, Australia's fastest growing digital agency) is finally revealing the system he's used to go from $0 to $10m+ in annual revenue... <br> And make over $400m in sales for his clients - in 4 years flat! <br> FULL DISCLOSURE: This book is NOT for the faint of heart... <br> If you want the same old rehashed advice from 'experts' who couldn't sell water in the desert...<br> Then this book is NOT for you. <br> However, if you want to FINALLY discover what's working online... <br> Get the battle-hardened tactics King Kong are using RIGHT NOW... <br> And outsell your competition so you can CRUSH them into a fine powder... <br> Then 'Sell Like Crazy' will change your business life forever. <br> Here's a glimpse of what Sabri reveals in this revolutionary book: <br> 1.

"I believe that you pray to it when you are unhappy. Men made it, do not forget that."'</b></p><p>E.M. Forster is best known for his exquisite novels, but these two affecting short stories brilliantly combine the fantastical with the allegorical.

He is known best for his ironic and well-plotted novels examining class difference and hypocrisy in early 20th-century British society. Forster's humanistic impulse toward understanding and sympathy may be aptly summed up in the epigraph to his 1910 novel Howards End: "Only connect." Forster was gay, but this fact was not made public during his lifetime.

First he is "hopping mad," but expert Hare informs him that he is not hopping properly and shows him the correct moves. On the animated spreads that follow, Bear, Bobcat, and Hedgehog demonstrate how to be "stomping," "screaming," and "rolling-around-on-the ground" mad. However, each time Mouse tries to imitate them, he finds himself sprawled in a mud puddle. It is not until he is "standing-still mad" and none of the others can best his motionless stance that he begins to feel better.

Just like the heroine in Molly Bang's <i>When Sophie Gets Angry&#x2014;Really, Really Angry</i>...

It was the right sentiment, perhaps, in an age of imperial rivalry but today many Americans doubt the utility of their global military presence, thinking it outdated, unnecessary or even dangerous.<br><br>In <i>The Big Stick</i>, Eliot A. Cohen-a scholar and practitioner of international relations-disagrees. He argues that hard power remains essential for American foreign policy. While acknowledging that the US must be careful about why, when, and how it uses force, he insists that its international role is as critical as ever, and armed force is vital to that role. <br><br>Cohen explains that American leaders must learn to use hard power in new ways and for new circumstances. The rise of a well-armed China, Russia's conquest of Crimea and eastern Ukraine, nuclear threats from North Korea and Iran, and the spread of radical Islamist movements like ISIS are some of the key threats to global peace. If the United States relinquishes its position as a strong but prudent military power, and fails to accept its role as the guardian of a stable world order we run the risk of unleashing disorder, violence and tyranny on a scale not seen since the 1930s.

At the same time adjacent portions of philosophy and logic are discussed. To the existence of what objects may a given scientific theory be said to be committed? And what considerations may suitably guide us in accepting or revising such ontological commitments? These are among the questions dealt with in this book, particular attention being devoted to the role of abstract entities in mathematics. There is speculation on the mechanism whereby objects of one sort or another come to be posited, a process in which the notion of identity plays an important part.</p><p>Several of these essays have been printed whole in journals; others are in varying degrees new. Two main themes run through them. One is the problem of meaning, particularly as involved in the notion of an analytic statement. The other is the notion of ontological, commitment, particularly as involved in the problem of universals.W. V. Quine was Edgar Pierce Professor of Philosophy, Harvard University. He wrote twenty-one books, thirteen of them published by Harvard University Press.</p><h2>Hidden in Christ: Living as God&#39;s Beloved (Apprentice)</h2><p><strong>A Deeper Sort of Devotional</strong> Words are powerful. They contain ideas and shape the way we see God, ourselves and all of reality. We're transformed, in particular, by God's Word, and by "the Word," the Logos&#x2015;Jesus himself&#x2015;as described by John in the first chapter of his Gospel. Memorizing and studying a passage in depth can offer a deeper sense of the meaning of each word. In this unique introduction to the hidden life in Christ, James Bryan Smith walks readers through a thirty-day immersion in Colossians 3:1-17. Each of the thirty short chapters of this book bring out the main truth of just one word or phrase of this rich passage. You'll also find a very simple daily practice to take up, reflection questions and a guide for five weeks of group discussion. The chapters are short in length, making this book an ideal daily devotional. Since there are thirty chapters, it could be used for a one-month introduction to the hidden life in Christ. Though brief in terms of length, each chapter tries to unearth some very deep truths. For those who have read and practiced the exercises in the Apprentice series, this book will be a helpful refresher as you continue your sacred journey. Each chapter also contains an exercise or practice ("Living into the Truth"), as well as an affirmation that summarizes the main point of the chapter and a written prayer designed to move you deeper into the truths of the Word. In addition, each chapter concludes with a few reflection questions that can be used either by individuals or in a group discussion. The only way to tell a story is to use words. May the words of Colossians 3 become a companion to you as God continues to write your story.</p><p>"Much of our spirituality is a mile long and an inch deep. James Bryan Smith helps us go deeper. This book is based on one chapter of the Bible, and it is a dazzling one.

James Hogg's sardonic novel follows a young man who, falling under the spell of a mysterious stranger who bears an uncanny likeness to himself, embarks on a career as a serial murderer. The memoirs are presented by a narrator whose attempts to explain the story only succeed in intensifying its more baffling and bizarre aspects. Is the young man the victim of a psychotic delusion, or has he been tempted by the devil to wage war against God's enemies? The authoritative and lively introduction by Ian Duncan covers the full range of historical and religious themes and contexts, offers a richer and more accurate consideration of the novel's relation to Romantic fiction than found elsewhere, and sheds new light on the novel's treatment of fanaticism. Copious notes identify the novel's historical, biblical, theological, and literary allusions.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

They succeeded. Under the expert management of eminent classicists David Grene and Richmond Lattimore, those translations combined accuracy, poetic immediacy, and clarity of presentation to render the surviving masterpieces of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides in an English so lively and compelling that they remain the standard translations. Today, Chicago is taking pains to ensure that our Greek tragedies remain the leading English-language versions throughout the twenty-first century.</p> <p> </p> <p>In this highly anticipated third edition, Mark Griffith and Glenn W. Most have carefully updated the translations to bring them even closer to the ancient Greek while retaining the vibrancy for which our English versions are famous. This edition also includes brand-new translations of Euripides&#x2019; <i>Medea</i>, <i>The Children of Heracles</i>, <i>Andromache</i>, and <i>Iphigenia among the Taurians</i>, fragments of lost plays by Aeschylus, and the surviving portion of Sophocles&#x2019;s satyr-drama <i>The Trackers</i>. New introductions for each play offer essential information about its first production, plot, and reception in antiquity and beyond. In addition, each volume includes an introduction to the life and work of its tragedian, as well as notes addressing textual uncertainties and a glossary of names and places mentioned in the plays.</p> <p> </p> <p>In addition to the new content, the volumes have been reorganized both within and between volumes to reflect the most up-to-date scholarship on the order in which the plays were originally written. The result is a set of handsome paperbacks destined to introduce new generations of readers to these foundational works of Western drama, art, and life.</p></p><p><b>Mark Griffith</b> is a professor of classics and of theater, dance, and performance studies at the University of California, Berkeley.

Later she would tell that to anyone who would listen: police, reporters, lawyers, her parents, her boyfriend, her dealer, the new bartender with the knuckle tattoos at Schultz&#x2019;s, the investigator from California and her partner, and her own reflection in the bathroom mirror, right before cracking her forehead on the sink&#x2019;s edge and passing out from the cocktail of pain, grief, and fear.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was not a bad mother, even though she&#x2019;d yelled at them that morning. It was Saturday, finally, and Jamie was embarrassed to say sometimes she liked the weekdays more, the predictable rhythm of her aunt Maggie&#x2019;s real estate office where she was the receptionist, the chance to drink coffee and read <i>Us </i>magazine online, thinking of the girls in school, which they actually liked for the most part. Kylie, the ten-year-old, might piss and moan over homework, but she loved the day-to-day operations of school&#x2014;the hurricane of note passing and gossip. She was already popular, had already stolen makeup from Jamie&#x2019;s top dresser drawer and sent texts to boys from Jamie&#x2019;s phone. Bailey, eight, was just as sassy but loved school for the school part, read�ing and writing&#x2014;especially vocabulary, the way words sounded and the rules that went with them.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The weekends were hectic, a blur of soccer games and ballet prac�tice, playdates and every last minute crammed with errands: grocer�ies, cooking, pharmacy (Kylie&#x2019;s allergies, Bailey&#x2019;s asthma), cleaning the apartment, dusting and Swiffering every surface to avoid allergies and asthma. And then meltdowns and screaming protests about the rules: one hour on the computer for non-school-related activities, half an hour of video games, one hour of TV, all of which would be broken by Sunday night. Jamie would have to beg them to go to the housing com�plex playground, which the girls claimed was old, dirty, with two out of five swings broken and a sandbox that smelled like pee.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All Jamie wanted was to get to Saturday night. Then Darrell would come over and maybe the girls would go somewhere for a sleepover, or to Nana and Papa&#x2019;s. Maybe Jamie would let them play video games for a bonus hour in their room and take pictures with her phone just so she and Darrell could drink some beers and watch a movie that didn&#x2019;t feature a chipmunk or a princess. And if the girls weren&#x2019;t there, maybe they&#x2019;d smoke a joint; maybe his hand would slide up her shirt and they&#x2019;d end up naked on the couch, Jamie looking at him on top, thinking he is not perfect, he has funny teeth and always wears that leather jacket with the hole in the pit, but there are a few good qualities here. One large good quality: she would think and then she&#x2019;d laugh, and Darrell would say, &#x201c;What?&#x201d; but then he&#x2019;d laugh too.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But first, errands and then a birthday party for all of them. It was for a girl in Kylie&#x2019;s class, but it was one of those parties to which every�one was invited&#x2014;siblings and parents for pizza, games, and cake in the family&#x2019;s big ranch-style house in a new development called The Knolls. Jamie didn&#x2019;t like the trend, these big free-for-all events, was worried because Kylie&#x2019;s birthday was in June and maybe she&#x2019;d want the same thing. Jamie saw the problems coming at her like headlights: their apartment was too small for a party, her mother would never let her hear the end of it if she asked to have it at her parents&#x2019; place, and the money, all that money, for that many pizzas plus gifts plus a new dress for Kylie and the new dress Bailey would have to have too.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Why do you guys even have to come in?&#x201d; said Kylie from the pas�senger side, eyebrows wrinkled up over her big hot-cocoa eyes, a sneer in her angel lips.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Fine, we&#x2019;ll wait outside in the car,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Everyone will see us,&#x201d; said Bailey from the backseat, anxious.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie looked in the rearview, taking in Bailey&#x2019;s face, a palette of worry. How can she care so much about what other people think already? thought Jamie. She didn&#x2019;t want the girls to care; she missed the days when they were too little to worry about appearances or be embarrassed, back when they would streak like hippies before jumping into the tub.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not waiting in the car, Kylie,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;Hey&#x2014;won&#x2019;t Stella Piper be there with her family? Bailey can play with Owen.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the corner of her eye Jamie saw her shrug, and felt the weight of it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not friends anymore,&#x201d; said Bailey.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not?&#x201d; Jamie said to Bailey. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not?&#x201d; she said to Kylie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t you shut up?&#x201d; Kylie said, craning her head around the seat to glare at her sister.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Mom!&#x201d; shouted Bailey, pointing.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I heard it, Bailey.&#x201d; To Kylie: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk like that to your sister. Why aren&#x2019;t you friends with Stella Piper anymore?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another shrug.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;She thinks Stella&#x2019;s dumb. And her glasses are funny,&#x201d; Bailey reported. &#x201c;She says they make her look like a creature.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;She&#x2019;s been your friend forever, since you were in kindergarten,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; said Kylie, hushed and hissing.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie stopped third in a trail of cars at a light and said, &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t be mean to someone just because they look funny.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kylie stared out the window.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Someday someone might think you look funny, and then how&#x2019;ll you like it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kylie kept staring.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; Jamie took Kylie&#x2019;s chin in her hand and turned her head. &#x201c;Well?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t like it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie let go and looked up to see a policeman directing all the cars in her lane to the left.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this now?&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bailey looked up over the seat.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What is it? What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, for God&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She pulled up even with the cop and rolled down the window.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I need to go straight ahead to the Gulf on Branford.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Branford? That side of the highway&#x2019;s closed for the parade, Miss,&#x201d; said the cop.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Fuck me,&#x201d; Jamie said, remembering.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Spring Fest. The town&#x2019;s annual parade of toilet-paper-covered floats and high school bands slogging their way through &#x201c;My Girl.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Mom!&#x201d; the kids shouted, embarrassed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well, Officer, I&#x2019;m about to run outta gas, so what do you recommend?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cop leaned into her window.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Tell you what, I&#x2019;ll wave you through to St. Cloud; then you can take a right to Route 1080 and you can get to the Hess over that way.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie pictured the route in her head and nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;d be just great, thanks.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No problem, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; said the cop, tapping the roof of the car.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie drove the path laid out for her by the cop.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you said the f-curse to the police,&#x201d; said Kylie, a look of quiet shame on her face.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m full of surprises,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Can we go past the parade? Miss Ferno&#x2019;s on a float from her church,&#x201d; said Bailey.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What? No, we&#x2019;re already late for this thing,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She glanced at both of them. They stared out the window. Someday you&#x2019;ll think I&#x2019;m funny, she thought. Someday you&#x2019;ll tell your friends, No, my mom&#x2019;s cool. Once she said &#x201c;Fuck me&#x201d; right in front of a cop.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, when they got to the Hess, Kylie asked, &#x201c;Can we split a Reese&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had yet to outgrow an unwavering devotion to sugar&#x2014;she would pour maple syrup over Frosted Flakes if you turned your head the other way.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No, you&#x2019;re going to have all kinds of crap at this party; you don&#x2019;t need a Reese&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then the wailing began&#x2014;you&#x2019;d think someone was pricking their cuticles with sewing needles. Jamie held her head and leaned over the wheel, thinking she should have smoked the very last bit of resin in the pipe this morning. She didn&#x2019;t like to drive stoned, but there wasn&#x2019;t enough in there to mess her up proper, just enough to help her push through, get to the party where it might be acceptable to have a light beer at noon. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Enough, stop it!&#x201d; yelled Jamie, feeling her voice crack, the muscles in her neck tense up. &#x201c;Fine, go get a goddamn Reese&#x2019;s. Get me a coffee with a Splenda, please.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She threw a five in Kylie&#x2019;s lap.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Go before I change my mind,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girls unbuckled their seat belts and scrambled out of the car. Jamie watched them run into the mini-mart, heard the clicks of their dress-up shoes. She checked her makeup in the mirror and shook her head at herself, then went out to the pumps.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She continued to shake her head, thought, Jesus Christ, do I ever sound like her&#x2014;her own mother, Gail&#x2014;&#x201c;Before I change my mind&#x201d; and all those threats. First you swear you&#x2019;ll never be like your mother; then you find yourself sending them to their room and grounding them, and occasionally, once in a while, you hit them once or twice too hard on the back after they say something rude.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie got back in the car and blew air into her hands. Spring Fest my ass, she thought. It was the end of March and still freezing in the mornings and at night, although they&#x2019;d had more than a few hazy warm days the past two months that fooled everyone into thinking spring was really here; even the black cherry trees were confused&#x2014;fruit had prematurely formed on the branches, then iced over and broke off the next week in a storm.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girls had been in the store a long time.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie looked at the time on her phone. 11:32 a.m. They still had to go to Kmart for a gift for Kylie&#x2019;s friend, which meant they would argue about the under-ten-dollar rule, then engage in negotiations until they got to an under-ten-dollar-without-tax agreement. If there was time, maybe Jamie could browse for something for her aunt Maggie, whose birthday was coming up. Maggie was fond of her, and Jamie didn&#x2019;t really know why&#x2014;maybe because she admired Jamie&#x2019;s pluck, maybe because she&#x2019;d been a single mother herself after Uncle Stu had left her for a girl in a massage parlor twenty years ago, and she knew how rough it was. Maybe because it was a way to piss off her sister, Jamie&#x2019;s mother, which she enjoyed doing for a list of reasons either one would tell you all about if you asked them. Jamie ultimately didn&#x2019;t care about the details since Aunt Maggie had cleaned up in the divorce and got her real estate agent&#x2019;s license in short order, owned half a dozen homes in the Poconos that she rented out to vacationers, and brokered deals between buyers and the new developments surrounding Denville.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Goddammit,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She got out of the car and jogged into the mini-mart, scanned the inside quickly and saw only one other person&#x2014;a man, looking at a porn magazine.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; she said to the fat boy behind the counter. He seemed too old for the braces on his teeth.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He jumped.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You see two girls in here?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah. They went to the bathroom in back.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie did not say thank you, walked past the guy with the porn and out the back door. She saw Kylie leaning against the cinder block wall, holding a Reese&#x2019;s cup between her thumb and forefinger like a teacup.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What the hell, Kylie?&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;She had to pee. She said it was an emergency.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie stormed past, rapped on the bathroom door and said, &#x201c;Bailey, come on, let&#x2019;s move it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m washing my hands,&#x201d; said Bailey from inside.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re done. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying not to touch anything.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie almost smiled. She had been trying to teach them to line the toilet seat with paper towels, hover above the bowl, and turn the faucets on and off with their elbows in public bathrooms.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I have Purell in the car. Come on.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened and Bailey came out. She looked at her mother and covered her mouth with her hands.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We forgot the coffee!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They went back to the car and drove to the Ridgewood Mall without speaking, Kylie staring out the window, Bailey reading her school work�book. Jamie glanced at both of them and thought they looked nice. Bai�ley in a pink princess dress, Kylie in a black dress with a purple flower print and the sweetheart neckline that was a little too old for her, Jamie thought, but since it was a hand-me-down from her cousin, she could not complain. They are both so big, she thought, which makes me so old.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The parking lot was surprisingly not crowded, the first three or four rows of the grid full but that was it. God bless Spring Fest, Jamie thought.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So what does Arianna want?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t we coming in?&#x201d; said Kylie, shocked.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No way. I&#x2019;m going in and out.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Come on. That&#x2019;s so unfair!&#x201d; they both said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Deal with it,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;What does she like?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kylie sighed. &#x201c;She wants a sleeping bag.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not buying her a sleeping bag. Does she like jewelry?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kylie nodded.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Great. I&#x2019;ll get her some bracelets.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie looked through her purse for her phone and her wallet, left the key in the ignition so the heat would stay on.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Can we at least listen to music?&#x201d; said Kylie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, you can. I&#x2019;ll be back in five minutes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie got out and was about to slam the door when Bailey said, &#x201c;Mom?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked up from her book and said, &#x201c;Do you know you call a group of lions a pride, not a pack?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie stared at her, then at Kylie, who rolled her eyes.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No, baby, I didn&#x2019;t know that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shut the door and left them.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Into the calm, controlled air of Kmart, pop music from ten years ago in her ears, she forced herself to stay focused. If she didn&#x2019;t have a list, she had trouble concentrating in big box stores, got distracted by displays and sales. That was the point, wasn&#x2019;t it, she thought, to turn you into a kid again who sees something shiny and wants it.

In 1930, he went to live in Paris and for the next ten years he mingled with impoverished expatriates and bohemian Parisians. His first published book, Tropic of Cancer appeared in 1934 published by the Obelisk Press in Paris. It was followed five years later by its sister volume Tropic of Capricorn. Sexually explicit, these books electrified the European literary avant-garde and were almost universally banned outside France. In 1961, after an epic legal battle, Tropic of Cancer was finally published in the US (and then in England in 1963). Miller became a household name, hailed by the Sixties counter-culture as a prophet of freedom and sexual revolution. He died on June 7 1980.&#39;A ranting, randy book carried along by a deep, sensual enjoyment of living.&#39; Sunday Times &#39;Tropic of Cancer is a great prophetic book, a warning of what deadens life, an affirmation that it can yet be lived in an age whose sterile non-cultures seek to thwart all mainsprings of fertility. Miller reveals himself as a battered faun, a crafty innocent, a lonely, lazy, sometimes fearful, always steadfast, worshipper of life&#39; Spectator</p><h2>Emily&#39;s Quest (Emily, No 3)</h2><p>Emily Starr and Teddy Kent have been friends since childhood, and as Teddy is about to leave to further his education as an artist, Emily believes that their friendship is blossoming into something more. On his last night at home, they vow to think of each other when they see the star Vega of the Lyre. As Emily grows as a writer and learns to deal with the loneliness of having her closest friends gone, life at New Moon changes. Mr. Carpenter, Emily&#39;s most truthful critic and favorite teacher dies (warning Emily, even as he dies to &#34;Beware --- of --- italics.&#34;). She becomes closer to Dean Priest, even as she fears he wants love when she only has friendship to give. Worst of all, Emily and Teddy become distant as he focuses on building his career and she hides her feelings behind pride.</p><p>Emily knows she&#39;s going to be a great writer. She also knows that she and her childhood sweetheart, Teddy Kent, will conquer the world together. But when Teddy leaves home to pursue his goal to become an artist at the School of Design in Montreal, Emily&#39;s world collapses. With Teddy gone, Emily agrees to marry a man she doesn&#39;t love ... as she tries to banish all thoughts of Teddy. In her heart, Emily must search for what being a writer really means....The third and final volume of Lucy Maud Montgomery's celebrated Emily trilogy, <i>Emily's Quest</i> is a vigorously drawn study of a woman coming to terms with love and her own ambition. In no other novel did Montgomery explore more fully the beauty, complexity, and wonder of love. In every detail, this mature novel, by one of the world's best-loved authors, captures the drama and confusion of a young life on the brink.<p>Along with <i>Emily of New Moon</i> and <i>Emily Climbs</i>, <i>Emily's Quest</i> is an honest and poignant portrait of a singular woman.</p></p><h2>Becoming Dr. Seuss: Theodor Geisel and the Making of an American Imagination</h2><p><b>The definitive, fascinating, all-reaching biography of Dr. Seuss<br></b><br> Dr. Seuss is a classic American icon. Whimsical and wonderful, his work has defined our childhoods and the childhoods of our own children. The silly, simple rhymes are a bottomless well of magic, his illustrations timeless favorites because, quite simply, he makes us laugh. The Grinch, the Cat in the Hat, Horton, and so many more, are his troupe of beloved, and uniquely Seussian, creations.<br><br> Theodor Geisel, however, had a second, more radical side. It is there that the allure and fasciation of his Dr. Seuss alter ego begins. He had a successful career as an advertising man and then as a political cartoonist, his personal convictions appearing, not always subtly, throughout his books&#x2014;remember the environmentalist of <i>The Lorax</i>? Geisel was a complicated man on an important mission. He introduced generations to the wonders of reading while teaching young people about empathy and how to treat others well. <br><br> Agonizing over word choices and rhymes, touching up drawings sometimes for years, he upheld a rigorous standard of perfection for his work. Geisel took his responsibility as a writer for children seriously, talking down to no reader, no matter how small. And with classics like <i>Green Eggs and Ham, </i>and <i>One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish, </i>Geisel delighted them while they learned. Suddenly, reading became fun.&nbsp; <br><br> Coming right off the heels of&nbsp;<i>George Lucas </i>and bestselling <i>Jim Henson, </i>Brian Jay Jones is quickly developing a reputation as a master biographer of the creative geniuses of our time.&nbsp; <br> <b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Brian Jay Jones</b>&nbsp;is the critically acclaimed, bestselling&nbsp;biographer of&nbsp;three books on some of the world&#x2019;s most iconic creative figures, including&nbsp;<i>Jim Henson: The Biography</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>George Lucas: A Life</i>.

It's just another residential street on the city map of Springfield, Massachusetts, a slightly bent capital letter L lying on its back, not much more than a pass-through between the busier streets of Union and Maple. The street itself is quiet and relatively nondescript, with very little indication that it's a major destination on a map of the American imagination.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But sure enough, it was here-at least as told in the tale by Springfield's own Dr. Seuss-that a little boy named Marco used his imagination to transform a simple horse and wagon into a colorful spectacle, with a brass band pulled by an elephant-riding sultan, flanked by motorcycle policemen and confetti-dumping airplanes, while enthusiastically being reviewed by the top-hatted mayor and the town aldermen. Modern-day pilgrims still flock to Mulberry Street, slowly trolling the neighborhood, windows down, hoping to catch a glimpse of something-anything-that inspired the magnificent imaginations of Marco and Dr. Seuss. Residents smile knowingly, pausing over lawn mowers and trunks still filled with groceries to answer the same question from visiting wayfarers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Where did Dr. Seuss live?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer, it seems, is as disappointing as discovering London's 221B Baker Street is actually home to a bank, and never was home to Sherlock Holmes. Dr. Seuss didn't live on Mulberry Street at all. Instead, pilgrims are directed to another spot on the map, another inverted L about two miles south: Fairfield Street. This is where Dr. Seuss grew up, and the house he lived in for nearly twenty years, at number 74, is still there, looking much as it did during his lifetime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Parts of Springfield, in fact, look as they did during Dr. Seuss's day-or at least the places that shaped his imagination and influenced his art can still be seen if one knows where to look. A few blocks from Fairfield on Howard Street stands the old armory. Its curved stone turrets are reflected in the castles populating so many Seuss books. Over in Forest Park, the Barney Mausoleum-built with a family fortune earned by inventing and selling clamp-on ice skates-looms two stories above the pavement, with the curving staircases and pillared archways that would show up in The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins. And the nearby Forest Park Zoo? That was where "[I tried to] draw the animals," said Dr. Seuss later. "I didn't know how to draw, so they'd come out strange."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Seuss didn't produce Springfield's only creations. Founded by the Puritan William Pynchon in 1636 on a high bluff overlooking the Connecticut River, Springfield has been nurturing and stirring American imaginations for nearly three hundred years. American independence was won with the reliable ammunition and gun carriages produced at the Springfield Armory beginning in 1777. (A decade later, Daniel Shays-spouting a different kind of idealism-would attempt to steal muskets and ammunition from the same armory in a thwarted attempt to overthrow the government of Massachusetts.) By 1795, Springfield Armory would regularly be producing the muskets that would be carried on the shoulders of American soldiers all the way through the War of 1812 and on into the Civil War.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Weaponry wasn't Springfield's only specialty; true, local businessmen Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson, who developed the firearms company that bore their last names, had roots in the town-but so, too, did Charles Goodyear, who discovered and patented the process for making vulcanized rubber in a small Springfield factory in 1844. A year earlier, two industrious Springfield publishers, brothers Charles and George Merriam, acquired the rights to publish Noah Webster's An American Dictionary of the English Language, marking the founding of another iconic American brand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was Milton Bradley, who would launch the American board game industry by cranking out the earliest incarnations of The Game of Life in his lithography studio in 1860. Over on State Street, the beloved and reliable Indian motorcycles would roll out of the company's Springfield factory from 1901 until 1953. Even modern sports would find their origins in the town when in 1891 a Canadian-born physical education teacher named James Naismith, looking to keep his classes occupied through the long, cold Massachusetts winters, mounted a peach basket on a ten-foot pole in the gymnasium at the International YMCA Training School and-opting not to name the game after himself-christened the new game basketball.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Springfield, then, could unequivocally and rightly stake a claim as a major landmark on the frontier of American inventiveness and imagination. Dr. Seuss himself was a construct of one of those unique American minds: a comfortable coat regularly shrugged on and off at will by one of Springfield's most famous sons, Theodor Seuss Geisel. The dropped e at the end of Theodor would forever perplex journalists and copyeditors, but to Theodor-Dr. Seuss himself-it wouldn't much matter. Everyone would always call him Ted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Theodor Seuss Geisel could trace his roots back to the German town of M&#x178;hlhausen, a tiny village squatting on the western shore of a hairpin turn in the Enz River, in what is now the German state of Baden-W&#x178;rttemberg. It was here, in 1650, that Joseph Geissel married Catharina Loth; the extra s would be dropped in later generations, and well before Ted�s grandfather was born in July 1844. Born Theodor Adolph Geisel in M&#x178;lhausen, T. A. Geisel moved to nearby Pforzheim at age fourteen to enter into a six-year apprenticeship with a local jeweler. From there, he joined the German cavalry-T. A. Geisel would always have a love for horses, and even at only five feet six, he stood tall in the saddle-and served in the German army for the seven-week Austro-Prussian War that quickly sparked, flared, and burned out in the summer of 1866.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>����</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"My grandfather was a German cavalry officer who decided he didn't want to be one," Ted said-and in 1869, twenty-five-year-old T. A. Geisel stepped onto the steamship Ohio at the port in Bremen, bound for the United States, where members of his extended family had secured him a job in the store of Springfield jeweler J. B. Rumrill. If Geisel missed his homeland, he seemed only ever looking forward, never back. In 1871, he married Christine Schmaelzle, another recent German immigrant four years his junior. Two children would follow shortly. In 1875, he became an American citizen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>T.A. built a reputation as a talented jeweler-in his five years in Springfield, he had become Springfield's go-to designer for brooches-but in 1876 he abandoned brooches for booze, giving up the jeweling trade entirely to begin a new career as a brewer ("a slight jump," his grandson said archly). Pooling his savings with those of a young brewer's apprentice named Christian Kalmbach, T.A. purchased a small brick brewing plant located way out on Boston Road on the east side of town, right at the last stop on the horsecar line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While the facility they purchased was primitive and deemed "feeble" by locals-just a few wooden buildings that produced barely a thousand barrels of beer annually-the proprietors of the new Kalmbach &amp; Geisel Brewery proved remarkably ambitious and adept both as businessmen and brewers. Under the guidance of T. A. Geisel, who had a knack for property and structures, the wooden brewery quickly expanded into one of the largest in the region, becoming a "magnificent" compound of redbrick buildings surrounding a central courtyard and eventually taking up twelve grassy acres.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For a while, the Geisels lived on the grounds of the brewing compound, then took a small cottage directly across from the brewery on State Street. It was here, in the shadow of the smokestack of the Kalmbach &amp; Geisel Brewery, that T.A. and Christine Geisel had their fourth child and first son, Theodor Robert Geisel-Dr. Seuss's father-on June 28, 1879. In the coming decade, there would be two more surviving children, Adolph and Christine-but as the first son and namesake, it was T.R. who was expected to follow in his father's footsteps in the brewing industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before T.R. was three, the brewery that once produced less than a thousand barrels of beer in a year was delivering at least that much in a single day, fanning a small army of beer wagons out across Springfield every morning, each distinctive black and gold wagon drawn by majestic four-horse teams. As a boy, T.R. would rise early to head off to school; his father, meanwhile, had already been up for hours, overseeing the several hundred barrels of Kalmbach &amp; Geisel beer that were loaded onto trains to ship daily through all of New England. "It was good beer, too," said Ted-so good, in fact, that Kalmbach &amp; Geisel would be fondly referred to by locals as "Come back and guzzle."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And guzzle the locals did-so much so that the brewery would continue to grow and thrive over the next decade, prompting T.A. to add an enormous icehouse and replace their compound of buildings with a brand-new state-of-the-art three-story brick structure. In 1893, with profits soaring and more than 400,000 barrels of beer rolling out annually, T.A. bought out Christian Kalmbach, renamed the business the Highland Brewing Company, and immediately designated himself as the new organization's president, treasurer, and manager.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Five years later, the still-growing Highland Brewing Company was sold and incorporated-along with several local rivals, including the Hampden Brewing Company, just up the river in Willimansett-to form the Springfield Breweries Company. T.A. pocketed his profits but insisted on remaining as manager of the Highland facility, and jockeyed to have his nineteen-year-old son T.R. hired as treasurer for the entire organization. Despite the lofty title and elevated responsibilities, T.R. Geisel would modestly list his occupation simply as "bookkeeper."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>T.A., however, would always proudly identify himself as a brewer, a title anyone of German extraction would bear with particular satisfaction. As the proprietor of one of New England's most successful breweries-and an active member of some of the leading German clubs of Springfield-T.A. was understandably a proud man. Devoted to family-he would insist his children live under his own roof until they married-T.A. had only one real hobby: his beautiful team of horses, which he kept decked out in the finest gear. With his broad shoulders, a wide mustache that curled slightly at the ends, and piercing blue eyes that seemed set in a perpetual squint, T.A. was imperial in bearing, though not imposing-he was a bit too short for that. His grandson, however, would always remember him in a slightly mythic manner, recalling his Gro�vater as wearing "boiled white shirts and diamond studs and [who] sat in deep leather chairs with Persian rugs at his feet."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By 1901, T.A. was ready to become his own boss again, and enlisted twenty-two-year-old T.R. as his partner for his newest start-up endeavor, the Liberty Brewing Company, with riverside offices at the busy corner at Liberty and Charles Streets. This time, T.R. was appointed as both treasurer and secretary of the company, titles he was proud to boast of and which he hoped would impress the young woman he'd been wooing for a year, a twenty-three-year-old baker's daughter named Henrietta Seuss.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like T.R., Henrietta-called "Nettie"-was a first-generation Springfielder. Born May 13, 1878, she was the daughter of George and Margaretha Seuss, who had emigrated from Bavaria and established a successful bakery in their new hometown. Like the Geisels, the Seusses were active in Springfield's German community. George Seuss, in fact, had been a founder of the popular Springfield Turnverein, a social club and gymnasium with a heavily German clientele, and also served as a city alderman. Seuss's popular bakery, located in the heart of downtown Springfield, was hard to miss-one only had to follow one's nose to find it on Howard Street, practically in the shadow of the massive Springfield Armory. If brewing was a family business for the Geisels, the bakery was similarly a Seussian family affair; Nettie, in fact, had worked at the bakery since the age of fifteen, her loyalty to the family firm overriding her desire to attend college.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>T.R. and Nettie made an attractive, if somewhat intimidating, couple. Both were six feet tall and athletic in build. Nettie, a dark-haired beauty, weighed nearly two hundred pounds, was an expert diver, and in a town that took marksmanship seriously-it was the home of Smith &amp; Wesson, after all-was a crack shot with a rifle. Like his father, T.R. was dark-haired and dark-eyed, with a regal bearing. He also was an accomplished horseman, as well as one of the very best sharpshooters in the region; in 1902, he would hold the world record for shooting at two hundred yards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The two seem to have met some resistance to their relationship. On August 31, 1901, the young couple sneaked away to New York and covertly married, a secret they seem to have kept until the news finally trickled into the pages of the Springfield Republican nearly a year later. "The announcement was as much a surprise to their closest friends as to others," the Republican reported. "[N]o one had been given an inkling of what had happened."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The announcement of the marriage also sparked some tut-tutting from those in the burgeoning temperance movement-a crusade that would soon have far-reaching consequences for the Geisels-who disapproved of the matrimonial merging of the Seuss and Geisel businesses. "Seuss the baker puts the staff of life in people's mouths," commented one wag, while "Geisel the brewer takes it out and pours beer there instead, causing the children of drinkers to suffer the pangs of hunger."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Such criticism aside, the secret likely couldn't have been kept much longer anyway; by the time of the marriage's revelation in March, Nettie was visibly pregnant with their first child-and on July 4, 1902, gave birth to a daughter they named Margaretha Christine Geisel. T.R. would dotingly call her Marnie, a nickname that would stick. That same year, T. A. Geisel-now officially a Gro�vater himself-would move from his modest cottage on State Street to a spacious house at 162 Sumner Avenue, the grandest street in Springfield, lined with large Victorian houses and bordering the gigantic Forest Park on the park's short north end. The house had plenty of room for family, but T.R. and Nettie seem to have preferred living with or near her parents in Howard Street instead, perhaps because the Seusses lived within walking distance of T.R.'s offices at the Liberty Brewing Company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was here, in the Seuss house at 22 Howard Street-just down the street from the Seuss family bakery-that T.R. and Nettie Geisel had their second child and first son on March 2, 1904, a cold but fair-weathered Wednesday. Like his father and grandfather before him, the boy was named Theodor, with the middle name Seuss-pronounced Soyce, in proper German fashion-affixed as a recognition of his mother's side of the family.</p></p><h2>The Road to Guilford Courthouse: The American Revolution in the Carolinas</h2><p>A brilliant account of the proud and ferocious American fighters who stood up to the British forces in savage battles crucial in deciding both the fate of the Carolina colonies and the outcome of the war.<br><br>""A tense, exciting historical account of a little known chapter of the Revolution, displaying history writing at its best.""--Kirkus Reviews<br><br>""His compelling narrative brings readers closer than ever before to the reality of Revolutionary warfare in the Carolinas.""--Raleigh News &amp; Observer.<br><br> ""Buchanan makes the subject come alive like few others I have seen."" --Dennis Conrad, Editor, The Nathanael Greene Papers.<br><br>""John Buchanan offers us a lively, accurate account of a critical period in the War of Independence in the South. Based on numerous printed primary and secondary sources, it deserves a large reading audience."" --Don Higginbotham, Professor of History, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p><p>Most of us are familiar with the role that North and South Carolina played in the American Civil War: if nothing else, every grade-schooler knows the significance of the 1861 bombardment of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. But to popular historian John Buchanan, "that tragedy is of far less interest than the American Revolution. The Revolution was the most important event in American history. The Civil War was unfinished business." And the Carolinas, Buchanan convincingly argues, were the most critical theater in that conflict, with their wild Back Country seeing "a little-known but savage civil war far exceeding anything in the North."<p> <i>The Road to Guilford Courthouse</i> is no less than a tour de force of pop military scholarship, an exhaustive battle-by-battle account of the Crown's grinding march to wrest the Carolinas from the resourceful Rebels. Beginning with Colonel William Moultrie's valiant defense atop the palmetto ramparts of Fort Sullivan against an outnumbering force of British men-of-war to the final "long, obstinate, and bloody" exchange at Guilford Courthouse, Buchanan meticulously recounts each skirmish, battle, and shift of strategy in the campaign. Relying on copious primary and secondary sources, he brings the combatants to life, from the worthy but somewhat obscure, such as Nathanael Greene, whom George Washington considered to be his successor should he fall, to soon-to-be legends such as Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>A popular historian presents a riveting portrait of the participants and events of a critical campaign during the American Revolution. Buchanan vividly describes the backgrounds and characters of such key figures as Lord Cornwallis, Nathanael Greene, Horatio Gates and Francis, &#34;The Swamp Fox,&#34; Marion, offering fresh perspectives and evaluations of their performance. He discusses the severe social and political tensions between the &#34;Low Country&#34; and the &#34;Back Country&#34;--conditions that had a profound impact on the nature and duration of the campaign.</p><h2>Jonas&#x2019; Introduction to the U.S. Health Care System, 8th Edition</h2><p><p><b>Praise for the Seventh Edition:</b></p><p><i>There are many books on the U.S. healthcare system, but few have the longevity of this one.

It is richly illustrated with lively anecdotes drawn from parents and teachers who have discovered how the power of story can help resolve a range of common childhood behaviours and situations such as separation anxiety, bullying, sibling rivalry, nightmares and grieving.</p><p>Working with both modern and traditional tales, and many personal stories, the following chapters offer imaginative possibilities for transforming problematic behaviour and situations with young children. They also provide teachers, parents, childcare workers and child therapists with a range of skills to create stories that address challenging behaviour. <p>Included in the text are eighty stories divided into different behaviour categories for easy reference - to work with directly, adapt or use as models for creating your own tales. Brief notes precede each story, with an age guide and suggestions for use. The categories cover many kinds of commonly identified challenging behaviour, from dishonesty through laziness to teasing and bullying; everyday situations like `tidy-up time'; experiences such as `moving house'; or problems and difficulties such as `separation anxiety', `fear and nightmares' and `illness and grieving'. The range of selected stories and ideas are suitable for ages three to eight. </p><p>If you feel inspired to write your own therapeutic tales, the text provides a story-making model - a threefold framework of `Metaphor', `Journey' and `Resolution' - to guide you. </p><p>Beside this framework, the book has chapters on age-appropriate stories, multicultural perspectives, props and presentation aids, and guidelines for the telling of stories. It is my hope, with some help from these sections, that you will feel encouraged to write and tell your own stories, and so perpetuate and develop age-old story traditions.</p><b>Susan Perrow</b> is a story-loving Australian with twenty-two years in early childhood work (teaching three- to eight-year-olds), teacher training, storytelling, storywriting, and course facilitating.

Astrid Lindgren surely gains new stature in a probing world far removed from Pippi Longstocking -- this one is far deeper, and more demanding of courage, than any of Lindgren's previous works. Even on a surface level, the story must be her most unusual and unexpected; but what sticks in the mind are the endlessly fascinating quesions she raises. Lindgren is speculating not only on the human situation but on the very nature of what may or may nor lie very darkly beyond it. It may be unsettling, but that's exactly as it should be. <p>--Lloyd Alexander</p>Born in Sweden in 1907. During the course of her life she wrote over 40 books for children. She once commented: 'I write to amuse the child within me, and can only hope that other children may have some fun that way too.' Many of her stories are based upon her memories of childhood, and<br>filled with lively and unconventional characters. Perhaps the best known is Pippi Longstocking, first published in Sweden in 1945. It was an immediate success with children, and was later published in England in 1954. During her lifetime, Lindgren was awarded dozens of Swedish and international<br>prizes for her writing, among them the prestigious Hans Christian Andersen medal in 1958.

In his defense, some have alleged that the pope was doing a great deal to help the Jews but that his efforts were necessarily behind the scenes. This meticulously researched and balanced book examines exactly what the pope, his advisers, and his assistants at the Vatican Secretariat of State did to help the Jews of Italy. It finds that they did very little.<br><br>The book begins by discussing prewar Vatican and Jesuit publications, in which Zuccotti uncovers a hitherto unsuspected prevalence of anti-Jewish sentiment. These publications, along with archival documents, indicate that Vatican protests against Italian anti-Jewish laws were limited to measures affecting converts and Jews in mixed marriages with Catholics, as was help with emigration; the papal nuncio&#x2019;s visits to foreign Jews in Italian internment camps did not differ from those to non-Jews and in no way eased their material discomfort; and interventions by diplomats of the Holy See for Jews threatened with deportation were rare, always polite, and seldom decisive.<br><br>Above all, Zuccotti finds no evidence of a papal directive to church institutions to shelter Jews and much evidence to suggest that the pope remained uninvolved. The notion that Pius XII was benevolent and helpful to Jews behind the scenes proves to be a myth.</p><p><i>Under His Very Windows: The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy</i> describes what the Vatican did--or did not do--to help Jews in Italy in World War II. Author Susan Zuccotti, who has written two other books about the Holocaust, demonstrates that little help of any kind came from Popes Pius XI and XII or their senior officials. She finds that the most significant gestures of help offered by the Church to Jews in Italy were made by clerics and believers--mostly nuns, monks, and priests--uninvolved in top-level Vatican discussions. By 1942, the pope "knew and believed a great deal about the exterminations." In 1943, when Germans took control of northern and central Italy and attempted to exterminate the region's Jewish population, the Vatican knew very clearly the magnitude of the genocide. The Vatican's silence, Zuccotti argues, still resonates in the Church's statements about the Holocaust today. <blockquote>The Church has not yet completed the process of dealing honestly with its history during the Holocaust. It has not yet made clear whether popes and high Vatican officials are to be included among its sons and daughters in every age who sometimes committed regrettable errors.</blockquote> Zuccotti's research ranges wide, from the anti-Jewish tone of Jesuit publications in the years leading up to World War II to contemporary interviews with Holocaust survivors. Her book is a significant addition to a chapter of Christian history that the Church has still to reckon with. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Winner of the 2000 National Jewish Book Award in the Jewish-Christian Relations category <br>Winner of The 2002 Sybil Halpern Milton Memorial Prize awarded by the German Studies Association</p><h2>Snopes: A Trilogy (Snopes Trilogy)</h2><p><p><b>From the Modern Library&#x2019;s new set of beautifully repackaged hardcover classics by William Faulkner&#x2014;also available are <i>As I Lay Dying, The Sound and the Fury, Light in August, Absalom, Absalom!, </i>and <i>Selected Short Stories</i></b><br><br>Here, published in a single volume as he always hoped they would be, are the three novels that comprise William Faulkner&#x2019;s famous Snopes trilogy, a saga that stands as perhaps the greatest feat of this celebrated author&#x2019;s incomparable imagination. <i>The Hamlet, </i>the first book of the series chronicling the advent and rise of the grasping Snopes family in mythical Yoknapatawpha County, is a work that Cleanth Brooks called &#x201c;one of the richest novels in the Faulkner canon.&#x201d; It recounts how the wily, cunning Flem Snopes dominates the rural community of Frenchman&#x2019;s Bend&#x2014;and claims the voluptuous Eula Varner as his bride. <i>The Town,</i> the central novel, records Flem&#x2019;s ruthless struggle to take over the county seat of Jefferson, Mississippi.

Hill-cradled and remote, definite yet without boundaries, straddling into two counties and owning allegiance to neither, it had been the original grant and site of a tremendous pre-Civil War plantation, the ruins of which&#x2014;the gutted shell of an enormous house with its fallen stables and slave quarters and overgrown gardens and brick terraces and promenades&#x2014;were still known as the Old Frenchman&#x2019;s place, although the original boundaries now existed only on old faded records in the Chancery Clerk&#x2019;s office in the county courthouse in Jefferson, and even some of the once-fertile fields had long since reverted to the cane-and-cypress jungle from which their first master had hewed them.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had quite possibly been a foreigner, though not necessarily French, since to the people who had come after him and had almost obliterated all trace of his sojourn, anyone speaking the tongue with a foreign flavor or whose appearance or even occupation was strange, would have been a Frenchman regardless of what nationality he might affirm, just as to their more urban coevals (if he had elected to settle in Jefferson itself, say) he would have been called a Dutchman. But now nobody knew what he had actually been, not even Will Varner, who was sixty years old and now owned a good deal of his original grant, including the site of his ruined mansion. Because he was gone now, the foreigner, the Frenchman, with his family and his slaves and his magnificence. His dream, his broad acres were parcelled out now into small shiftless mortgaged farms for the directors of Jefferson banks to squabble over before selling finally to Will Varner, and all that remained of him was the river bed which his slaves had straightened for almost ten miles to keep his land from flooding and the skeleton of the tremendous house which his heirs-at-large had been pulling down and chopping up&#x2014;walnut newel posts and stair spindles, oak floors which fifty years later would have been almost priceless, the very clapboards themselves&#x2014;for thirty years now for firewood. Even his name was forgotten, his pride but a legend about the land he had wrested from the jungle and tamed as a monument to that appellation which those who came after him in battered wagons and on muleback and even on foot, with flintlock rifles and dogs and children and home-made whiskey stills and Protestant psalm-books, could not even read, let alone pronounce, and which now had nothing to do with any once-living man at all&#x2014;his dream and his pride now dust with the lost dust of his anonymous bones, his legend but the stubborn tale of the money he buried somewhere about the place when Grant overran the country on his way to Vicksburg.<br> &nbsp;<br> The people who inherited from him came from the northeast, through the Tennessee mountains by stages marked by the bearing and raising of a generation of children. They came from the Atlantic seaboard and before that, from England and the Scottish and Welsh Marches, as some of the names would indicate&#x2014;Turpin and Haley and Whittington, McCallum and Murray and Leonard and Little-john, and other names like Riddup and Armstid and Doshey which could have come from nowhere since certainly no man would deliberately select one of them for his own. They brought no slaves and no Phyfe and Chippendale highboys; indeed, what they did bring most of them could (and did) carry in their hands. They took up land and built one- and two-room cabins and never painted them, and married one another and produced children and added other rooms one by one to the original cabins and did not paint them either, but that was all. Their descendants still planted cotton in the bottom land and corn along the edge of the hills and in the secret coves in the hills made whiskey of the corn and sold what they did not drink. Federal officers went into the country and vanished. Some garment which the missing man had worn might be seen&#x2014;a felt hat, a broadcloth coat, a pair of city shoes or even his pistol&#x2014;on a child or an old man or woman. County officers did not bother them at all save in the heel of election years. They supported their own churches and schools, they married and committed infrequent adulteries and more frequent homicides among themselves and were their own courts judges and executioners. They were Protestants and Democrats and prolific; there was not one Negro landowner in the entire section. Strange Negroes would absolutely refuse to pass through it after dark.<br> &nbsp;<br> Will Varner, the present owner of the Old Frenchman place, was the chief man of the country. He was the largest landholder and beat supervisor in one county and Justice of the Peace in the next and election commissioner in both, and hence the fountainhead if not of law at least of advice and suggestion to a countryside which would have repudiated the term constituency if they had ever heard it, which came to him, not in the attitude of What must I do but What do you think you think you would like for me to do if you was able to make me do it. He was a farmer, a usurer, a veterinarian; Judge Benbow of Jefferson once said of him that a milder-mannered man never bled a mule or stuffed a ballot box. He owned most of the good land in the country and held mortgages on most of the rest. He owned the store and the cotton gin and the combined grist mill and blacksmith shop in the village proper and it was considered, to put it mildly, bad luck for a man of the neighborhood to do his trading or gin his cotton or grind his meal or shoe his stock anywhere else. He was thin as a fence rail and almost as long, with reddish-gray hair and moustaches and little hard bright innocently blue eyes; he looked like a Methodist Sunday School superintendent who on week days conducted a railroad passenger train or vice versa and who owned the church or perhaps the railroad or perhaps both. He was shrewd secret and merry, of a Rabelaisian turn of mind and very probably still sexually lusty (he had fathered sixteen children to his wife, though only two of them remained at home, the others scattered, married and buried, from El Paso to the Alabama line) as the spring of his hair which even at sixty was still more red than gray, would indicate. He was at once active and lazy; he did nothing at all (his son managed all the family business) and spent all his time at it, out of the house and gone before the son had come down to breakfast even, nobody knew where save that he and the old fat white horse which he rode might be seen anywhere within the surrounding ten miles at any time, and at least once every month during the spring and summer and early fall, the old white horse tethered to an adjacent fence post, he would be seen by someone sitting in a home-made chair on the jungle-choked lawn of the Old Frenchman&#x2019;s homesite. His blacksmith had made the chair for him by sawing an empty flour barrel half through the middle and trimming out the sides and nailing a seat into it and Varner would sit there chewing his tobacco or smoking his cob pipe, with a brusque word for passers cheerful enough but inviting no company, against his background of fallen baronial splendor. The people (those who saw him sitting there and those who were told about it) all believed that he sat there planning his next mortgage foreclosure in private, since it was only to an itinerant sewing-machine agent named Ratliff&#x2014;a man less than half his age&#x2014;that he ever gave a reason: &#x201c;I like to sit here. I&#x2019;m trying to find out what it must have felt like to be the fool that would need all this&#x201d;&#x2014;he did not move, he did not so much as indicate with his head the rise of old brick and tangled walks topped by the columned ruin behind him&#x2014;&#x201c;just to eat and sleep in.&#x201d; Then he said&#x2014;and he gave Ratliff no further clue to which might have been the truth&#x2014;&#x201c;For a while it looked like I was going to get shut of it, get it cleared up. But by God folks have got so lazy they wont even climb a ladder to pull off the rest of the boards It looks like they will go into the woods and even chop up a tree before they will reach above eyelevel for a scantling of pine kindling. But after all, I reckon I&#x2019;ll just keep what there is left of it, just to remind me of my one mistake. This is the only thing I ever bought in my life I couldn&#x2019;t sell to nobody.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Encyclopedia of Electronic Components Volume 2: LEDs, LCDs, Audio, Thyristors, Digital Logic, and Amplification</h2><p><p>Want to know how to use an electronic component?

Billington, 13th Librarian of Congress</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Layering joy and urgent defiance&#x2014;against physical and cultural erasure, against white supremacy whether intangible or graven in stone&#x2014;Trethewey&#x2019;s work gives pedestal and witness to unsung icons. <i>Monument</i>, Trethewey&#x2019;s first retrospective, draws together verse that delineates the stories of working class African American women, a mixed-race prostitute, one of the first black Civil War regiments, mestizo and mulatto figures in Casta paintings, Gulf coast victims of Katrina. Through the collection, inlaid and inextricable, winds the poet&#x2019;s own family history of trauma and loss, resilience and love.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this setting, each section, each poem drawn from an &#x201c;opus of classics both elegant and necessary,&#x201d;* weaves and interlocks with those that come before and those that follow. As a whole, <i>Monument</i> casts new light on the trauma of our national wounds, our shared history. This is a poet&#x2019;s remarkable labor to source evidence, persistence, and strength from the past in order to change the very foundation of the vocabulary we use to speak about race, gender, and our collective future.<br> &nbsp;<br> *Academy of American Poets&#x2019; chancellor Marilyn Nelson<br><br> &nbsp;</p><p>NATASHA TRETHEWEY, two-term U.S. Poet Laureate, Pulitzer Prize winner, and 2017 Heinz Award recipient, has written five collections of poetry and one book of nonfiction. An American Academy of Arts and Sciences fellow, she is currently Board of Trustees professor of English at Northwestern University. She lives in Evanston, Illinois.&#x201c;The Mississippi-born poet Natasha Trethewey has an exalted r�sum� . . . but her poems are earthy; they fly close to the ground . . . Trethewey pivots knowingly, in her poetry, between hard times and good ones. The delicate branches of her verse run you along a harrowing borderline of substance and illusion . . . [Trethewey has an] insistent intellect and [a] gift for turning over rich soil . . . The human details in Trethewey&#x2019;s work&#x2014;those crabs, that music, those cracked palms&#x2014;are like the small feathers that give contour to a bird&#x2019;s wing. <i>Monument</i> is a major book, and in her best poems this poet soars.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Dwight Garner, </b><i><b>New York Times</b></i><br><br> &#x201c;This collection of old and new poems by the former poet laureate of the United States includes Trethewey&#x2019;s powerful reflections on the way our nation contends with its diversity and memorializes its past. Think you&#x2019;re not a poetry person? Think again. Trethewey&#x2019;s verse is as accessible as it is brilliant.&#x201d;<i><b>&#x2014;Washington Post</b></i><br><br> &#x201c;We have seen, over a very few years, the ways language and words can so bitterly divide us. The very fact that a poet laureate can exist at all seems an act of hope&#x2014;is there one writer who could possibly represent this whole country? Natasha Trethewey was a two-term laureate, and her poetry seems to fit that description, precise in word choice but wide in subject and historical memory. Her new collection is called <i>Monument</i>, and that's what it feels like in some ways&#x2014;patriotic, brave, honest&#x2014;with a power that feels like some stanzas could slash you to ribbons.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>NPR</b><br><br><b>&#x201c;T</b>he arrival of&nbsp;<i>Monument</i>&nbsp;is perfectly timed, or specific to this moment . . . what stands out beyond that is how many ways Trethewey finds to revisit and restructure history: her own, but also the histories of black people in America.&nbsp;The book&#x2019;s title is a tribute to many things, both the immovability of America&#x2019;s obsession with monuments and the task of building and rebuilding one&#x2019;s self in an attempt to obscure grief.&nbsp;Her use of history as a driving force behind her poetry and as a nudge toward enlightenment&#x2014;for herself and others&#x2014;feels rooted in a type of empathy. Throughout this vast catalog of work, teeming with references to specific dates or old photos, Trethewey doesn&#x2019;t shame readers for what they don&#x2019;t know. Instead, she invites them to learn alongside her . . . this is a black woman who has committed an entire life and career to holding a country accountable, despite the weight of her own grief.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Hanif Abdurraqib,&nbsp;</b><i><b>BuzzFeed</b></i><br><br> &#x201c;For poets, she&#x2019;ll be remembered for her deft use of subtlety, for her use of forms that make ironic the subjects they hold, for her very interesting way of interweaving personal history and public history&#x2014;their impact on each other&#x2014;in a single book. And for critics and other readers, I think she&#x2019;ll be remembered for the ways that the poems are all-out acts of resistance and anger. There always seems to me something seething between the lines of every Natasha Trethewey poem, which is part of what makes her work so admirable and so completely impossible to imitate.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Jericho Brown</b><br><br> &#x201c;Trethewey&#x2019;s book&#x2014;her first retrospective collection&#x2014;is a literary edifice that painstakingly, heartbreakingly, and victoriously memorializes those deemed unworthy of citation in academic syllabi or among the nation&#x2019;s public statuary. It&#x2019;s a marker in America&#x2019;s conversation on race and gender. More intimately, it&#x2019;s a Mississippi-soaked, multi-voiced remembrance of Trethewey&#x2019;s departed parents. While the collection spans work over an eighteen-year period, it stays in earnest conversation with today&#x2019;s fervent headlines . . . <i>Monument</i> is the literary activism of the archivist, the social justice work of the painstaking historian-turned-poet. After reading this volume, it&#x2019;s clear why her work is monumental&#x2014;this book is a must-read for people interested in where America has been, where it&#x2019;s headed, and how to traverse the crossroads of the country&#x2019;s literature while also perhaps saving their soul at the beginning of this turbulent century.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Tyehimba Jess, </b><i><b>Poetry Foundation</b></i><br><br> &#x201c;Her exquisite and brutal lyricism as well as her commitment to truth makes Trethewey one of the most important American poets of our time . . . Her new book, <i>Monument</i>, is . . . a vibrant and timely book, deeply aware of our nation&#x2019;s chaotic moment and its historical resonances . . . Trethewey is a tremendously empathic and enthusiastic force in our nation&#x2019;s bleak period. Her words settle with profound gravity.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Paris Review</b></i><br><br> &#x201c;Natasha Trethewey&#x2019;s first selected volume of poems&nbsp;is the opposite of what her title suggests. This is no freeze framing of the past into bronze. Here instead in eighty-three remarkable poems lives history and memory as a wound one cannot heal, only tend with love. Trethewey powerfully conjures her late mother, breathes life into people erased in plain sight. Photographic subjects glossed but not captured. Domestic life watched but not seen. Southern history in all its hypocrisy. Raised in Mississippi the child of a black mother and a white father when that was illegal, history&#x2019;s arm fell hard on Trethewey, as she writes. Through two decades of work we can now see the poet regarding her own self, interrogating the bargains her skin made for her as a biracial woman. Wondering at what inheritance meant, why absence&#x2014;cruelly delivered in her mother&#x2019;s murder&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t qualify as the maker, these poems, not just she, the made.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b><i><b>Lit Hub</b></i><br><br> &#x201c;For readers unfamiliar with the poet Natasha Trethewey&#x2014;or with contemporary poetry more generally; or, for that matter, with the raveled history of the South&#x2014;<i>Monument: Poems New and Selected</i> is an exquisite starting place . . . Trethewey has from the beginning focused on a fixed palette of themes&#x2014; memory, history, race&#x2014;and <i>Monument </i>offers a cohesive exploration of those thematic concerns, revealing a poet mining ever deeper into the hot core of her ideas . . . Trethewey is . . . about as canonical as living poets get.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Garden &amp; Gun</b></i><br><br> &#x201c;Trethewey is a poet to return to&#x2014;we know she&#x2019;s special, and then comes along the aptly titled <i>Monument</i>, and the evidence feels almost overwhelming. Her work is God-haunted, clothed with the small flashes of memory against despair . . . One of the best collected volumes published this year.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>The Millions</b></i><br><br> &#x201c;Natasha Trethewey&#x2019;s <i>Monument </i>offers just that: a living memorial to a mother lost too soon, a reworking of her classic books to bring out the themes of history and memory all the more profoundly, and a rock-solid testament to a tremendous career still underway. The new poems also offer a sense of her trajectory as a public poet who has made her private concerns ever-present and everlasting, with an exactness of language that remains unmatched.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Kevin Young, </b><i><b>Nylon</b></i><br><br><i>&#x201c;</i><i>Monument, </i>which is released the day after this week&#x2019;s midterm elections, is a call to action for us to record and remember our histories&#x2014;even, and especially, the parts that make us uncomfortable and uneasy&#x2014;and find strength in them as the resistance marches on . . . The book is incredible, and so powerful.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Ms. </b></i><i><b>magazine</b></i><br><br> &#x201c;The scope of <i>Monument</i> is impressive . . . Trethewey consistently delivers . . . [She] digs deep. And the meaning she unearths from her &#x2018;cluttered house of memory&#x2019; is tragic, beautiful and consciousness-raising. Reading it reminds us it takes guts to confront painful parts of our past. It reminds us how alike we all are. And it reminds us we are not alone.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</b></i><br><br><i>&#x201c;</i><i>Monument </i>offers a hefty cross-section of the poet&#x2019;s wide-ranging and important work. . . . A momentous collection that uses verse to enshrine both the historical and deeply personal. It places Trethewey in the pantheon of American poetry.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Shelf Awareness</b></i><br><br> &#x201c;I think of Trethewey&#x2019;s poetic career as a mode of intense, unwavering, lyrical watching. She watches the past so we don&#x2019;t forget it. She watches the future so we might know it. She watches language so we might learn it. She watches herself watch her memory of her mother. She watches America. She watches poetry. Like her brother, her watching is a kind of faith,&nbsp;faith in poetry a monument.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Dean Rader, </b><i><b>On the Seawall</b></i><br><br> &#x201c;Trethewey&#x2019;s genius for dovetailing the personal and the communal, the impressionistic and the factual, was evident from the start . . . For all the tragic, overlooked history Trethewey reclaims with clarion lyricism, it is her own family complexities and terrible loss that reverberate most. <i>Monument </i>is an essential volume of piercing wit, elegiac beauty, profound insights intimate and cultural, and the sustaining power of remembrance.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Booklist</b></i><b>, starred review</b><br><br> &#x201c;Two-term US Poet Laureate Trethewey (<i>Thrall</i>) culls some of the finest work from her illustrious two-decade career and presents formally diverse new poems exploring her customary themes . . . Trethewey&#x2019;s arresting images, urgent tone, and surgically precise language meld with exacting use of rhyme and anaphora create an intensity that propels the poems forward. This collection is ideal for new readers seeking a representative sample of Trethewey&#x2019;s best work.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i><b>, starred review</b></p><h2>Once &amp; Future King</h2><p>Once and Future King</p><p>T.H. White died in 1964, leaving a literary legacy that places him alongside J R.R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis and Mervyn Peake as one of the 20th Century&#39;s greatest British fantasists. He has inspired generations of fantasy writers, from Neil Gaiman to JK Rowling. Born in India in 1906, White studied at Queens&#39; College, Cambridge, where he wrote a thesis on Thomas Malory&#39;s Le Morte d&#39;Arthur. He found success with his `preface to Malory&#39;, The Sword in the Stone, a wonderfully imaginative retelling of King Arthur&#39;s early life. He continued to explore the Arthurian mythos in four further volumes - The Witch in the Wood, The Ill-Made Knight, The Candle in the Wind and The Book of Merlyn - a sequence collectively known as The Once and Future King. The novels were famously adapted into the Disney film The Sword in the Stone in 1963.<p>ONE</p><p>On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays it was Court Hand and Summulae Logicales, while the rest of the week it was the Organon, Repetition and Astrology. The governess was always getting muddled with her astrolabe, and when she got specially muddled she would take it out of the Wart by rapping his knuckles. She did not rap Kay&#x2019;s knuckles, because when Kay grew older he would be Sir Kay, the master of the estate. The Wart was called the Wart because it more or less rhymed with Art, which was short for his real name. Kay had given him the nickname. Kay was not called anything but Kay, as he was too dignified to have a nickname and would have flown into a passion if anybody had tried to give him one. The governess had red hair and some mysterious wound from which she derived a lot of prestige by showing it to all the women of the castle, behind closed doors. It was believed to be where she sat down, and to have been caused by sitting on some armour at a picnic by mistake. Eventually she offered to show it to Sir Ector, who was Kay&#x2019;s father, had hysterics and was sent away. They found out afterwards that she had been in a lunatic hospital for three years.</p><p>In the afternoons the programme was: Mondays and Fridays, tilting and horsemanship; Tuesdays, hawking; Wednesdays, fencing; Thursdays, archery; Saturdays, the theory of chivalry, with the proper measures to be blown on all occasions, terminology of the chase and hunting etiquette. If you did the wrong thing at the mort or the undoing, for instance, you were bent over the body of the dead beast and smacked with the flat side of a sword. This was called being bladed. It was horseplay, a sort of joke like being shaved when crossing the line. Kay was not bladed, although he often went wrong.</p><p>When they had got rid of the governess, Sir Ector said, &#x201c;After all, damn it all, we can&#x2019;t have the boys runnin&#x2019; about all day like hooligans&#x2014;after all, damn it all?

He attributed to this weakness the fact that he could never get beyond the Future Simple of Utor. It was a third of the way down the left-hand leaf, he said. He thought it was leaf ninety-seven.

Also they were drinking Metheglyn, not port, but by mentioning the modern wine it is easier to give you the feel.</p><p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t so much the distance,&#x201d; said Sir Ector, &#x201c;but that giant What&#x2019;s-&#x2019;is-name is in the way.

Fellow that lives by the Burbly Water.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Galapas,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the very chap.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The only other thing,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, &#x201c;is to have a tutor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean a fellow who teaches you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore. &#x201c;A tutor, you know, a fellow who teaches you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have some more port,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;You need it after all this questin&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Splendid day,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore. &#x201c;Only they never seem to kill nowadays. Run twenty-five miles and then mark to ground or lose him altogether. The worst is when you start a fresh quest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We kill all our giants cubbin&#x2019;,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;After that they give you a fine run, but get away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Run out of scent,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, &#x201c;I dare say. It&#x2019;s always the same with these big giants in a big country. They run out of scent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But even if you was to have a tutor,&#x201d; said Sir Ector, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how you would get him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Advertise,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore.</p><p>&#x201c;I have advertised,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;It was cried by the <i>Humberland Newsman and Cardoile Advertiser</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The only other way,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore, &#x201c;is to start a quest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean a quest for a tutor,&#x201d; explained Sir Ector.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hic, Haec, Hoc,&#x201d; said Sir Ector. &#x201c;Have some more of this drink, whatever it calls itself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hunc,&#x201d; said Sir Grummore.</p><p>So it was decided. When Grummore Grummursum had gone home next day, Sir Ector tied a knot in his handkerchief to remember to start a quest for a tutor as soon as he had time to do so, and, as he was not sure how to set about it, he told the boys what Sir Grummore had suggested and warned them not to be hooligans meanwhile. Then they went hay-making.</p><p>It was July, and every able-bodied man and woman on the estate worked during that month in the field, under Sir Ector&#x2019;s direction. In any case the boys would have been excused from being eddicated just then.</p><p>Sir Ector&#x2019;s castle stood in an enormous clearing in a still more enormous forest. It had a courtyard and a moat with pike in it. The moat was crossed by a fortified stone bridge which ended half-way across it. The other half was covered by a wooden drawbridge which was wound up every night. As soon as you had crossed the drawbridge you were at the top of the village street&#x2014;it had only one street&#x2014;and this extended for about half a mile, with thatched houses of wattle and daub on either side of it. The street divided the clearing into two huge fields, that on the left being cultivated in hundreds of long narrow strips, while that on the right ran down to a river and was used as pasture. Half of the right-hand field was fenced off for hay.</p><p>It was July, and real July weather, such as they had in Old England. Everybody went bright brown, like Red Indians, with startling teeth and flashing eyes. The dogs moved about with their tongues hanging out, or lay panting in bits of shade, while the farm horses sweated through their coats and flicked their tails and tried to kick the horse-flies off their bellies with their great hind hoofs. In the pasture field the cows were on the gad, and could be seen galloping about with their tails in the air, which made Sir Ector angry.</p><p>Sir Ector stood on the top of a rick, whence he could see what everybody was doing, and shouted commands all over the two-hundred-acre field, and grew purple in the face. The best mowers mowed away in a line where the grass was still uncut, their scythes roaring in the strong sunlight. The women raked the dry hay together in long strips with wooden rakes, and the two boys with pitchforks followed up on either side of the strip, turning the hay inwards so that it lay well for picking up. Then the great carts followed, rumbling with their spiked wooden wheels, drawn by horses or slow white oxen. One man stood on top of the cart to receive the hay and direct operations, while one man walked on either side picking up what the boys had prepared and throwing it to him with a fork. The cart was led down the lane between two lines of hay, and was loaded in strict rotation from the front poles to the back, the man on top calling out in a stern voice where he wanted each fork to be pitched. The loaders grumbled at the boys for not having laid the hay properly and threatened to tan them when they caught them, if they got left behind.</p><p>When the wagon was loaded, it was drawn to Sir Ector&#x2019;s rick and pitched to him. It came up easily because it had been loaded systematically&#x2014;not like modern hay&#x2014;and Sir Ector scrambled about on top, getting in the way of his assistants, who did the real work, and stamping and perspiring and scratching about with his fork and trying to make the rick grow straight and shouting that it would all fall down as soon as the west winds came.</p><p>The Wart loved hay-making, and was good at it. Kay, who was two years older, generally stood on the edge of the bundle which he was trying to pick up, with the result that he worked twice as hard as the Wart for only half the result. But he hated to be beaten at anything, and used to fight away with the wretched hay&#x2014;which he loathed like poison&#x2014;until he was quite sick.</p><p>The day after Sir Grummore&#x2019;s visit was sweltering for the men who toiled from milking to milking and then again till sunset in their battle with the sultry element. For the hay was an element to them, like sea or air, in which they bathed and plunged themselves and which they even breathed in. The seeds and small scraps stuck in their hair, their mouths, their nostrils, and worked, tickling, inside their clothes. They did not wear many clothes, and the shadows between their sliding muscles were blue on the nut-brown skins. Those who feared thunder had felt ill that morning.</p><p>In the afternoon the storm broke. Sir Ector kept them at it till the great flashes were right overhead, and then, with the sky as dark as night, the rain came hurling against them so that they were drenched at once and could not see a hundred yards. The boys lay crouched under the wagons, wrapped in hay to keep their wet bodies warm against the now cold wind, and all joked with one another while heaven fell. Kay was shivering, though not with cold, but he joked like the others because he would not show he was afraid. At the last and greatest thunderbolt every man startled involuntarily, and each saw the other startle, until they laughed away their shame.</p><p>But that was the end of the hay-making and the beginning of play. The boys were sent home to change their clothes. The old dame who had been their nurse fetched dry jerkins out of a press, and scolded them for catching their deaths, and denounced Sir Ector for keeping on so long. Then they slipped their heads into the laundered shirts, and ran out to the refreshed and sparkling court.</p><p>&#x201c;I vote we take Cully and see if we can get some rabbits in the chase,&#x201d; cried the Wart.</p><p>&#x201c;The rabbits will not be out in this wet,&#x201d; said Kay sarcastically, delighted to have caught him over natural history.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, come on. It will soon be dry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I must carry Cully, then.&#x201d;</p><p>Kay insisted on carrying the goshawk and flying her, when they went hawking together. This he had a right to do, not only because he was older than the Wart but also because he was Sir Ector&#x2019;s proper son. The Wart was not a proper son. He did not understand this, but it made him feel unhappy, because Kay seemed to regard it as making him inferior in some way. Also it was different not having a father and mother, and Kay had taught him that being different was wrong. Nobody talked to him about it, but he thought about it when he was alone, and was distressed. He did not like people to bring it up. Since the other boy always did bring it up when a question of precedence arose, he had got into the habit of giving in at once before it could be mentioned. Besides, he admired Kay and was a born follower. He was a hero-worshipper.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, then,&#x201d; cried the Wart, and they scampered off toward the Mews, turning a few cartwheels on the way.</p></p><h2>The Republic and The Laws (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Cicero's <em>The Republic</em> is an impassioned plea for responsible government written just before the civil war that ended the Roman Republic in a dialogue following Plato.

But man (and woman) cannot survive on ice cream and beer alone, and so the denizens of Jiangsu have come up with some pretty great summer foods. This simple yet delicious duck dish is one such example.&nbsp;<br><br>In this recipe, the duck is salted overnight, cooked in nothing more than water, salt, and aromatics, and then chilled. It&#x2019;s that easy. As far as what cut of duck to get, I&#x2019;d recommend duck legs. They are a heck of a lot cheaper than buying an entire bird, they slice up easily once cold, and they are almost all meat. You will need a heavy cleaver to whack up the legs, however, so if you don&#x2019;t have one, get duck breasts instead. They are just as tasty, and they can easily be boned and sliced once cooked.&nbsp;<br><br>D<b>uck </b>a<b>nd s</b>a<b>lt ru</b>b<br> 4 whole duck legs (thighs attached) with skin on&nbsp;<br> 2 tablespoons coarse sea salt&nbsp;<br> 2 teaspoons five-spice powder (page 441 or store-bought)&nbsp;<br> 2 teaspoons ground toasted Sichuan peppercorns (page 441)&nbsp;<br> <b><br>Braising liquid&nbsp;</b><br> 2 green onions, trimmed&nbsp;<br> 1 star anise&nbsp;<br> 5 slices fresh ginger&nbsp;<br> 2 teaspoons sea salt&nbsp;<br><br><b>1. </b>Start this 2 days before you wish to serve it.

Cover the container and chill for about 24 hours.&nbsp;<br> <b><br>2. </b>The next day, rinse the duck legs in plenty of cool tap water, being sure to get rid of all the salt and spices. Place the legs in a small saucepan and add the rest of the ingredients, as well as water to barely cover. Bring the water to a full boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Poach the legs for 30 minutes and then remove the pan from the heat. Let the legs cool in the liquid. Remove the cooled legs to a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate overnight. Just before serving, use a very sharp heavy cleaver to whack the legs into .-inch-wide slices.

Is it the only culprit? No. Most chronic health disorders have multiple causes and require careful disentanglement and complex treatments. But what if toxicants in our foods are a <em>major</em> culprit, one that, if corrected, could lead to tangible results and increased health? Using patient accounts of their clinical experiences and new medical insights about pathogenesis of chronic pediatric disorders&#x2015;taking us into gut dysfunction and the microbiome, as well as the politics of food science&#x2015;this book connects the dots to explain our kids&#x2019; ailing health.</p> <p><em>What&#x2019;s Making Our Children Sick?&nbsp;</em>explores the frightening links between our efforts to create higher-yield, cost-efficient foods and an explosion of childhood morbidity, but it also offers hope and a path to effecting change. The predicament we now face is simple. Agroindustrial &#x201c;innovation&#x201d; in a previous era hoped to prevent the ecosystem disaster of DDT predicted in Rachel Carson&#x2019;s seminal book in 1962, <em>Silent Spring</em>. However, this industrial agriculture movement has created a worse disaster: a toxic environment and, consequently, a toxic food supply. Pesticide use is at an all-time high, despite the fact that biotechnologies aimed to reduce the need for them in the first place. Today these chemicals find their way into our livestock and food crop industries and ultimately onto our plates. Many of these pesticides are the modern day equivalent of DDT. However, scant research exists on the chemical soup of poisons that our children consume on a daily basis. As our food supply environment reels under the pressures of industrialization via agrochemicals, our kids have become the walking evidence of this failed experiment.&nbsp;<em>What&#x2019;s Making Our Children Sick? </em>exposes our current predicament and offers insight on the medical responses that are available, both to heal our kids and to reverse the compromised health of our food supply.</p></p><p><p> <strong>Michelle Perro, MD</strong>, is a veteran pediatrician with over thirty-five years of experience in acute and integrative medicine.

Smith, author of&nbsp;<em>Seeds of Deception</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Genetic Roulette</em>; codirector of <em>Secret Ingredients</em></strong></p><br><br><p><strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em>-</strong></p> <p>"Medical professionals join the debate over the safety of our food supply with the claim that toxic foods are causing hard-to-diagnose chronic health problems in children.Pediatrician Perro, former director of the pediatric emergency department at New York's Metropolitan Hospital and attending physician at Oakland Children's Hospital, and Adams (Vice Chair, Medical Anthropology/Univ. of California, San Francisco; Metrics: What Counts in Global Health, 2016, etc.) team up to document this phenomenon and to argue that the solution is a new model of ecomedicine that promotes the treatment value of healthy food. Genetically modified foods come in for especially close scrutiny. Perro's practice provides clinical case studies illustrating the many health problems of children&#x2015;allergies, asthma, rashes, gastrointestinal issues, autoimmune disorders, and cognitive malfunction&#x2015;that frustrated parents have brought to her attention and that she has successfully treated. The authors also delve into the rise of agrochemical technologies and the current practices of industrial food production, especially with regard to GMO crops. They explore what biomedical sciences are beginning to learn about the connection between pesticides and organ systems, and they question the effectiveness of American Medical Association guidelines for medical practice, which they assert do not reflect scientific information. Physicians, they write, must think beyond the pill. The ecomedicine model calls for a recognition that our internal ecosystems can only be as healthy as our external environmental ecosystems. In their demand for a revolution in our food production system, as well as in our medical approach to chronic disorders, the authors acknowledge the need for scientists, educators, politicians, health professionals, and farmers to become involved, but they single out mothers as powerful agents of change. An accessible read with a title designed to catch the attention of worried mothers and a message that will be vigorously challenged by a host of agribusiness and pharmaceutical industry spokespeople and segments of the medical profession.

The patient case histories that Dr. Perro and Dr. Adams describe in <em>What&#x2019;s Making Our Children Sick?</em> provide compelling evidence for advocating lifestyle changes, especially dietary medicine intervention, for overcoming these chronic ailments. And science increasingly provides explanations for such success. We now know that the balance of our gut bacteria (microbiome) is crucial to health and that imbalance, causing gut dysbiosis, is at least a contributing factor to a vast range of chronic illnesses, both physical and mental. Poor diet is no doubt a major contributory factor in causing gut dysbiosis. By eliminating pesticide and GMO-laden food from the diet and replacing it with organic wholefoods as part of her lifestyle medicine approach, Dr. Perro succeeds where standard pharmaceuticals fail. This should be enough for all to take note and follow suit.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Michael Antoniou, molecular geneticist, King&#x2019;s College London; coauthor of&nbsp;<em>GMO Myths and Truths</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;The sharp rise of severe allergies, brain disorders, and other chronic illnesses among America&#x2019;s children has left many doctors stumped, finding themselves unable to offer lasting cures or even successfully manage sometimes devastating symptoms.

Camruddin is a simple Macedonian soldier caught up in the Young Turk conspiracy to overthrow the Sultan. A romance with a girl from a Pasha s harem presents him with a desperate choice: to join the Jihad in the Balkan hills, or to enjoy his love and the patronage of a high Imperial official. The collapse of old Turkey, amid intimations of the birth of a new nation, is brilliantly depicted, as the humour and good-natured nobility of the Ottoman establishment totters under the hammer-blows of invasion and internal revolt.</p><p>Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthal was born in 1875 in London, to an Anglican clergyman, and spent his formative years in rural Suffolk.

In 1917, Pickthall reverted to Islam. A strong advocate of the Ottoman Empire, Pickthall studied the Orient, published articles and novels on the subject, best known for the English translation of the Qur&#39;an &#39; The meaning of the Holy Qur&#39;an&#39; While under the service of the Nizam of Hyderabad.

Combining the goals that William Bennett enumerated as Secretary of Education, key excerpts from E. D. Hirsch's Core Knowledge Sequence, and the latest research, it sets forth clear curricula and specific objectives for children from kindergarten through the eighth grade, including:<br> <br>-What children should be studying and the kind of work they should be doing<br> <br>-Important facts to learn and essential reading lists<br> <br>-When children should master specific math skills, spelling and grammar basics, and scientific facts<br> <br>-Test preparation, homework, and other areas that require parental involvement<br> <br><i>The Educated Child</i> also examines timely issues such as school choice, sex education, character education, and the phonics/whole language debate. Perhaps most important, it encourages parents to become advocates for their children by learning what to look for in a good school, how to talk to educators, and how, when necessary, to push for needed changes. For parents concerned about their children's current education and future lives, it is the ultimate handbook.</p><p>William J. Bennett, that doyen of common sense who brought us <i>The Book of Virtues</i>, has returned to the topic of child rearing, delivering a massive canon on the education of young children. He joins fellow veterans of the U.S. Department of Education Chester E. Finn Jr. and John T.E. Cribb Jr. in offering a traditional, back-to-basics resource for parents. <i>The Educated Child</i> is a tome to page through and return to as the years go by, with chapters divided by subjects and grade levels. One of the most helpful aspects of the guide is its outline of what to expect--or demand, in some cases--in the K-8 essentials. The writers list book titles, historic dates, science topics, and other issues that should be covered, borrowing heavily from E.D. Hirsch's Core Knowledge Series, the fact-specific book series that begins with <i>What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know</i>. <p> But Bennett et al.'s take on education goes further, with the authors weighing in on such controversial topics as sex education, TV, the Internet, self-esteem, and school uniforms with statements that largely reflect their conservative reputations. They also stick to the insistence that Western culture be emphasized in American classrooms. In some cases, however, the three don't always agree--acknowledging diverging views on year-round education, for instance. Some of what they cover is basic, instinctive stuff: we don't need another guide telling us to talk to our children about their school day. But there's valuable advice, too, such as how to save your child from a bad teacher and what questions to ask in a parent-teacher conference. For parents puzzled or overwhelmed by what the authors refer to as "the blob" of the education bureaucracy, <i>The Educated Child</i> can be a helpful insiders' view from those who once governed the biggest blob of all. <i>--Jodi Mailander Farrell</i></p>William J.

The uplifting tale follows the mysterious and magical events that transform the miserly, miserable Ebenezer Scrooge into &#x201c;as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man&#x201d; as ever lived.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>In the history of English literature, Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been continuously in print since it was first published in the winter of 1843, stands out as the quintessential Christmas story. What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>The Successful Investor: What 80 Million People Need to Know to Invest Profitably and Avoid Big Losses</h2><p><p><b>FROM THE AUTHOR OF THE <i>BUSINESSWEEK</i>, <i>USA TODAY</i>, AND <i>WALL STREET JOURNAL </i>BUSINESS BESTSELLER <i>HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN STOCKS!</i></b></p> <p><b>Simple-to-follow strategies for making--and keeping--profits in today's perilous stock market</b></p> <p>More than 80 million investors lost 50 to 80 percent of their savings in the recent stock market crash.

But beloved? Yet from its first appearance in 1926, <i>Fowler's</i> was just that. Henry Watson Fowler initially aimed his <i>Dictionary of Modern English Usage</i>, as he wrote to his publishers in 1911, at "the half-educated Englishman of literary proclivities who wants to know Can I say so-&amp;-so?" He was of course obsessed with, in Swift's phrase, "proper words in their proper places." But having been a schoolmaster, Fowler knew that liberal doses of style, wit, and caprice would keep his manual off the shelf and in writers' hands. He also felt that description must accompany prescription, and that advocating pedantic "superstitions" and "fetishes" would be to no one's advantage. Adepts will have their favorite inconsequential entries--from <i>burgle</i> to <i>brood</i>, <i>truffle</i> to <i>turgid</i>. Would that we could quote them all, but we can't resist a couple. Here Fowler lays into <i>dedicated</i>: <blockquote> <i>He is that</i> rara avis <i>a dedicated boxer</i>. The sporting correspondent who wrote this evidently does not see why the literary critics should have a monopoly of this favourite word of theirs, though he does not seem to think that it will be greatly needed in his branch of the business. </blockquote> Needless to say, later on <i>rara avis</i> is also smacked upside the head! And <i>practically</i> fares no better: "It is unfortunate that <i>practically</i> should have escaped from its true meaning into something like its opposite," Fowler begins. But our linguistic hero also knew full well when to put a crimp on comedy. Some phrases and proper uses, it's clear, would always be worth fighting for, and the guide thus ranges from brief definitions to involved articles. <i>Archaisms</i>, for instance, he considered safe only in the hands of the experienced, and meaningless words, especially those used by the young, "are perhaps more suitable for the psychologist than for the philologist." Well, youth might respond, "Whatever!"--though only after examining the keen differences between that phrase and <i>what ever</i>. (One can only imagine what Fowler would have made of our late-20th-century abuses of <i>like</i>.) This is where Robert Burchfield's 1996 third edition comes in. Yes, Fowler lost the fight for one <i>r</i> in <i>guerrilla</i> and didn't fare too well when it came to quashing such vogue words as <i>smear</i> and <i>seminal</i>. But he knew--and makes us ever aware--that language is a living, breathing (and occasionally suffocating) thing, and we hope that he would have welcomed any and all revisions. Fowlerphiles will want to keep their first (if they're very lucky) or second editions at hand, but should look to Burchfield for new entries on such phrases as <i>gay</i>, <i>iron curtain</i>, and <i>inchoate</i>--not to mention <i>girl</i>. <i>--Kerry Fried</i><br> Henry Watson Fowler (1858-1933) was a translator, lexicographer, and grammarian. With his brother Frank (1870-1918) he compiled the first edition of the Concise Oxford Dictionary (published 1911) and the Pocket Oxford Dictionary (published in 1924, after Franks' death). Frank helped to plan Modern English Usage with his brother but he died before it was published and it was executed by Henry alone. The name Fowler has become synonymous with reliable and accurate reference on all aspects of written English. <br></p><h2>The Unofficial Bible for Minecrafters: Life of Jesus: Stories from the Bible told block by block</h2><p>Unofficial Bible for Minecrafters Life of Jesus</p><p></p><h2>Still Writing: The Perils and Pleasures of a Creative Life</h2><p><i> Everything I know about life, I learned from the daily practice of sitting down to write.&#x201d;</i><br><br>From the best-selling author of <i>Devotion</i> and<i> Slow Motion</i> comes a witty, heartfelt, and practical look at the exhilarating and challenging process of storytelling.

If I were to give you a list of all the facts of my early life that made me a writer, this one would be near the top. Only child. Older parents. It now seems almost like a job requirement though back then, I wished it to be otherwise. A lonely, isolated childhood isn&#x2019;t a prerequisite for a writing life, but it certainly helped. My parents were observant Jews. We kept a Kosher home, and didn&#x2019;t drive on the Sabbath, from sundown on Friday evening until sundown on Saturday. We didn&#x2019;t turn on lights, or the radio, or television. I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to ride my bike, or play the piano. Or do homework. This left me with a lot of time to do nothing. (Time to do nothing, by the way, is also very useful though boring training for the life of the writer.) Most Saturday mornings, I walked a half-mile to synagogue with my father while my mother stayed home with a sinus headache.<br> <br>Our house was silent and spotless. Dirt, smudges, noise any kind of disarray would have been unthinkably dangerous. Housekeepers were always quitting. No one could keep the house to my mother's standards. Every surface gleamed. Picture frames were dusted daily. Sheets and pillowcases were ironed three times a week. My drawers were color-coordinated, blue Danskin tops perfectly folded next to blue Danskin bottoms. The exterminator came monthly. The toxic mold guy made biannual visits. Summers, the lawn man came with his mower and hedge trimmer, keeping every bit of our suburban New Jersey acre under control. <br><br>Control was important. It wasn't really the messiness of life that we were girding ourselves against. Secrets floated through our home like dust motes in the air. Every word spoken by my parents contained within it a hidden hard kernel of what wasn't being said. Though I couldn't have expressed it, I knew with a child's instincts that life itself was seen by both my parents as a teeming, seething, frightful hall of mirrors. Something had made them scared. They tried to protect me from themselves, from their own histories der kinder, one of them would whisper harshly and they'd stop talking after I entered the room. I loved my parents, but I didn't want to be like them. I didn&#x2019;t want to be afraid of life. The trouble was, it was all I knew. <br><br>And so I spent my childhood straining to hear. With no siblings to distract me, I had plenty of time on my hands, and eavesdropped and snooped in every way I could devise. I lurked outside doorways, crouched on staircase landings. I fiddled with the intercom system in our house, attempting to tune into rooms where one or both of my parents might be. I riffled through filing cabinets when my parents were out to dinner and the babysitter was downstairs watching "The Partridge Family". I haunted my mother's closets, the cashmere sweaters in individual plastic garment bags, the shoes and purses in their original boxes. What was I hoping to find? A clue. A reason. We had two telephone lines, and one of them had a little doohicky that you could lift up, preventing anyone from picking up another extension and listening in. I noticed that whenever my mother was on the phone, she used this doohicky. What was she saying that I wasn&#x2019;t meant to hear? <br><br>I didn't know that this spying was the beginning of my literary education. That the need to know, to discover, to peel away the surface was actually a good training ground for who and what I would grow up to become. The idea of becoming a writer was more remote to me than becoming an astronaut. I didn't know any writers. Our suburban New Jersey neighborhood wasn&#x2019;t an artistic hotbed. I didn't draw parallels between the books I loved, and read every night under the covers with a flashlight, and the idea that someone a woman, say, alone in a room, wrestling with words and thoughts and ideas could actually spend her life writing them.<br> <br>I slunk around like a detective. I learned to hide on the staircase without making a sound. I was determined to uncover and understand the sources of my parents' pain, though it would be many years a lifetime before I would begin to make sense of it. All I knew was this: life seemed sad. It seemed parched, fruitless. By the time I was eleven or twelve, I escaped into my room and began to write. I discovered the world of my imagination where I was free of my father&#x2019;s sadness, my mother&#x2019;s headaches. I was free from the sense that my parents were disappointed in each other, and from my fear that they would be disappointed in me. I was free from der kinder!, and the Sabbath rules. I closed and locked my bedroom door take that, parents! and I made up stories. Sometimes I wrote them as letters to friends. Sometimes I pretended every word was true.<br><br>Deep down, I wondered if I might be crazy.<br><br>I had no idea that I was exhibiting all the signs of becoming a writer.<br><br><b>Riding the Wave<br></b><br>Here&#x2019;s a short list of what not to do when you sit down to write. Don&#x2019;t answer the phone. Don&#x2019;t look at email. Don&#x2019;t go on the internet for any reason, including checking spelling of some obscure word, or what you might think of as research, but is really a fancy form of procrastination. Do you need to know the exact make and year of the car your character is driving? Do you need to know which exit on the Interstate has a rest stop? Can it wait? It can almost always wait. On the list of other, less fancy procrastinations, especially when the urge to leap up from your desk, accompanied by a wild surge of energy, comes just at the moment when you might actually begin writing: laundry, baking, marketing, filling out insurance claims, writing thank you notes, cleaning closets, sorting files, weeding, scrubbing, polishing, arranging, removing stains, bathing the dog.<br><br>Sit down. Stay there. It&#x2019;s hard believe me, I know just how hard it is, and I hate to tell you this, but it doesn&#x2019;t get easier. Ever. Get used to the discomfort. Make some kind of peace with it. Several years ago, I decided to learn how to meditate, though I thought, as many do, that I&#x2019;d be bad at it: I can't stop thinking for more than two seconds. I don't have the patience. I'm too Type A. I can't sit still. But I needed something that would get me away from my desk and, at the same time, bring me peace and clarity. All of my writer friends have a version of this: my friend Jenny runs. John cooks barbecue. Mary swims. Ann knits. These are meditative acts ones which allow the mind to roam, and ultimately to rest. When I sit down to meditate, I feel much the same way as I do when I sit down to write: resistant, fidgety, anxious, eager, cranky, despairing, hopeful, my mind jammed so full of ideas, my heart so full of feelings that it seems impossible to contain them. And yet if I do just sit there without checking the clock, without answering the ringing phone, without jumping up to make a note of an all-important task, then slowly the random thoughts pinging around my mind begin to settle. If I allow myself, I begin to see what&#x2019;s really going on. Like a snow globe, that flurry of white floats down. <br><br>During the time devoted to your writing, think of the surges of energy coursing through your body as waves. They will come, they will crash over you, and then they will go. You&#x2019;ll still be sitting there. Nothing terrible will have happened. Try not to run from the wave. If, at one moment, you are sitting quietly at your desk, and then fugue state alert! you are suddenly on your knees planting tulips, or perusing your favorite online shopping website, and you don&#x2019;t know how you got there, then the wave has won. We don&#x2019;t want the wave to win. We want to recognize it, to accept the wave&#x2019;s power and perhaps even learn to ride it. We want to learn to tolerate those wild feelings, because everything we need to know, everything valuable, is contained within them. <br><br><b>Inner Censor<br></b><br>Sometimes, when I&#x2019;m teaching, I&#x2019;ll start to talk to my students about the nasty little two-timing frenemy of everyone who struggles to put words down on the page and, without even realizing I&#x2019;m doing it, I&#x2019;ll start gesturing to my left shoulder. Never my right, always my left. That&#x2019;s apparently where my censor sits. She has been in residence on my left shoulder for so many years that it&#x2019;s a wonder I&#x2019;m not completely lopsided.<br><br>Here are some of the things she whispers, or shouts, depending on her mood, whenever I'm beginning something new: <br><br>This is stupid.<br>What a waste of time.<br>(Condescending laugh)<br>You really think you can pull that off?<br>So-and-so did it better. <br>Are you ready for a nap? I sure am. <br><br>My inner censor wants to shut me down. She wants me to close up shop, like the man in one of my favorite New Yorker cartoons, who stands in the left frame, staring out a window looking bored, resigned. This frame is titled Writer's Block: Temporary. The right frame shows him standing in the exact same way; nothing has changed, except now he's in front of a fish store bearing his name. The title? Writer's Block: Permanent. My censor wants no less than to turn me into a fish salesman. Not that there's anything wrong with selling fish, except that I don't know anything about selling fish and, quite honestly, am not fond of the way it smells. What I do know -what I've spent the past couple of decades learning about myself is that if I'm not writing, I'm not well. If I'm not writing, the world around me is slowly leached of its color. My senses are dulled. I am crabby with my husband, short-tempered with my kid, and more inclined to see small things wrong with my house (the crack in the ceiling, the smudge-prints along the staircase wall) than look out the window at the blazing maple tree, the family of geese making its way across our driveway. If I&#x2019;m not writing, my heart hardens, rather than lifts.<br><br>And so I have learned how get out of my censor&#x2019;s way. It doesn&#x2019;t happen by fighting her. It happens first by recognizing her oh, hello, it&#x2019;s you again and being willing to co-exist. Like those bumper stickers most often seen on the backs of Priuses spelling out co-exist in the symbols of all the world&#x2019;s religions, the writer and her inner censor also need to learn to get along. The I.C., once you're on a nickname basis, should be treated like an annoying, potentially undermining colleague. Try managing her with corporate-speak: Thanks for reaching out, but can I circle back to you later? <br><br>The daily discipline of this creates a muscle memory. It becomes ingrained, thereby habit. I try to remember this, each morning, as I make the solitary trek from the kitchen to my desk. My house is quiet. My family is gone. The hours stretch ahead of me. The beds have been made, the dogs have been walked. There is nothing stopping me. Nothing, except for the toxic little troll sitting on my left shoulder. Just when I think I have her beat, she will assume a new disguise. I have to be vigilant, on-the-ready. She will pretend to be well-intentioned. She&#x2019;s telling me for my own good. <br><br>Maybe you should try writing something more commercial.<br><br>You know, thrillers are hot. Why not write a thriller? Or at least a mystery? <br><br>Sweetheart (I hate it when she calls me sweetheart) no one wants to read a book about a depressed old man. Or a dysfunctional mother and daughter. Why not write a book with a strong female protagonist, for a change? You know, a super-heroine. Someone less I don&#x2019;t know victimy?<br><br>Under the guise of being helpful, or honest, my censor, and, I&#x2019;m hazarding a guess, yours as well, is like a guided missile aiming at every little nook and cranny where I am at my weakest and most vulnerable. She will stoop and connive. She knows no shame. All she wants to do is stop me from entering that sacred space from which the work springs. She is at her most insidious when I am at the beginning, because she knows that once I have begun, she will lose her power over me. And so I dip my toe into the stream. I feel the rush of words there. Words that are like a thousands silvery minnows, below the surface, rushing by. If I don&#x2019;t capture them, they will be lost.</p><h2>Revolution in Poetic Language (European Perspectives Series)</h2><p><p>The linking of psychosomatic to literary and literary to a larger political horizon raises the question of conservative premises to linguistic, pyschoanalystic, philisophical, and literary theories and criticisms of such.</p></p><p>Julia Kristeva is an internationally known psychoanalyst and critic, is Professor of Linguistics at the University de Paris VII and chief proponent of semanalyse, a term she coined to name the discipline that blends semiotics with pyschoanalysis.Noted by the San Fransisco Chronicle-Examiner as a woman whose writings demonstrate "her amazing command of history, politics, literature, linguistics, and psychoogy," Kristeva recently hosted a French television series and is the author of many critically acclaimed books published by Columbia University Press in translation, including <i>Time and Sense: Proust and the Experience of Literature</i> and the novel, <i>Possessions.</i>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Chevrolet Sprint &amp; Geo Metro 1985-2001 (Haynes Manuals)</h2><p>Technical Repair Manual.

To be or not to be, may be the question, but the answer has eluded many generations of critics. What does it mean to be? And is everything as it seems to be? These are the questions that are asked and answered in the introduction by Joseph Pearce, author of The Quest for Shakespeare, and in the tradition-oriented critical essays by leading Shakespeare scholars that can be found in this groundbreaking edition of Shakespeare&#39;s masterpiece. To see or not to see, that is the question. The Ignatius Critical Edition of Hamlet will help many people truly see the play and its deepest meaning in a new and surprising light.</p><p>Popularly known as the &#39;Bard of Avon&#39;, English playwright, poet, and actor William Shakespeare was baptised on 26 April 1564. Not much is known about his date of birth or his formal education. Born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, he moved to London at age 21, where he wrote and acted in plays like Hamlet and As You Like It for the theatre group &#39;The King&#39;s Men&#39;. Shakespeare, who died on 23 April 1616, gave the English language its most beautiful figures of speech, allegories, and images.</p><h2>Twelfth Night (The Pelican Shakespeare)</h2><p><b>The acclaimed Pelican Shakespeare series, now in a dazzling new series design<br><br>Winner of the 2016 AIGA + Design Observer 50 Books | 50 Covers competition</b><br>&nbsp;<br>This edition of&nbsp;<i>Twelfth Night</i>&nbsp;is edited with an introduction by Jonathan Crewe&nbsp;and was recently repackaged with cover art by Manuja Waldia.&nbsp;Waldia received a Gold Medal from the Society of Illustrators for the Pelican Shakespeare series.<br> &nbsp;<br> The legendary Pelican Shakespeare series features authoritative and meticulously researched texts paired with scholarship by renowned Shakespeareans.

While everyone knows the new White Star liner was glamorous, full of millionaires when she sank, few appreciate just how luxurious she was. Even in Third Class, the accommodation was better than on First Class on many older ships. For the first time, Bruce Beveridge, Steve Hall, Scott Andrews and Daniel Klistorner look at the construction and exterior of the ship itself, and at her interior design and fittings. From cobalt blue Spode china and Elkington plate silverware in the � la carte restaurant to the design of the boilers and fixtures and fittings on board the world&#x2019;s most luxurious vessel, they tell the story of a liner built at the peak of the race between the British, French and Germans to build bigger and better ships</p><p>BRUCE BEVERIDGE (US) has been a historian for many years, centring on early civilisations, the Crusades, and famous ships. He is also the senior historical archivist for his local community library and spends his time away from Titanic working on local history projects. Bruce is one of the foremost visual and technical historians of the Olympic class ships and has advised on Titanic&#x2019;s specifications for exhibitions, publishing companies, professional modelling firms, the Danbury Mint, museums, television production companies, the auction firm of Henry Aldridge &amp; Son and other organisations. Bruce&#x2019;s highly sought-after General Arrangement plan of the ship, released in 2003, is the most highly detailed and accurate plan released to date and has subsequently been used by dive teams investigating the wreck. He co-authored Titanic or Olympic &#x2013; The Truth Behind the Conspiracy in 2004, Titanic in Photographs and the Report into the Loss of the SS Titanic: A Centennial Reappraisal in 2011.SCOTT ANDREWS (US) first became aware of the story of Titanic at the age of four when he was captivated by a picture of the ship published in Reader&#x2019;s Digest as part of a condensed version of Walter Lord&#x2019;s A Night to Remember. Between having it read to him and then seeing the J. Arthur Rank movie of the same name, he admits he became thoroughly and hopelessly hooked. Scott&#x2019;s primary interest in Titanic centres on the engineering aspects of the ship &#x2013; her design, construction and propulsion machinery. He is a trustee of the Titanic Research and Modeling Association, and also co-authored Titanic in Photographs. His interests outside Titanic include pipe organs and organ building and restoring antique cars.STEVE HALL lives in the small coastal town of Angels Beach in New South Wales, Australia. He is a renowned Titanic visual historian, having collected, studied and researched the ship&#x2019;s photographic record for over three decades. He has consulted to the media, auction houses and museums around the world and holds one of the largest private collections of Titanic photographs in the world. He has co-authored several landmark books on the subject, including Titanic or Olympic &#x2013; The Truth Behind the Conspiracy (2004), Titanic in Photographs (2011) and Report into the Loss of the SS Titanic: A Centennial Reappraisal (2011). He retired from the information technology industry several years ago and devotes his spare time toward writing a series of children&#x2019;s novels.DANIEL KLISTORNER developed an interest in Titanic during the early 1990s after reading a newspaper article about an expedition to the wreck. Daniel&#x2019;s interest in Titanic centres around passengers and accommodations. His research of exacting details has been the key to his comprehensive understanding of Titanic&#x2019;s passenger areas, interiors and fittings as well and he is a recognised authority in this area, particularly the first class staterooms and their styles of design. He has provided consultation for several authors and auction houses as well as Bruce Beveridge&#x2019;s General Arrangement plans of the ship, and is a co-author of Titanic in Photographs. Daniel resides in Sydney, Australia, and is an avid traveller.ART BRAUNSCHWEIGER has had a long-standing interest in maritime and naval history, focusing on the British Navy of the period 1750&#x2013;1820, Second World War submarine warfare in the Pacific, the Atlantic convoys of the Second World War and, of course, Titanic. He has consulted for TIME-LIFE books on Titanic and has authored several research articles in print and online.

More than anything, Patsy wishes to be reunited with her oldest friend, Cicely, whose letters arrive from New York steeped in the promise of a happier life and the possible rekindling of their young love. But Patsy&#x2019;s plans don&#x2019;t include her overzealous, evangelical mother&#x2015;or even her five-year-old daughter, Tru.<br><br> Beating with the pulse of a long-witheld confession, <em>Patsy</em> gives voice to a woman who looks to America for the opportunity to choose herself first&#x2015;not to give a better life to her family back home. Patsy leaves Tru behind in a defiant act of self-preservation, hoping for a new start where she can be, and love, whomever she wants. But when Patsy arrives in Brooklyn, America is not as Cicely&#x2019;s treasured letters described; to survive as an undocumented immigrant, she is forced to work as a bathroom attendant and nanny. Meanwhile, Tru builds a faltering relationship with her father back in Jamaica, grappling with her own questions of identity and sexuality, and trying desperately to empathize with her mother&#x2019;s decision.<br><br> Expertly evoking the jittery streets of New York and the languid rhythms of Jamaica, <em>Patsy</em> weaves between the lives of Patsy and Tru in vignettes spanning more than a decade as mother and daughter ultimately find a way back to one another.<br><br> As with her masterful debut, <em>Here Comes the Sun</em>, Nicole Dennis-Benn once again charts the geography of a hidden world&#x2015;that of a paradise lost, swirling with the echoes of lilting patois, in which one woman fights to discover her sense of self in a world that tries to define her. Passionate, moving, and fiercely urgent, Patsy is a prismatic depiction of immigration and womanhood, and the lasting threads of love stretching across years and oceans.</p><p>Nicole Dennis-Benn is a Lambda Literary Award winner and New York Foundation for the Arts Artist Fellowship recipient. She's also a finalist for the 2016 John Leonard Prize National Book Critics Circle Award, the 2016 Center for Fiction First Novel Prize, and the 2017 Young Lions Fiction Award for her debut novel, Here Comes the Sun-- a New York Times Notable Book of the year, an NPR, Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble Best Book of 2016.

I think particularly now, it&#x2019;s critical that we open our minds to the way others live.... At the end this is a beautiful story of love.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jenna Bush Hager, NBC's <i>TODAY</i> #ReadWithJenna Book Club Selection</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Nicole Dennis-Benn carefully unspools the stories behind each wound over the long course of this richly imagined novel... [she] beautifully illustrates how the characters are connected to one another by love, desire and violence, and how they bear those histories permanently, both within and on their bodies. [<em>Patsy</em>] continually and subtly defies predictability as it tells a vital and remarkable life story.... I never knew what turn the story would take next, how the past would reassert itself, what alliances and rifts would form, where love would fail and where it would unexpectedly appear. Again and again, <em>Patsy</em> surprises and illuminates.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Chelsey Johnson, <em>New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Sumptuous... Dennis-Benn ingeniously humanizes and changes up the typical immigrant saga... The result is a knowing, at times painfully funny novel about the disorienting relationship between selfhood and sacrifice.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>O, The Oprah Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Stunning.... <em>Patsy</em> fills a literary void with compassion, complexity and tenderness.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joshunda Sanders, <em>TIME</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Admirers of <em>Here Comes the Sun</em> have waited three years for Dennis-Benn's followup, and anyone who was enchanted by her gorgeous writing are in for a happy surprise: <em>Patsy</em> isn't just as good as its predecessor, it's somehow even better.... Dennis-Benn isn't just a compassionate writer, she's also a courageous one, unafraid to address topics that too often go ignored. And in Patsy and Tru, she's managed to create two unforgettable characters who function as real people and not literary archetypes. Dennis-Benn is quickly becoming an indispensable novelist, and <em>Patsy</em> is a brave, brilliant triumph of a book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Schaub, <em>NPR</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Nicole Dennis-Benn&#x2019;s sophomore novel, <em>Patsy</em>, methodically and unapologetically engages with choices women do and should be allowed to make, and as with her last novel, <em>Here Comes the Sun</em>, does so with nuance and grace.... <em>Patsy</em> is a deeply queer, sensitive and vividly written novel about a woman&#x2019;s right to want and a child&#x2019;s right to carve her own path.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ilana Masad, <em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Dennis-Benn writes about the immigrant experience with abiding, bone-deep empathy&#x2015;swinging between standard English and patois the same way that Patsy and her daughter navigate their own need to code-switch as the years pass. Estranged from one another and bound to a world that tends to treat black womanhood and queer sexuality as invisible at best, their separate but intertwined stories wend through hurt and hope and inalienable dreams; not just for a better life, but a truly honest one.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Leah Greenblatt, <em>Entertainment Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Brilliant... [Dennis-Benn] writes with keen awareness of what others experience living undocumented in America&#x2015;and the compromises that women make in order to prioritize themselves.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Elle</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Dennis-Benn gives her characters the dose of happiness and self-assurance that many stories about social ills refuse women like them. She does that without facilely wishing away the big issues&#x2015;racism, homophobia, gender, classism&#x2015;that her novel tackles. <em>Patsy</em> is a portrait of black queer women grasping for self-determination, and a challenge to the conventions of what is expected of good mothers and good women and good immigrants.... In writing beautifully about that unending struggle, Dennis-Benn finds a way to extend to black girls and women some of the love that the world may never offer.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Adrienne Green, <em>The Atlantic</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;While <em>Patsy</em> highlights the profound, and often unseen, sacrifices made in immigrants&#x2019; lives in America, it also emphasizes the struggles of those who are LGBTQIA+.... In the end, Dennis-Benn touches upon the question of whether or not America is even still the promised land for all identities seeking freedom from persecution.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>C.E.

Mommy! Mommy is asleep on the floor. She has been asleep for a long time. I brush her hair because she likes that. She doesn&#x2019;t wake up. I shake her. Mommy! My tummy hurts. It is hungry. He isn&#x2019;t here. I am thirsty. In the kitchen I pull a chair to the sink, and I have a drink. The water splashes over my blue sweater. Mommy is still asleep. Mommy wake up! She lies still. She is cold. I fetch my blankie, and I cover Mommy, and I lie down on the sticky green rug beside her. Mommy is still asleep. I have two toy cars. They race by the floor where Mommy is sleeping. I think Mommy is sick. I search for something to eat. In the freezer I find peas. They are cold. I eat them slowly. They make my tummy hurt. I sleep beside Mommy. The peas are gone. In the freezer is something. It smells funny. I lick it and my tongue is stuck to it. I eat it slowly. It tastes nasty. I drink some water. I play with my cars, and I sleep beside Mommy. Mommy is so cold, and she won&#x2019;t wake up. The door crashes open. I cover Mommy with my blankie. He&#x2019;s here. <i>Fuck. What the fuck happened here? Oh, the crazy fucked-up bitch. Shit. Fuck. Get out of my way, you little shit.</i> He kicks me, and I hit my head on the floor. My head hurts. He calls somebody and he goes. He locks the door. I lay down beside Mommy. My head hurts. The lady policeman is here. No. No. No. Don&#x2019;t touch me. Don&#x2019;t touch me. Don&#x2019;t touch me. I stay by Mommy. No. Stay away from me. The lady policeman has my blankie, and she grabs me. I scream. Mommy! Mommy! I want my mommy. The words are gone. I can&#x2019;t say the words. Mommy can&#x2019;t hear me.

My husband&#x2014;my hot, beautiful husband, shirtless and in cut-off jeans&#x2014;is reading a book predicting the collapse of the Western banking system. By all accounts, it&#x2019;s a page-turner. I haven&#x2019;t seen him sit this still, ever. He looks more like a student than the hotshot CEO of one of the top privately owned companies in the United States.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the final leg of our honeymoon, we laze in the afternoon sun on the beach of the aptly named Beach Plaza Monte Carlo in Monaco, although we&#x2019;re not actually staying in this hotel. I open my eyes and gaze out at the <i>Fair Lady</i> anchored in the harbor. We are staying, of course, on board a luxury motor yacht. Built in 1928, she floats majestically on the water, queen of all the yachts in the harbor. She looks like a child&#x2019;s wind-up toy. Christian loves her&#x2014;I suspect he&#x2019;s tempted to buy her. Honestly, boys and their toys.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sitting back, I listen to the Christian Grey mix on my new iPod and doze in the late afternoon sun, idly remembering his proposal. Oh, his dreamy proposal in the boathouse . . . I can almost smell the scent of the meadow flowers . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> -----<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Can we marry tomorrow?&#x201d; Christian murmurs softly in my ear. I am sprawled on his chest in the flowery bower in the boathouse, sated from our passionate lovemaking.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is that a yes?&#x201d; I hear his hopeful surprise.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A no?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I sense his grin. &#x201c;Miss Steele, are you incoherent?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I grin. &#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He laughs and hugs me tightly, kissing the top of my head. &#x201c;Vegas, tomorrow, it is then.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sleepily I raise my head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think my parents would be very happy with that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He thrums his fingertips up and down my naked back, caressing me gently.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do you want, Anastasia? Vegas? A big wedding with all the trimmings? Tell me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not big . . . Just friends and family.&#x201d; I gaze up at him, moved by the quiet entreaty in his glowing gray eyes. <i>What does he want?</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; He nods. &#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I shrug.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Could we do it here?&#x201d; he asks tentatively.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your folks&#x2019; place? Would they mind?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He snorts. &#x201c;My mother would be in seventh heaven.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, here. I&#x2019;m sure my mom and dad would prefer that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He strokes my hair. Could I be any happier?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So, we&#x2019;ve established where, now the when.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Surely you should ask your mother.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d; Christian&#x2019;s smile dips. &#x201c;She can have a month, that&#x2019;s it. I want you too much to wait any longer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Christian, you have me. You&#x2019;ve had me for a while. But okay&#x2014;a month it is.&#x201d; I kiss his chest, a soft chaste kiss, and smile up at him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> -----<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll burn,&#x201d; Christian whispers in my ear, startling me from my doze.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only for you.&#x201d; I give him my sweetest smile. The late afternoon sun has shifted, and I am under its full glare. He smirks and in one swift move pulls my sun lounge into the shade of the parasol.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Out of the Mediterranean sun, Mrs. Grey.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thank you for your altruism, Mr. Grey.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My pleasure, Mrs. Grey, and I&#x2019;m not being altruistic at all. If you burn, I won&#x2019;t be able to touch you.&#x201d; He raises an eyebrow, his eyes shining with mirth, and my heart expands. &#x201c;But I suspect you know that and you&#x2019;re laughing at me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Would I?&#x201d; I gasp, feigning innocence.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, you would and you do. Often. It&#x2019;s one of the many things I love about you.&#x201d; He leans down and kisses me, playfully biting my lower lip.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I was hoping you&#x2019;d rub me down with more sunscreen.&#x201d; I pout against his lips.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mrs. Grey, it&#x2019;s a dirty job . . . but that&#x2019;s an offer I can&#x2019;t refuse. Sit up,&#x201d; he orders, his voice husky. I do as I&#x2019;m told, and with slow meticulous strokes from strong and supple fingers, he coats me in sunscreen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You really are very lovely. I&#x2019;m a lucky man,&#x201d; he murmurs as his fingers skim over my breasts, spreading the lotion.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, you are, Mr. Grey.&#x201d; I gaze coyly up at him through my lashes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Modesty becomes you, Mrs. Grey. Turn over. I want to do your back.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Smiling, I roll over, and he undoes the back strap of my hideously expensive bikini.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How would you feel if I went topless, like the other women on the beach?&#x201d; I ask.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Displeased,&#x201d; he says without hesitation. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not very happy about you wearing so little right now.&#x201d; He leans down and whispers in my ear. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t push your luck.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is that a challenge, Mr. Grey?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s a statement of fact, Mrs. Grey.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I sigh and shake my head. <i>Oh, Christian . . . my possessive, jealous, control freak Christian.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> When he&#x2019;s finished, he slaps my behind.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do, wench.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His ever-present, ever-active BlackBerry buzzes. I frown and he smirks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My eyes only, Mrs. Grey.&#x201d; He raises his eyebrow in playful warning, slaps my backside once more, and sits back down on his lounger to take the call.<br> &nbsp;<br> My inner goddess purrs. Maybe tonight we could do some kind of floor show for his eyes only. She smirks knowingly, arching a brow. I grin at the thought and drift back into my afternoon siesta.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;Mam&#x2019;selle? Un Perrier pour moi, un Coca-Cola light pour ma femme, s&#x2019;il vous plait. Et quelque chose a manger . . . laissezmoi voir la carte.&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Hmm . . . Christian speaking fluent French wakes me. My eyelashes flutter in the glare of the sun, and I find Christian watching me while a liveried young woman walks away, her tray held aloft, her high blonde ponytail swinging provocatively.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thirsty?&#x201d; he asks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I mutter sleepily.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I could watch you all day. Tired?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I flush. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t get much sleep last night.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Me neither.&#x201d; He grins, puts down his BlackBerry, and stands. His shorts fall a little and hang . . . in that way so his swim trunks are visible beneath. Christian takes his shorts off, stepping out of his flip-flops. I lose my train of thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come for a swim with me.&#x201d; He holds out his hand while I look up at him, dazed. &#x201c;Swim?&#x201d; he says again, cocking his head to one side, an amused expression on his face. When I don&#x2019;t respond, he shakes his head slowly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I think you need a wake-up call.&#x201d; Suddenly he pounces and lifts me into his arms while I shriek, more from surprise than alarm.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Christian! Put me down!&#x201d; I squeal.<br> &nbsp;<br> He chuckles. &#x201c;Only in the sea, baby.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Several sunbathers on the beach watch with that bemused disinterest so typical, I now realize, of the French, as Christian carries me to the sea, laughing, and wades in.<br> &nbsp;<br> I clasp my arms around his neck. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I say breathlessly, trying to stifle my giggling.<br> &nbsp;<br> He grins. &#x201c;Oh, Ana, baby, have you learned nothing in the short time we&#x2019;ve known each other?&#x201d; He kisses me, and I seize my opportunity, running my fingers through his hair, grasping two handfuls and kissing him back while invading his mouth with my tongue. He inhales sharply and leans back, eyes smoky but wary.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know your game,&#x201d; he whispers and slowly sinks into the cool, clear water, taking me with him as his lips find mine once more. The chill of the Mediterranean is soon forgotten as I wrap myself around my husband.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I thought you wanted to swim,&#x201d; I murmur against his mouth.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re very distracting.&#x201d; Christian grazes his teeth along my lower lip. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not sure I want the good people of Monte Carlo to see my wife in the throes of passion.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I run my teeth along his jaw, his stubble tickly against my tongue, not caring a dime for the good people of Monte Carlo.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ana,&#x201d; he groans. He wraps my ponytail around his wrist and tugs gently, tilting my head back, exposing my throat. He trails kisses from my ear down my neck.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Shall I take you in the sea?&#x201d; he breathes. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I whisper.<br> &nbsp;<br> Christian pulls away and gazes down at me, his eyes warm, wanting, and amused. &#x201c;Mrs. Grey, you&#x2019;re insatiable and so brazen. What sort of monster have I created?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A monster fit for you. Would you have me any other way?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you any way I can get you, you know that. But not right now. Not with an audience.&#x201d; He jerks his head toward the shore.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>What?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Sure enough, several sunbathers on the beach have aban-doned their indifference and now regard us with interest. Suddenly, Christian grabs me around my waist and launches me into the air, letting me fall into the water and sink beneath the waves to the soft sand below. I surface, coughing, spluttering, and giggling.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Christian!&#x201d; I scold, glaring at him. I thought we were going to make love in the sea . . . and chalk up yet another first. He bites his lower lip to stifle his amusement. I splash him, and he splashes me right back.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have all night,&#x201d; he says, grinning like a fool. &#x201c;Laters, baby.&#x201d; He dives beneath the sea and surfaces three feet away from me, then in a fluid, graceful crawl, swims away from the shore, away from me.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Gah! Playful, tantalizing Fifty!</i> I shield my eyes from the sun as I watch him go. He&#x2019;s such a tease . . . what can I do to get him back? While I swim to the shore, I contemplate my options. At the lounges our drinks have arrived, and I take a quick sip of Diet Coke. Christian is a faint speck in the distance.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Hmm . . .</i> I lie down on my front and, fumbling with the straps, take my bikini top off and toss it casually onto Christian&#x2019;s sun lounge. There . . . see how brazen I can be, Mr. Grey. Put this in your pipe and smoke it. I shut my eyes and let the sun warm my skin . . . warm my bones, and I drift away under its heat, my thoughts turning to my wedding day.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> -----<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You may kiss the bride,&#x201d; Reverend Walsh announces.<br> &nbsp;<br> I beam at my husband.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Finally, you&#x2019;re mine,&#x201d; he whispers and pulls me into his arms and kisses me chastely on the lips.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am married. I am Mrs. Christian Grey. I am giddy with joy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You look beautiful, Ana,&#x201d; he murmurs and smiles, his eyes glowing with love . . . and something darker, something hot. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let anyone take that dress off but me, understand?&#x201d; His smile heats a hundred degrees as his fingertips trail down my cheek, igniting my blood.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Holy crap . . . How does he do this, even here with all these people staring at us?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I nod mutely. Jeez, I hope no one can hear us. Luckily Reverend Walsh has discreetly stepped back. I glance at the throng gathered in their wedding finery . . . My mom, Ray, Bob, and the Greys are all applauding&#x2014;even Kate, my maid of honor, who looks stunning in pale pink as she stands beside Christian&#x2019;s best man, his brother Elliot. Who knew that even Elliot could scrub up so well? All wear huge, beaming smiles&#x2014;except Grace, who weeps graciously into a dainty white handkerchief.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ready to party, Mrs. Grey?&#x201d; Christian murmurs, giving me his shy smile. I melt. He looks divine in a simple black tux with silver waistcoat and tie. He&#x2019;s so . . . <i>dashing.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ready as I&#x2019;ll ever be.&#x201d; I grin, a totally goofy smile on my face.<br> &nbsp;<br> Later the wedding party is in full swing . . . Carrick and Grace have gone to town. They have the tent set up again and beautifully decorated in pale pink, silver, and ivory with its sides open, facing the bay. We have been blessed with fine weather, and the late afternoon sun shines over the water. There&#x2019;s a dance floor at one end of the tent, a lavish buffet at the other.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ray and my mother are dancing and...</p><h2>The Seeker</h2><p><p><b>'The Seeker is Winner of the 2015 CWA Endeavour Historical Dagger'</b></p> <p>London, 1654.

Wattles introduced the world to the power of positive thinking. He was a profound influence on Michael Losier and James Arthur Ray. With out Wattles &#34;Science Of&#34; trilogy there never would have been books such as The Secret, The Laws of Attraction, and the Power of Positive Thinking. Now you can go directly to the source with this easy to understand lesson book on using the Laws of Attraction to attract wealth. A Thrifty Book is a well designed, easy to read book at an unbeatable price.</p><p>This classic Wallace D. Wattles title has often been compared to Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, and many believe they act as excellent companion titles. Individuals who have read books by Robert Allen, Suze Orman or David Bach will find often find this title to as well be of interest.The man who owns all he wants for the living of all the life he is capable of living is rich; and no man who has not plenty of money can have all he wants. Life has advanced so far, and become so complex, that even the most ordinary man or woman requires a great amount of wealth in order to live in a manner that even approaches completeness. Every person naturally wants to become all that they are capable of becoming; this desire to realize innate possibilities is inherent in human nature; we cannot help wanting to be all that we can be. Success in life is becoming what you want to be; you can become what you want to be only by making use of things, and you can have the free use of things only as you become rich enough to buy them. To understand the science of getting rich is therefore the most essential of all knowledge. <p>In writing this book I have sacrificed all other considerations to plainness and simplicity of style, so that all might understand. The plan of action laid down herein was deduced from the conclusions of philosophy; it has been thoroughly tested, and bears the supreme test of practical experiment; it works. If you wish to know how the conclusions were arrived at, read the writings of the authors mentioned above; and if you wish to reap the fruits of their philosophies in actual practice, read this book and do exactly as it tells you to do.</p></p><h2>Unstoppable: 45 Powerful Stories of Perseverance and Triumph from People Just Like You</h2><p>Do you crave more out of life, but are unsure about how to get it?

People's dreams have come true, communities have united and individuals have been inspired to try one more time.<br><br>From the greatest global achievement to the most personal accomplishment in our daily lives, the unstoppable spirit is the driving force for positive change and growth. This spirit is the force that breaks through countless personal barriers--barriers of self-doubt, negativity, and our own perceived limitations. It compels us to persist in striving toward our goals.<br><br>But how does one develop an unstoppable spirit? Is it only for those with superhuman abilities? Must one be born with a special gift? This book was born out of my own search for the answers to those questions. After reviewing and thoroughly researching the stories of hundreds of candidates for Unstoppable, I found the answer to be a resounding No. These individuals are not "superheroes." Most of them are just like you and me, experiencing their share of disappointments and frustrations. However, even in those moments, these people exhibit a few distinguishing characteristics that separate them from all others. These characteristics enable them to keep going when others would throw in the towel.<br><br>Seven Characteristics of Unstoppable People<br>Seven characteristics surfaced over and over. Unstoppable people:<br>1. Devote themselves to their true purpose<br>2. Follow their heart's passion<br>3. Believe in themselves and their ideas<br>4. Prepare for challenges<br>5. Ask for help and build a support team<br>6. Seek creative solutions<br>7. Persevere, no matter what the challenges<br>Fortunately, anyone who has the will to do so can develop these characteristics. To assist you in that process, this book devotes an entire chapter to each trait. The chapters are clearly illustrated with short profiles of people who have exhibited that characteristic. Most of the people in this book possess more than one of these attributes; however, I have placed each story in the chapter where it best demonstrates a specific characteristic.<br><br>In addition to the profiles of unstoppable individuals, each chapter includes a special feature called "In Their Own Words," an assortment of quotes, little-known facts, poems, and cartoons that support each chapter's theme. In various formats, you will meet dozens of individuals who transformed their dreams into reality. Each one has a different story to tell, and yet each experienced unstoppable results....<br><br>Creating the Unstoppable You!<br>At the end of each chapter, you will find "Your Personal Action Plan" with exercises and a step-by-step guide that will enable you to further develop each characteristic in your own life.<br><br>Maybe your goal is not to end world hunger, run a multibillion-dollar company, or make the cover of Time. Maybe your aspirations and desires focus on starting a new business, making a career change or doing volunteer work in your community. Perhaps you've been wanting to run for a school board position, complete a 5K race or pursue the passion for music that you abandoned for more practical pursuits. The size of the goal is not what constitutes an unstoppable spirit. It is personified in anyone who identifies a goal--something that really matters to that person--and refuses to give up until that goal is achieved. <br></p><h2>The Power of Sympathy and the Coquette (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Written in epistolary form and drawn from actual events, Brown&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Power of Sympathy</i>&nbsp;(1789) and Foster&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Coquette</i>&nbsp;(1797) were two of the earliest novels published in the United States. Both novels reflect the eighteenth-century preoccupation with the role of women as safekeepers of the young country&#x2019;s morality.</p><p>Written in epistolary form and drawn from actual events, The Power of Sympathy (1789) and The Coquette (1797) were two of the earliest novels published in America. William Hill Brown&#39;s The Power of Sympathy reflects eighteenth-century America&#39;s preoccupation with the role of women as safekeepers of the country&#39;s morality. A novel about the dangers of succumbing to sexual temptations and the rewards of resistance, it was meant to promote women&#39;s moral rectitude, and the letters through which the story is told are filled with advice on the proper relationships between the sexes. Like The Power of Sympathy, Hannah Webster Foster&#39;s The Coquette is concerned with womanly virtue. Eliza Wharton is eager to enjoy a bit of freedom before settling down to domestic life and begins a flirtation with the handsome, rakish Sanford. Their letters trace their relationship from its romantic beginnings to the transgression that inevitably brings their exclusion from proper society. In her Introduction, Carla Mulford discusses the novels&#39; importance in the development of American literature and as vivid reflections of the goal to establish a secure republic built on the virtue of its citizens.William Wells Brown (1814&#x2013;1884) was born a slave, escaped to the North and then to England, and became one of the most prominent abolitionists of his time.

Accompanied only by his dying dog and his memories, the irascible warhorse (a stand-in for the "real" Abbey) begins a bizarre cross-country odyssey--determined to make peace with his past--and to wage one last war against the ravages of "progress."</p><p>"A profane, wildly funny, brash, overbearing, exquisite tour de force." -- <i>The Chicago Tribune</i></p></p><p>Just before he died in 1989, Ed Abbey published what he called his "honest novel," one loosely based on his own life. Early in its opening pages, Abbey's alter ego, Lightcap, takes off from his nearly empty home (its contents just removed by a disgruntled spouse) in Tucson, Arizona--but not before shooting his refrigerator, a hated symbol of civilization. Lightcap makes a winding journey by car to his boyhood home in the Appalachian Mountains of Pennsylvania, calling on old friends along the road, visiting Indian reservations and out-of-the-way bars, and reminiscing about the triumphs and follies of his life. Readers would be mistaken to view this as pure autobiography, but <i>The Fool's Progress</i> nonetheless is an illuminating look into Abbey's time and his way of thinking, especially on matters of ecology and other social issues. It's also a picaresque tale humorously and artfully told, a book that Abbey himself rightly regarded as one of his best works of fiction. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><p>The author of<i> Desert Solitaire</i> and <i>The Monkey Wrench Gang</i> is unchallenged among radicals of all ages. <b>Edward Abbey</b>, an American icon, called "the original fly in the ointment" by Tom McGuane, today has roads and a town named after him.</p></p><h2>Burnham&#39;s Celestial Handbook: An Observer&#39;s Guide to the Universe Beyond the Solar System, Vol. 2</h2><p>Chamaeleon Through OrionWhile there are many books on stars, there is only one <i>Celestial Handbook</i>. Now completely revised through 1977, this unique and necessary reference is available once again to guide amateur and advanced astronomers in their knowledge and enjoyment of the stars. <br>After an extensive introduction in Volume I, which gives the beginner enough information to follow about 80 percent of the body of the material, the author gives comprehensive coverage to the thousands of celestial objects outside our solar system that are within the range of telescopes in the two- to twelve-inch range. <br>The objects are grouped according to the constellations in which they appear. Each constellation is divided into four subject sections: list of double and multiple stars; list of variable stars; list of star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies; and descriptive notes. For each object the author gives names, celestial coordinates, classification, and full physical description. These, together with a star atlas, will help you find and identify almost every object of interest. <br>But the joy of the book is the descriptive notes that follow. They cover history, unusual movements or appearances, and currently accepted explanations of such visible phenomena as white dwarfs, novae and supernovae, cepheids, mira-type variables, dark nebulae, gaseous nebulae, eclipsing binary stars, the large Magellanic cloud, the evolution of a star cluster, and hundreds of other topics, many of which are difficult to find in one place. Hundreds of charts and other visual aids are included to help in identification. Over 300 photographs capture the objects and, in themselves, are works of beauty that reflect the enthusiasm that star gazers have for their subject.</p><p>Robert Burnham works at "Astronomy" magazine and is a member of the American Astronomical Society and the American Geophysical Union.

H. Stahl<br>"Indeed, seeing that so much of Greek is mathematics, it is arguable that, if one would understand the Greek genius fully, it would be a good plan to begin with their geometry." <br>The perspective that enabled Sir Thomas Heath to understand the Greek genius &#x2014; deep intimacy with languages, literatures, philosophy, and all the sciences &#x2014; brought him perhaps closer to his beloved subjects and to their own ideal of educated men, than is common or even possible today. Heath read the original texts with a critical, scrupulous eye, and brought to this definitive two-volume history the insights of a mathematician communicated with the clarity of classically taught English. <br>"Of all the manifestations of the Greek genius none is more impressive and even awe-inspiring than that which is revealed by the history of Greek mathematics." Heath records that history&nbsp;with the scholarly comprehension and comprehensiveness that marks this work as obviously classic now as when it first appeared in 1921. The linkage and unity of mathematics and philosophy suggest the outline for the entire history. Heath covers in sequence Greek numerical notation, Pythagorean arithmetic, Thales and Pythagorean geometry, Zeno, Plato, Euclid, Aristarchus, Archimedes, Apollonius, Hipparchus and trigonometry, Ptolemy, Heron, Pappus, Diophantus of Alexandria and the algebra. Interspersed are sections devoted to the history and analysis of famous problems: squaring the circle, angle trisection, duplication of the cube, and an appendix on Archimedes' proof of the subtangent property of a spiral. The coverage is everywhere thorough and judicious;&nbsp;but Heath is not content with plain exposition: <br>It is a defect in the existing histories that, while they state generally the contents of, and the main propositions proved in, the great treatises of Archimedes and Apollonius, they make little attempt to describe the procedure by which the results are obtained. I have therefore taken pains, in the most significant cases, to show the course of the argument in sufficient detail to enable&nbsp;a competent mathematician to grasp the method used and to apply it, if he will, to other similar investigations.&nbsp;<br>Mathematicians, then, will rejoice to find Heath back in print and accessible after many years. Historians of Greek culture and science can renew acquaintance with a standard reference; readers in general will find, particularly in the energetic discourses on Euclid and Archimedes, exactly what Heath means by <i>impressive and awe-inspiring</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p></p><p><p><b>Thomas Little Heath: Bringing the Past to Life <br></b>Thomas Little Heath (1861&#x2013;1940) was unusual for an authority on many esoteric, and many less esoteric, subjects in the history of mathematics in that he was never a university professor. The son of an English farmer from Lincolnshire, Heath demonstrated his academic gifts at a young age; studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1879 to 1882; came away with numerous awards; and obtained the top grade in the 1884 English Civil Service examination. From that foundation, he went to work in the English Treasury, rose through the ranks, and by 1913, was permanent secretary to the Treasury, effectively the head of its operations. He left that post in 1919 at the end of the first World War, worked several years at the National Debt office, and retired in 1926. <br>During all of that time, however, he became independently one of the world's leading authorities on the history of mathematics, especially on the history of ancient Greek mathematics. Heath's three-volume edition of <i>Euclid</i> is still the standard, it is generally accepted that it is primarily through Heath's great work on Archimedes that the accomplishments of Archimedes are known as well as they are. <br>Dover has reprinted these and other books by Heath, preserving over several decades a unique legacy in the history of mathematical scholarship. </p><p><b></b></p><p><b>In the Author's Own Words:<br></b>"The works of Archimedes are without exception, monuments of mathematical exposition; the gradual revelation of the plan of attack, the masterly ordering of the propositions, the stern elimination of everything not immediately relevant to the purpose, the finish of the whole, are so impressive in their perfection as to create a feeling akin to awe in the mind of the reader." &#x2014; Thomas L. Heath </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Euripides: Medea (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics) (Greek and English Edition)</h2><p>This edition presents Medea, the most famous play of the Athenian tragedian Euripides, in ancient Greek, with commentary designed for university Greek classes, from second-year Greek upward.

Changes in this edition reflect important developments in nursing, ethical theory, and nursing ethics. Among the expanded set of 64 cases, 22 have been significantly revised and 15 are entirely new. Reasoning skills and philosophical understanding are explained and illustrated in cases involving: nurses and clients; inter-professional relationships; personal responsibility for institutional and public policy; and cost containment, justice, and rationing. New material on ethical theory includes an illustrated explanation and defense of moral pluralism, a section on the ethics of care, and an expanded discussion of reflective equilibrium as a method of ethical reasoning. New topics include pandemics and care for SARS patients, elderly patients contemplating suicide, and workplace violence. As with previous editions, both the nursing and philosophical content are self-contained, making the book accessible to readers with little or no background in either. <em>Ethics in Nursing</em> provides practicing and student nurses with a useful introduction to the identification and analysis of ethical issues that reflects both the special perspective of nursing and the value of systematic philosophical inquiry.<br></p><p><br>Martin Benjamin is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy, Michigan State University <br>Joy Curtis is Emerita Professor of Nursing and Emerita University Ombudsman, Michigan State University<br><br>"This is a comprehensive and practical ethics guide for nurses based on a clearly explained philosophical foundation.

It is quickly evident that this is still the case in this latest edition.... I heartily recommend this book to nursing students in the first instance, and also to any nurse who wants to deepen a basic understanding of ethics." --<em>Nursing Ethics</em><p></p><br>"<em>Ethics in Nursing</em> is well organized, with chapters containing enough case studies and discussion to engage the reader. Readers are stimulated to think about their own personal ethical challenges, reexamine old ways of thinking, and formulate new perspectives of practice. Overall, this book is an excellent review of ethical dilemmas encountered across the continuum of care by nurses at all levels of practice and fulfills its purpose. The authors are well-respected scholars in their fields, and the information presented is accurate, timely, and current. This book is ideal for use as required reading in any course that addresses care across the age continuum, disease-specific disorders, the role of the nurse, or issues facing nursing, including leadership and delegation." --<em>JAMA</em> <br><p></p><br>"Overall, this book is an excellent review of ethical dilemmas encountered across the continuum of care by nurses at all levels of practice and fulfills its purpose.

Now Robinson returns to the realm he has made his own&#x2014;the planet Mars&#x2014;in a brilliantly imagined drama with a searing poetic vision.</b><br><br>From a training mission in Antarctica to blistering sandstorms sweeping through labyrinths of barren canyons, the interwoven stories of <i>The Martians</i>&nbsp;set in motion a sprawling cast of characters upon the surface of Mars. As the planet is transformed from an unexplored and forbidding terrain to a troubled image of a re-created Earth, we meet the First Hundred explorers&#x2014;men and women who are bound together by Earth&#x2019;s tenuous toehold on Mars. Presenting unforgettable stories of hope and disappointment, of fierce physical and psychological struggles, <i>The Martians</i>&nbsp;is an epic chronicle of a planet that represents one of humanity&#x2019;s most glorious possibilities.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Martians</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A uniquely rewarding experience of state-of-the-art science fiction.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b><i><b>The New York Times Book Review</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;No one familiar with Robinson&#x2019;s trilogy can read through these final, valedictory stories without feeling moved.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b><i><b>The Washington Post</b><br></i><br>&#x201c;The stories are beautifully written, the characters are well developed and the author&#x2019;s passion for ecology manifests itself on every page.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly </i>(starred review)</b></p><p><i>The Martians</i> is a collection of stories, alternate histories, poems, and even the complete text of a planetary constitution based on Kim Stanley Robinson's award-winning Mars trilogy (composed of <i>Red Mars</i>, <i>Green Mars</i>, and <i>Blue Mars</i>). For those unfamiliar with the series, The Martians from the title are the humans who have colonized and terraformed the Red Planet over the course of several generations. While Robinson told their story at considerable length in his novels, <i>The Martians</i> fleshes out some of his more interesting characters and also adds depth to their world.<p> When it's at its best, this collection presents stand-alone stories of life, love, and work on our celestial neighbor, ranging from the tale of an expedition seeking to conquer Olympus Mons in "Green Mars" to a folksy story of friendship and baseball in "Arthur Sternbach Brings the Curveball to Mars." Unfortunately, some of the material here can be tough going for those unfamiliar with Robinson's Mars milieu. For instance, the ending piece, "Purple Mars," is apparently an autobiographical snippet about the day Robinson finished writing the final novel. That's great stuff for someone who has been following the entire Mars saga from beginning to end, but newcomers will probably not know what to make of it.</p><p> Still, there is enough material here to interest anyone on the lookout for some good Mars stories. Although Robinson has made his name by writing fat novels that span dozens of generations and characters, in <i>The Martians</i> he proves that he is also adept at shorter pieces. It's a fine if somewhat uneven collection that serves to round out the Mars universe while providing some excellent reading. <i>--Craig E.

Every single man, woman and child is a partner in the most tremendous undertaking of our American history. We must share together the bad news, the good news, the defeats, the victories, the changing fortunes of war.</i><br><br> -- President Franklin D. Roosevelt<br><br>A cold January rain drizzled onto the rolling red-dust hills of central Oklahoma the day Ruben Rivers walked to war. He had to walk to Tecumseh to catch the bus that would take him to join the army, because no vehicle could get down the road when it rained, not unless it was pulled by mules or horses. He seemed reluctant to take each step. He stopped and looked back down the muddy road that led past the ramshackle farmhouse behind the rusty barbed wire.<br><br>There were those in the little Negro community of Holtuka who insisted this was a white man's war and that Negroes didn't belong in it. The only reason Negroes were invited was so they could cook for the white man and clean up after him while he did the fighting. Ruben didn't see it that way. This was <i>his</i> country, too. Hadn't the Japs attacked Pearl Harbor? Ruben and the two other older boys in the large Rivers family, Robert and Dewey, had talked of little else but the war since the sneak attack five weeks ago. Ruben was the first of them to make up his mind to go.<br><br>He stood in the churned mud of the road looking back at the house. A gawky farm kid in faded overalls, brogans, and a raggedy old winter coat, seemingly stuck in a stage of growth that was neither boy nor fully man. Rainwater beaded on a smooth honey-brown face that showed traces, perhaps, of both slaves and slave owners. The jaw was strong and well defined, the eyes dark and so straight-staring they averted under no man's gaze. A lean young man going to war like millions of others from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C.<br><br>Little sister Anese stood alone on the front porch waving through the drizzle. A brown little girl wearing a faded feed-sack dress Mama had sewn for her. Tears and rain in her eyes. Waving and waving. The others were out at the barn tending livestock or still inside because they couldn't stand the further heartbreak of actually watching Ruben leave home.<br><br>Ruben waved a last time at his baby sister. He then turned abruptly, batted his eyes, lowered his head into the cold rain, and resolutely trudged in the direction of Tecumseh. He would have to walk the whole distance. He never looked back again. He remembered hearing somewhere that the road away from home led in only one direction. Once you left home you could never go back again.<br><br>E. G. McConnell was sixteen years old when Moms went with him to the recruiting station in New York and lied about his age so he could enlist in the army. Moms went talking back to the recruiting sergeant, wagging her finger in his face and scolding, "Take care of my boy now, ya hear?"<br><br>"Yes, ma'am, we sure will do that."<br><br>The skinny kid with the wide boyish grin ducked his head in embarrassment. His brown face flushed even darker when Moms grabbed him and hugged him to her ample bosom, cried some more, and made sure he had his prayer book. Then she left him with the recruiter, her admonishment to "Take care of my boy" still hanging in the air.<br><br>E.G. was one green recruit, his first time away from home. Like most draftees or volunteers, he had little knowledge or understanding of the political and military machines that formed the war's "Big Picture." His only concern was with the narrow picture that affected him personally.<br><br>He traveled by rail from Camp Upton, New York, to Fort Knox, Kentucky, where he would attend basic training in the armored specialty. He understood that to mean tanks; Negroes had never been allowed to drive tanks before because they were not supposed to be smart enough.<br><br>The troop train swayed and rattled on its narrow steel tracks. It was stifling hot inside at times, what with all the black soldier recruits crammed into the cars talking and laughing and shouting and playing cards. Everyone seemed in high spirits, off to some great adventure. Soot and ashes from the steam engine blew in through the open windows. Sometimes a live ember sent men stomping and shouting and hooting with laughter as they frantically brushed it off their clothing and chased it down before it caused further chaos.<br><br>E.G. became acquainted with a tall, dark, sour man from Detroit.<br><br>"Man, you see how they put all us niggers in cars right behind the engine?" he asked.<br><br>"What you saying?" E.G. wanted to know, puzzled.<br><br>"The white boys' cars is back at the end of the train where they don't get ashes and stuff from the engine." He laughed bitterly. "The only time we ever go to the front of the line is when the white boys don't <i>want</i> to be there. It's gonna be the same thing when we go to the war. We only going to the front line when they don't want to be there."<br><br>E.G. had never realized before that there was so much country to the United States and that so much of it was mountains and forests. The heavily loaded train slowed as it climbed the northern Kentucky hills on its last leg to Fort Knox. Sergeants came through the cars.<br><br>"Pull down all the window shades," they ordered.<br><br>"What fo'?" the dark dude from Detroit asked.<br><br>"Do as you're told."<br><br>It got dank and silent in the cars. Was the train being attacked or what? Curious but not about to defy orders and mess with the shades, E.G. stepped out onto the platform between cars to see what was going on. The train had reduced speed as it always did to pass through one of those little rural towns that dotted the countryside. E.G. saw a paved main street lined by mom-and-pop stores, a few parked Ford pickups, some mule teams and wagons in the back alley. Nothing unusual.<br><br>Then, with a start, he realized the purpose for pulling the shades. White men and grown boys lined the track, standing almost shoulder to shoulder, each one armed with a squirrel rifle or shotgun. They glared at the train as it clack-clacked through town, as though daring it to stop or to lift a shade to reveal a black face. Rumors went around that several previous troop trains carrying Negroes had been fired upon.<br><br>The dude from Detroit laughed. "Yeah, and here we goes to fight fo' these crackers and the whole United States."<br><br>Fresh out of tanker training at Fort Knox, Eddie Donald was not overly surprised to find "white" and "colored" drinking fountains and latrines when he arrived at Camp Claiborne southwest of Alexandria, Louisiana. This was the Deep South. Claiborne was totally segregated. After all, it hadn't really been that long ago that slavery ended. Less than eighty years ago. There were still black folks living who had been born in slavery, others who had labored as kids in the massa's cotton fields.<br><br>White soldiers were quartered in newly painted white barracks on good ground near Headquarters, the sports arena, and the large Service Club near the front of the camp. Black soldiers were in the lowlands next to the swamp at the back of the camp. They weren't allowed in the white areas, except to walk on through. That was fair enough, Donald thought wryly. After all, white soldiers weren't allowed in the black swamp either.<br><br>The tall, lanky black man shook his head, shouldered the barracks bag that contained his issued and personal items, and walked straightaway along the streets until black faces replaced white faces. The appearance of the camp changed drastically. Tents and one-story barracks lined the road, many of them old and sorely in need of repair and painting. They were miserable-looking quarters in comparison to those inhabited by white soldiers. Twelve bunks were lined up in each bay, enough for a squad. There was a coal-heating stove at each end. In the summer the windows were screened and mosquito nets installed.<br><br>Donald dropped his bag at his feet and looked up and down the road. Some Negroes were sitting on a barracks stoop talking trash and horsing around with guys on the stoops opposite them. Somewhere in the distance troops were being marched to the rhythm of a Jody call.<br><br>"You a new meat for the 758th Tank Battalion?" someone called out.<br><br>"I am that."<br><br>"Welcome home, boy. Let me show you where you bunking."<br><br>Donald sighed, slapped at a mosquito buzzing around his ears, and picked up his bag.<br><br>Corporal Leonard "Chico" Holland from Detroit drove freshly arrived Lieutenant David J. Williams from Camp Claiborne headquarters to the Negro section of the camp that quartered the all-black 758th. Lieutenant Williams, like all commanders from company level up, was a white man. About six feet tall, athletic-looking, early twenties, short, dark, wavy hair and even darker eyes. He sat on the passenger's side of the open quarter-ton Jeep, eagerly looking forward to his first command assignment.<br><br>Chico drove past the nice neat white barracks and officers' quarters on the hill, past the busy PX and the sports complex.<br><br>"Where are we going?" the lieutenant asked his driver, looking around and frowning.<br><br>"Lieutenant, you'll see," Chico said mysteriously, a half-grin on his face.<br><br>The Jeep slowed where the crest of the hill sloped off into lowlands that had once been a swamp. Williams stared, not immediately comprehending. Weather-beaten tents and raw one-story barracks presented a lithograph of a Civil War bivouac area. He had expected more.<br><br>"Officers are in the tents at the top of the row," Chico said. He seemed amused at the stunned expression on the green young officer's face.<br><br>The next morning, Lieutenant Williams went back up the hill to report in to the white commander of the 758th Tank Battalion. He saluted crisply. Captain Barnes looked him over with a disapproving eye and told him to sit down on the hard chair in front of his desk. From a folder he extracted a newspaper clipping from the front page of the <i>Pittsburgh Courier.</i> He shoved it across the desk. Williams recognized his own photo in uniform above the headline "Pittsburgh Industrialist's Son and Politician Goes with Race Troops."<br><br>"It looks like your daddy has money and influence," Barnes said with a dismissive flip of the hand. "Is that why you're here? Your old man put you in a safe place away from the war?"<br><br>"Sir, if you've looked at my file you'll see I was drafted as a private in January 1941, then attended Officers Candidate School after Pearl Harbor. I volunteered to come here. It had nothing to do with my father or his money."<br><br>"Humpf," Captain Barnes said, as though he didn't believe it. "Be that as it may, you've ended up in a safe place to ride out the war. These negras aren't ever going to fight. We're just marking time down here in these swamps until the war is over."<br><br>Lieutenant Williams didn't know what to say. He sat with his hands clasped between his knees.<br><br>"You're down here with Eleanor Roosevelt's niggers, Lieutenant," Captain Barnes continued. "These people are different and you've got to handle them different. You're from up east and you don't understand that yet. Boy, I'm going to teach you about negras."<br><br>Williams stared mutely at his commander, who seemed to expect some sort of reply. A light knock on the door saved him. A handsome black sergeant entered on Barnes's permission. Williams stood up.<br><br>"Turley," Barnes said to the sergeant, "I want you to meet our new second lieutenant from up east. From that uppity college, Yale University. Lieutenant Williams, Turley is one of our company first sergeants."<br><br>Williams shook hands. Immediately, Barnes sprang to his feet, his face reddening as if he were about to have a stroke. A thick finger jabbed toward the door.<br><br>"Turley, get out of here."<br><br>As soon as the first sergeant was gone, Barnes leaned heavily across the top of his desk, his voice low and menacing.<br><br>"Boy, don't ever do that again."<br><br>"Sir?"<br><br>"Shake hands with no negra. Don't ever put yourself on the same level with a nigger."<br><br>The venom in Barnes's voice stunned Williams. "Sir, with all due respect, first sergeants run the army. They deserve respect."<br><br>"You don't know nothing, Lieutenant. You've been up in that uppity college and the only negras you see up there are sheltered. Dismissed, Lieutenant. Get out of here."<br><br>Two weeks later, Captain Barnes summoned Williams to his office.<br><br>"We're getting a new negra tank battalion, the 761st," he said. "I'm getting rid of you. You have done ruined my best first sergeant."<br><br>On April Fool's Day 1942, the all-Negro 761st Tank Battalion was activated at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. Captain Williams and First Sergeant Sam Turley were both kicked out of the 758th and reassigned to the 761st. Charlie Company's commanding officer, Captain Charles Wingo, took the boot lieutenant aside. Wingo was a soft-looking officer with a pale face.<br><br>"You are going to learn, Lieutenant," he said, "that you have got to have a mean coon to keep these boys in line."<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Charles W.

He died in 1977. Albert Uderzo was born in 1927 in a small village in Marne, France. He met Rene Goscinny in 1951 and on 29 October 1959 their most famous creation, Asterix, made his first appearance on page 20 of Pilote. ASTERIX THE GAUL, their first album, was published in 1961 and there have now been 35 Asterix albums.A cartoon drawn with such supreme artistry, and a text layered with such glorious wordplay, satire and historical and political allusion that no reader should ever feel like they've outgrown it.&#x2015;<b>TIME OUT</b><br><br>The Asterix books represent the very summit of our achievement as a literary race. In Asterix one finds all of human life. The fact that the books were written originally in French is no matter. I have read them all in many languages and, like all great literature, they are best in English. Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge, Asterix's translators since the very beginning, have made great books into eternal flames.&#x2015;<b>THE TIMES</b></p><h2>The Prince of Beverly Hills (Rick Barron Novel)</h2><p><b>Brash detective Rick Barron enters the infamous Hollywood fast lane&nbsp;in this thriller from the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Stone Barrington series.</b><br> &nbsp;<br><i>Los Angeles, 1939</i>.

He was not happy to be sitting in a patrol car at the corner of Sunset and Camden at two A.M. on a summer evening in 1939; he was not happy to be wearing a badge with the rank designation of Police Officer, instead of the detective&#x2019;s badge he had worn until the day before; and he was not happy to be in a uniform, instead of a suit. The stiff, new cloth itched.</p><p>He looked to his right, toward Ciro&#x2019;s and the Mocambo and the rest of the clubs on the Strip. At this hour, Sunset was devoid of traffic, except for one set of large headlights rushing toward him at a high rate of speed. Rick started the patrol car. This might be fun, he thought.</p><p>Then he saw the other car. It was a Model A Ford coupe, and it was across the boulevard, coming toward him down Camden, about to stop at Sunset. Only it didn&#x2019;t stop. The little car drove right through the stop sign, moving slowly, toward the safety of Camden on the other side of Sunset. Rick&#x2019;s mouth dropped open; this couldn&#x2019;t be happening. He looked at the oncoming speeder and had just enough time to identify it as a Mercedes-Benz SSK, top down, before it struck the little coupe broadside. The powerful sports car had been doing at least sixty, Rick thought, and it had never even braked.</p><p>The coupe collapsed as if it had been made of tinfoil, absorbing nearly the entire force of the crash, then spun toward the side of the road and came to rest, hard, against a telephone pole. The Mercedes was not stopped, only deflected. It skidded sideways toward the opposite side of the street, struck the curb and rolled over, flinging its driver into a high oleander hedge before coming to rest in an upright position. Rick picked up the microphone.</p><p>&#x201c;This is car 102. I&#x2019;ve got a serious car accident at Sunset and Camden. Request an ambulance and another patrol car immediately.&#x201d;</p><p>The radio crackled. &#x201c;Roger, 102, they&#x2019;re on their way.&#x201d;</p><p>Rick switched on the flashing light on top of his Chevrolet patrol car, drove across Sunset and stopped at the curb, next to what was left of the coupe. The street was still perfectly clear, with a wreck on each side. He jumped out of the car and started for the coupe.</p><p>Sheets of paper littered Sunset, and Rick picked up one. There was a picture of Paul Whiteman on the front: sheet music. He dropped it as he reached the coupe and looked inside. The car was a third of its former width, and the woman inside was barely distinguishable from a pile of cubed beef on a butcher&#x2019;s counter. Rick had never seen such gore. He reached into the car and picked up her left wrist, feeling for a pulse, but felt none. Nothing more to be done here.</p><p>The road was still empty of traffic. He ran across Sunset to the hedge and found the other driver lying facedown in the hedge. Rick turned over the unconscious man and saw that he was wearing a tuxedo. And he wasn&#x2019;t unconscious. The man coughed and sat up, leaning on his elbows. &#x201c;Jesus H. Christ,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;What the fuck happened?&#x201d; He had the makings of a fine shiner around his left eye.</p><p>Rick got a snootful of alcohol fumes. &#x201c;You hit another car,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Are you hurt?&#x201d;</p><p>The man shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; he said. He was handsome, tanned, with thick blond hair and a well-trimmed mustache. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to get me out of here,&#x201d; he said, grimacing. His beautifully even teeth gleamed under the streetlamp. His accent was British.</p><p>Then Rick recognized him. Sirens could be heard in the distance, and his mind worked at a furious pace, weighing options, considering gain against punishment. He decided. &#x201c;Can you stand up?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I guess so,&#x201d; the man replied.</p><p>Rick helped him to his feet, took hold of a wrist and slung the man&#x2019;s arm around his neck. Rick was six-two, and the man was as tall. &#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Rick said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ve got to move fast.&#x201d; He scurried across Sunset, half walking, half dragging, and got the man into the rear seat of the patrol car. &#x201c;Lie down there, so nobody can see you,&#x201d; he commanded. He was about to get behind the wheel, when he had another thought. He ran back across Sunset to the wreck of the Mercedes, found his pocketknife and quickly unscrewed the license plates. Then he went to the driver&#x2019;s side, groped around the steering column and ripped off the registration certificate that had been secured there. As he stuffed it into his pocket, another patrol car arrived, siren dying.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got one of &#x2019;em in my car,&#x201d; he said to the driver. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t seem to be hurt too bad. I&#x2019;ll take him to the hospital. You wait for the ambulance. The other one is hamburger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; the other cop replied.</p><p>Rick ran for his car and got behind the wheel. &#x201c;Where can I take you?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Find a phone,&#x201d; the man replied from the depths of the rear seat.</p><p>Rick started the car, made a U-turn and swung down Camden, driving fast. After two blocks, he saw a pay phone on a corner. &#x201c;Who do you want me to call?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>A hand came up from the backseat with a small, black address book. &#x201c;Call Eddie Harris,&#x201d; his passenger said. &#x201c;Tell him what&#x2019;s happened. He&#x2019;ll know what to do.&#x201d;</p><p>Rick ran to the phone booth and closed himself inside it. The light came on, and he riffled through the book, looking for the number. The names there were a roster of Hollywood celebrities, most of them women; Lana Turner and Hedy Lamarr were there. He found a home number for Harris, dropped a nickel into the phone and dialed. Harris was something at Centurion Studios; Rick wasn&#x2019;t sure just what.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; an angry, sleepy voice barked into the phone.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Harris, my name is Barron. I&#x2019;m a Beverly Hills Police officer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; Harris replied. His voice was calm now.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got Clete Barrow in my patrol car. He&#x2019;s been in a bad accident; a woman is dead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How badly is Barrow hurt?&#x201d; Harris demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;He seems to be okay. He should be checked out at a hospital, though.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Take him to Centurion, to his bungalow. I&#x2019;ll meet you there. What was your name again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Barron.&#x201d; Rick spelled it for him.</p><p>&#x201c;Hurry up,&#x201d; Harris said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yessir.&#x201d; Rick hung up and ran for the car.</p><p>IT TOOK HIM LESS THAN ten minutes to reach the film studio, no flashing light, no siren. He slid to a stop at the gate. A guard, apparently warned he was coming, waved him on.</p><p>&#x201c;First left, second right,&#x201d; the man in the backseat said. &#x201c;Number 104.&#x201d;</p><p>Rick followed the directions.</p><p>&#x201c;Right here,&#x201d; Barrow said from the rear seat. He was sitting up now.</p><p>Rick parked the car, slid across the seat, opened the rear door and helped his passenger out. He looked around. He was on what looked like a street of bungalows. He steered Barrow up the front walk of a pretty cottage with window boxes and a swing on the front porch. Barrow fumbled with a key and let them into the house.</p><p>Rick found himself in a beautifully decorated living room, furnished with every comfort. Barrow opened a door and switched on some lights in an adjoining room. Rick blinked in the glare. Barrow sat down at a wide dressing table with a big mirror surrounded by little lightbulbs. He looked carefully at his face in the mirror. &#x201c;No real damage,&#x201d; he said, with some satisfaction. He felt his body. &#x201c;Maybe some bruised ribs, and they&#x2019;ll have to shoot my right side only, but I can work.&#x201d; He got up and went back into the living room, to a bar. &#x201c;You want a drink?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No, and you&#x2019;re not going to have one either,&#x201d; Rick said, removing a decanter of scotch from the actor&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to need to be as sober as possible.&#x201d;</p><p>The door opened and a sturdy-looking, balding man in his forties walked into the room. &#x201c;Clete,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, Eddie,&#x201d; Barrow replied. &#x201c;Thanks for coming.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s some shiner. We&#x2019;re going to have to shoot around it tomorrow. The doctor will be here in a minute. I want you checked out thoroughly. Get out of that tux and into a robe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, Eddie. You want a drink? The cop won&#x2019;t let me have one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Harris replied. He turned to Rick and stuck out his hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Eddie Harris,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Mr. Harris.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Call me Eddie; everybody does. What&#x2019;s your first name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rick.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Frederick?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Richard, but nobody has ever called me that, except my mother, when she was angry with me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rick, is Barrow under arrest?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not unless you want him to be,&#x201d; Rick replied.</p><p>&#x201c;Good man. Come and sit down for a minute, and let&#x2019;s talk.&#x201d;</p><p>Rick followed Harris to a pair of leather armchairs before a fireplace and sat down in one, removing his uniform cap.</p><p>&#x201c;That uniform looks brand-new,&#x201d; Harris said, &#x201c;but you don&#x2019;t look like a rookie.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not. It&#x2019;s just my first day back in uniform. I seem to have put on a little weight since the last time I wore one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d you get busted? What was the beef?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was seeing a young lady who turned out to be my commanding officer&#x2019;s niece,&#x201d; Rick said. &#x201c;The captain and I didn&#x2019;t see eye to eye about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet,&#x201d; Harris said. &#x201c;Is she pregnant?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What was your job before?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Detective, assigned to Homicide and Robbery.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a plum assignment, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re a patrolman. It&#x2019;s a long way to fall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re telling me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds like you don&#x2019;t have much of a future with the Beverly Hills Police Department.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s say Chief Blair doesn&#x2019;t have to worry about his job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen you somewhere before, but I can&#x2019;t place you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I get around, I guess. Probably a restaurant or a club.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it: at the bar at Ciro&#x2019;s, more than once.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been there more than once.&#x201d;</p><p>Harris nodded. &#x201c;Tell me what happened tonight. I want it straight&#x2014;everything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was sitting in my patrol car at Sunset and Camden. Barrow came from the direction of the Strip, doing at least sixty. He struck a Model A coupe that ran a stop sign. The woman driver was killed instantly. Barrow&#x2019;s car rolled, and he was thrown into a hedge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What did you do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I called for an ambulance and a patrol car to deal with traffic, checked the woman, then checked on Barrow. When I recognized him, I got him out of there. The car&#x2019;s license plates are on the bar.&#x201d; He reached into his pocket. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the registration.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good man. Let me give you a little lesson in Hollywood damage control: The woman drove right out in front of Barrow, so she was at fault. He was driving the speed limit; he didn&#x2019;t smell of liquor; he asked to be brought here, instead of a hospital. Got that?&#x201d;</p><p>Rick nodded. &#x201c;If you can, you ought to send a tow truck over to Sunset and Camden to get Barrow&#x2019;s car out of there. You don&#x2019;t want those two cars compared in newspaper photographs. The coupe got much of the worst of it.&#x201d;</p><p>Harris picked up a phone next to his chair, dialed a number, barked some orders and hung up. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be out of there in half an hour.&#x201d;</p><p>Simultaneously, Barrow came out of his dressing room in a robe, and a man came in the front door, carrying a satchel.</p><p>&#x201c;Doc,&#x201d; Harris said, turning toward the man, &#x201c;Mr. Barrow&#x2019;s been in a car accident. I want him checked out thoroughly, and get some ice on that eye, will you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; the doctor said. &#x201c;Mr. Barrow, let&#x2019;s go in the other room.&#x201d; He turned back to Harris. &#x201c;You want a blood sample taken?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Harris said, turning to Rick. &#x201c;You been drinking at all tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Roll up your sleeve.&#x201d;</p><p>Rick did as he was told, and the doctor removed a syringe from his bag, swabbed the arm with alcohol and drew some blood.</p><p>Harris stood up and held out a business card to Rick. &#x201c;You may not have much of a future with the police,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but you just might have a future with Centurion. Call me tomorrow morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Rick replied, pocketing the card.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your captain&#x2019;s name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lawrence O&#x2019;Connell.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t speak to him unless you have to. If you have to, stick to the story. I&#x2019;ll call him first thing in the morning.&#x201d;</p><p>RICK WAS BACK AT THE accident site before the ambulance left. A fire engine was present, and two firemen were working on the wrecked coupe with crowbars, while two patrol cars stood by. The Mercedes was nowhere in sight.</p><p>A sergeant got out of a car and walked over. &#x201c;Where the hell have you been?&#x201d; he demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;I took the passenger who was still alive to a doctor,&#x201d; Rick said.</p><p>&#x201c;Is he all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He seems fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Was he drunk?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I observed nothing that would make me think so.&#x201d; He took a glass tube from his pocket and handed it to the sergeant. &#x201c;I witnessed the doctor take a blood sample,&#x201d; he said, but he didn&#x2019;t say whose. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like you to take custody of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; the sergeant said. &#x201c;You said you took him to a doctor. Not a hospital?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t seem badly injured, and he insisted on seeing his own doctor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Was this guy somebody . . . I ought to know about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He was Clete Barrow. A Mr. Eddie Harris at Centurion Studios said he would speak to the captain.&#x201d;</p><p>The sergeant nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell the captain about this. You stay away from him. Write an accident report and have it on my desk before you go off duty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Rick said. &#x201c;Can I go back to the station and do it now? Tomorrow&#x2019;s my day off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go ahead. And I don&#x2019;t want you talking to the press, you understand? If they track you down, refer them to the captain.&#x201d;</p><p>Rick nodded. The sergeant walked away, and Rick looked over at the remains of the Ford coupe. Two firemen had done their work, and now the ambulance men were loading the mangled remains of the woman onto a stretcher. He felt for the woman, but she shouldn&#x2019;t have run that stop sign. His conscience, such as it was, was clear.</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>RICK WAS WAKENED BY THE ringing telephone at nine A.M. He let it ring three times, then picked it up. &#x201c;Barron,&#x201d; he groaned.</p><p>&#x201c;I saw your report,&#x201d; the captain&#x2019;s voice said. &#x201c;Is that the way it happened?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the way I saw it, Captain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It better be correct in all respects.&#x201d;</p><p>Rick didn&#x2019;t reply to that.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is the Mercedes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. It was gone when I got back to the scene. A Mr. Eddie Harris said he&#x2019;d call you.&#x201d;</p><p>The captain hung up without another word.</p><p>&#x201c;Miserable son of a bitch,&#x201d; Rick said aloud. He reached for his cigarettes before he remembered he had quit smoking some weeks before. He swung his feet over the side of the bed and stood up, stretching. He&#x2019;d had only three or four hours of sleep&#x2014;he&#x2019;d have had more, if the captain hadn&#x2019;t called&#x2014;but he felt pretty well. At twenty-nine, he could stand the strain. He showered, then fixed himself some breakfast. He retrieved the LA <i>Times</i> from outside his door and scanned it as he ate. There it was, on page four:</p><p>PIANIST KILLED IN SUNSET BLVD ACCIDENT</p><p>Somebody got it in the paper at the last minute, he figured.

Capitalizing on West&#x2019;s wide array of interests, this collection of his essays touches on topics ranging from viruses and the telegraph to children, bison, and Larry McMurtry. Drawing from the past three centuries, West weaves the western story into that of the nation and the world beyond, from Kansas and Montana to Haiti, Africa, and the court of Louis XV. <br> Divided into three sections, the volume begins with conquest. West is not the first historian to write about Lewis and Clark, but he is the first to contrast their expedition with Mungo Park&#x2019;s contemporaneous journey in Africa. &#x201c;The Lewis and Clark expedition,&#x201d; West begins, &#x201c;is one of the most overrated events in American history&#x2014;and one of the most revealing.&#x201d; The humor of this insightful essay is a chief characteristic of the whole book, which comprises ten chapters previously published in major journals and magazines&#x2014;but revised for this edition&#x2014;and four brand-new ones. <br> West is well known for his writings about frontier family life, especially the experiences of children at work and play. Fans of his earlier books on these subjects will not be disappointed. In a final section, he looks at the West of myth and imagination, in part to show that our fantasies about the West are worth studying precisely because they have been so at odds with the real West. In essays on buffalo, Jesse James and the McMurtry novel <i>Lonesome Dove,</i> West directs his formidable powers to subjects that continue to shape our understanding&#x2014;and often our misunderstanding&#x2014;of the American West, past and present.<br></p><p><b>Elliott West</b>, Alumni Distinguished Professor of History at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, is the award-winning author of numerous articles and books, including <i>Growing Up with the Country: Childhood on the Far-Western Frontier</i>; <i>The Contested Plains: Indians, Goldseekers, and the Rush to Colorado</i>; and <i>The Last Indian War: The Nez Perce Story.</i><br><br><p><b>Richard White,</b> Margaret Byrne Professor of American History at Stanford University, is author of <i>It's Your Misfortune and None of My Own: A New History of the American West </i>and <i>Remembering Ahanagran: Storytelling in a Family's Past.</i></p>&#x201c;Calling this book a collection of essays makes as much sense as calling the Rocky Mountains a collection of rocks.

He states that each time he writes, he finds his understanding of life and love just a little clearer and his expression of that understanding a little more vivid. Dekker&#x2019;s body of work includes Heaven&#x2019;s Wager, When Heaven Weeps, Thunder of Heaven, Blessed Child, A Man Called Blessed, Blink, Thr3e, The Circle Series: Black, Red, White, Green (a prequel), and Obsessed.Adam Verner&#39;s powerful characterization of evil Marsuvees Black is chilling. Verner makes believable Black&#39;s efforts to eliminate religious freedom in the United States. When Billy and Darcy&#39;s unexplained supernatural powers manifest, Verner captures their anxiety and fear with an understated portrayal, and then credibly depicts their inexplicable change in attitude. Verner&#39;s energetic performance of the final stand against evil at Paradise amid three thousand people is also gripping. However, Verner&#39;s excellent narration and characterizations can&#39;t make up for the flaws in Dekker&#39;s story, which is the conclusion of the series. Although similar to the books in the Left Behind series, Sinner is pedantic, predictable, and not at all typical of this author.

In lucid, accessible language, these books explain essential topics such as Wittgenstein's determination to insist on the integrity and the autonomy of nonscientific forms of understanding.<br><br> Though Wittgenstein wrote on the same subjects that dominate the work of other analytic philosophers &#x2015; the nature of logic, the limits of language, the analysis of meaning &#x2015; he did so in a peculiarly poetic style that separates his work sharply from that of his peers and makes the question of how to read him particularly pertinent.<br><br> At the root of Wittgenstein's thought, Monk argues, is a determination to resist the scientism characteristic of our age, a determination to insist on the integrity and the autonomy of non-scientific forms of understanding. The kind of understanding we seek in philosophy, Wittgenstein tried to make clear, is similar to the kind we might seek of a person, a piece of music, or, indeed, of a poem.</p><p><p><strong>Ray Monk</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Southampton. He is the author of <em>Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius</em> and of a two-volume biography of Bertrand Russell.<br></p><p><strong>Simon Critchley</strong> is a best-selling author and the Hans Jonas Professor at the New School for Social Research.

Perhaps the definitive novel of that "Lost Generation," it tells the story of Amory Blaine, a handsome, wealthy Princeton student who halfheartedly involves himself in literary cults, "liberal" student activities, and a series of empty flirtations with young women. When he finally does fall truly in love, however, the young woman rejects him for another.<br>After serving in France during the war, Blaine returns to embark on a career in advertising. Still young, but already cynical and world-weary, he exemplifies the young men and women of the '20s, described by Fitzgerald as "a generation grown up to find all gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken."</p></p><p>Fitzgerald&#39;s first novel, reprinted in the handsome Everyman&#39;s Library series of literary classic, uses numerous formal experiments to tell the story of Amory Blaine, as he grows up during the crazy years following the First World War. It also contains a new introduction by Craig Raine that describes critical and popular reception of the book when it came out in 1920.F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s This Side of Paradise is the opening statement of his literary career. Published originally in 1920, the novel captures the rhythm and feel of the gaudy decade that was to follow in America. This Side of Paradise made Fitzgerald simultaneously famous and infamous: famous for the stylish exuberance of his writing and infamous for the errors--in spelling, fact, grammar, and chronology--that peppered his text. This new edition brings into being an accurate, fully annotated text based on Fitzgerald&#39;s original manuscript.</p><h2>The Silver Gryphon (Mage Wars)</h2><p>A dozen years of peace have passed in the city of White Gryphon - providing well deserved and much needed security for the people who had lost their homes in the magical Cataclysm which killed the Mage Urtho, creator of the gryphons. But the inhabitants of White Gryphon have not forgotten their long struggles, and have trained an elite guard force, the Silver Gryphons, to protect their city, and if necessary, to join with the army of the Black Kings for mutual defense.</p><p>Mercedes Lackey is a full-time writer and has published numerous novels and works of short fiction, including the best-selling <b>Heralds Of Valdemar</b> series. She is also a professional lyricist and a licensed wild bird rehabilitator. She lives in Oklahoma with her husband, artist Larry Dixon, and their flock of parrots.YA?In Book Three of "The Mage Wars" series, readers find the city of White Gryphon at peace. The warriors of the Cataclysm have settled into a comfortable and secure life within the city gates. But, there are other worlds to explore outside the haven of White Gryphon. Silverblade, a human, and Tadrith, a gryphon, complete rigorous training and are sent on their first solo mission to guard a remote outpost, where they encounter dangers and unknown evil. Using the skills learned in training and the tools at hand, Blade and Tad defeat their enemies and win the admiration of their parents. More importantly they learn to trust in themselves and one another when threatened. Even without having read The Black Gryphon (1994) and The White Gryphon (1995, both DAW), YAs will enjoy this story. There is enough explanation and background given to understand the history behind the setting and characters.?Beth Devers, Fairfax County Public Library, VA<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ella Fitzgerald</h2><p>The life of the very private and media-shy Ella Fitzgerald has long been shrouded in a mixture of half-truths and fiction. What emerges in Stuart Nicholson's groundbreaking biography is a remarkable story of a poor black girl's determination to realize the American Dream in the face of racial and sexual prejudice. She succeeded, and is now the definition of "jazz singer" to millions, one of the greatest of all jazz musicians. In this fullest account ever of her life, Nicholson draws on fresh research and interviews with Ella's friends and colleagues. Supplemented by Phil Schaap's authoritative discography, <i>Ella Fitzgerald</i> is a rich and revealing portrait of one of the most popular American singers in history.</p><p>Ella Fitzgerald, who died in 1996, came from a poverty-stricken background. She was abandoned by her father, possibly abused by her stepfather and lived on the streets as a teenager. As a club singer she had to contend with racism, sexism and advances from predatory men. But in the 1950s, just when Billie Holiday, from a similar background, was falling toward drug addiction and a sordid death, Fitzgerald escaped the seeming inevitability of that fate. Her songbook albums relaunched her career in a new direction, and she became a beloved figure in American jazz, known for her musical precision and luminous clarity. This biography offers an assessment of the emotional strength apparent in both her life and music.<b>Stuart Nicholson's</b> books include <i>Jazz: The 1980s Resurgence</i> and <i>Billie Holiday.</i> He lives in England.</p><h2>Willful Creatures</h2><p><p>"Contemporary fairy tales, cushioned by goofy humor and a deep tenderness for her characters, that aren't always as dark or as sinister as they initially appear." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>Aimee Bender&#x2019;s <i>Willful Creatures </i>conjures a fantastical world in which authentic love blooms.

Her debut novel was called "as light as a zephyr and unique as a snowflake" ("Washington Post), "a seductively smart read" ("Glamour), and "surreal, edgy, and endearing all at once" ("USA Today).<br>Bender is a brilliant stylist, using language with the nimble grace of a magician. She conjures surreal worlds in which authentic emotion blooms. A woman's children may be potatoes, but the love she feels for them is heartbreakingly real.

To read these diaries&#x2014;filled with Reagan&#x2019;s trademark wit, sharp intelligence, and humor&#x2014;is to gain a unique understanding of one of the most beloved occupants of the Oval Office in our nation&#x2019;s history.</p><p><p>Ronald Reagan was the 40th President of the United States.</p>THE REAGAN DIARIES, spanning the years 1981-1989, open with an introduction by the editor, which gives a broad overview of Reagans presidency and personal life, nicely establishing the context in which these diaries were written. Delivering the diaries themselves with Reagans own phrasing and pacing, narrator Eric Conger begins to sound much like the Great Communicator himself. Subject matter ranges from the historic to the mundane, often in the same entry. Reagans voice as delivered by Conger is clear and recognizable throughout. Extras include swelling martial music bracketing each discs presentation and a final disc that presents excerpts from nine of the presidents actual speeches.

Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys.: A Memoir</h2><p><p><b>A feminist musician icon, Viv Albertine reveals the rocking, uncompromising story of her life on the front lines at the birth of the British punk movement and beyond in this exciting, humorous, and inspiring memoir.</b></p><p><b>Selected by the <i>New York Times</i> as one of the 50 Best Memoirs of the Past 50 Years</b></p><p>Viv Albertine is a pioneer. As lead guitarist and songwriter for the seminal band The Slits, she influenced a future generation of artists including Kurt Cobain and Carrie Brownstein. She formed a band with Sid Vicious and was there the night he met Nancy Spungeon. She tempted Johnny Thunders...toured America with the Clash...dated Mick Jones...and inspired the classic Clash anthem &#x201c;Train in Vain.&#x201d; But Albertine was no mere muse. In <i>Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys.</i>, Albertine delivers a unique and unfiltered look at a traditionally male-dominated scene.</p><p>Her story is so much more than a music memoir. Albertine&#x2019;s narrative is nothing less than a fierce correspondence from a life on the fringes of culture. The author recalls rebelling from conformity and patriarchal society ever since her days as an adolescent girl in the same London suburb of Muswell Hill where the Kinks formed. With brash honesty&#x2015;and an unforgiving memory&#x2015;Albertine writes of immersing herself into punk culture among the likes of the Sex Pistols and the Buzzcocks. Of her devastation when the Slits broke up and her reinvention as a director and screenwriter. Or abortion, marriage, motherhood, and surviving cancer. Navigating infidelity and negotiating divorce. And launching her comeback as a solo artist with her debut album, <i>The Vermilion Border</i>.</p><p><i>Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys.</i> is a raw chronicle of music, fashion, love, sex, feminism, and more that connects the early days of punk to the Riot Grrl movement and beyond. But even more profoundly, Viv Albertine&#x2019;s remarkable memoir is the story of an empowered woman staying true to herself and making it on her own in the modern world.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, December 2014:</strong> Viv Albertine's memoir is a book is divided almost straight down the middle. Side One is the story of her upbringing in the north London suburb of Muswell Hill: It's the mid-seventies, and the Sex Pistols are at the head of a massive, angry (or at least frustrated) cultural insurgence. Her rebellious tendencies have led her into the center of punk culture, and inspired by its outsized personalities and confrontational style, she picks up a guitar, forsaking traditional training for the DIY ethos of the day. After her band with the pre-Pistols Sid Vicious (The Flowers of Romance--a possibly sardonic suggestion from Johnny Rotten) fails to launch, Albertine joins forces with The Slits, a ska-infused, all-girl outfit that, through the force of its collective will and audacity, elbows its way to the front of a stage filled with sharp, mostly male elbows. Everyone is wearing Vivenne Westwood's provocative clothing purchased from Malcolm McLaren's infamous boutique, SEX--at least as much as they could afford. Mick Jones of The Clash wanders in and out of the story, first as a gangly proto-punk spending all of his time and loose change trying to put together a band, and later as Albertine's on-again, off-again boyfriend (the classic London Calling track "Train in Vain" was inspired by her). It's a story in the best rock &amp; roll tradition: Initiative leads. Ability chases. Success looms. Then someone bumps the turntable. </p> <p>Side Two. The band has blown apart. Grownup problems ensue: education and career; marriage and kids; serious illness, divorce, and identity. The actor Vincent Gallo. Albertine moves through all of it, drawing from the same well of determination that compelled her to pick up the guitar for the first time. The two sides of the book may tell very different stories, but they share perspective and style that are both straightforward and ultimately uncompromising. If you love this music (and your library contains titles like <i>Please Kill Me</i> and Richard Hell's <i>I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp</i>), then this book is fascinating and essential. If not, it's fascinating and inspiring. It's occasionally coarse, and often terribly funny and fun.-- <i>Jon Foro</i></p>Songwriter and musician <b>Viv Albertine</b> was the guitarist in the hugely influential female punk band The Slits. A confidante of the Sex Pistols and the Clash, Viv was a key player in British punk culture. Alongside The Slits, she collaborated with numerous musicians, including Adrian Sherwood, before marking out a career in television and film production.

"Yotox" is a new and completely natural alternative anti-aging regimen that women can do anytime and anywhere-and in just minutes. The exercises, developed by yoga expert and instructor Annelise Hagen, are based on a simple principle: The muscles of the face are no different from the muscles of the rest of the body. If you don't exercise the muscles below the neck, they become weak and flabby, and the same thing will happen to your face with age. Just as yoga routines work the muscles in the body, the stretches and movements in Yotox tighten and tone the face muscles-and combat wrinkles. "Working out" with fun facial exercises such as the Louis Armstrong "Satchmo," the Marilyn Monroe "kiss," and the "Lion Face," readers will notice changes quickly; and over time, the results are dramatic. Illustrated with more than seventy-five instructive photos throughout, <i>Yotox</i> offers an easy, safe, and effective solution to help women turn back the clock and have beautiful, young-looking skin.</p><p>Annelise Hagen has taught yoga for eight years in New York City in fitness clubs and yoga studios, such as Equinox, New York Health &amp; Racquet Club, Reebok Sports Club/LA, Crunch, David Barton Gym, Laughing Lotus Yoga Center, and Levitate Yoga.

This collection includes all 29 stories from the first, second, third, and fourth series, originally published in separate volumes.</p><p>Margaret Scott Gatty (1809-1873) was an English writer of children&#39;s literature. She was the daughter of the Rev. Alexander John Scott, D.D., a Royal Navy chaplain, who served under, and was the trusted friend of, Lord Nelson. She married the Rev. Alfred Gatty, D.D., Ecclesfield, Yorkshire, and became a highly useful and popular writer of tales for young people. Among her books may be mentioned Parables from Nature, Worlds not Realised, Proverbs Illustrated, and Aunt Judy&#39;s Tales. She also conducted Aunt Judy&#39;s Magazine, and wrote a book on British seaweeds. Juliana Ewing was her daughter.</p><h2>Wild Tracks!: A Guide to Nature&#39;s Footprints</h2><p>When children learn to recognize and read animal tracks they&#x2019;re actually mastering an ancient language of shapes and patterns&#x2014;and gaining knowledge of the natural world. Acclaimed artist and naturalist Jim Arnosky has created a breathtaking and informative reference on the subject, filled with intricately drawn prints from creatures both wild and domestic, as well as large-scale paintings of the animals in their environment. Some of the art, labeled in Arnosky&#x2019;s own handwriting, even looks as if it came straight out of his personal notebooks. And best of all, many of the tracks are true to size, so kids can compare the trace left by a big-footed polar bear (whose paws act as snowshoes in its icy home) with that of a small bird. Adding to the eye-catching illustrations are four awesome gatefolds that display paintings of a bobcat, wolf, deer, and a variety of hoofed animals right next to their prints. Every spread has plenty of details on how to interpret the footprint, and the featured menagerie includes bighorn sheep and goats, chipmunks and rabbits, grizzlies and brown bears, horses and burros, domestic cats and dogs, and even slithering reptiles! This is the perfect gift for a budding naturalist, animal lover, or artist.<br>Jim Arnosky has been honored for his overall contribution to literature for children by the Eva L. Gordon Award and the Washington Post/Children&#x2019;s Book Guild Award for nonfiction. Many of his books have been chosen as ALA Notable Books, including Drawing from Nature, a Christopher Award-winner.

Readers learn that bears walking on slippery surfaces splay their toes so that their tracks give the impression of a larger animal. Arnosky lets children in on these insiders&#x2019; tips with the amiable tone of a knowledgeable guide. Three kinds of illustrations support the text. The left side of each spread displays one of the artist&#x2019;s signature paintings with a colorful setting backing up a precisely rendered animal. Pencil sketches of rows of tracks with measurements hint at the notebook he keeps (and surely hopes that his young readers will keep as well). Finally, life-size paintings of indented prints serve as a guide for readers lucky enough to find an animal track for comparison. Four fold-out pages add to the appeal of the book as a package...this new entry is worthy of purchase for its inviting format and its promising premise that kids can find tracks, interpret them, and have a great time outdoors." &#x2014;<i>School Library&nbsp;Journal</i>, starred review&nbsp; <p></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2009 ALA Notable<br>Named to 2008 School Library Journal's Best Books of the Year List<br>Winner of the 2008 ASPCA� Henry Bergh Children&#x2019;s Book Award in the Nonfiction Environment and Ecology category</p><h2>A Complete Guide to Chi-Gung: The Principles and Practice of the Ancient Chinese Path to Health, Vigor, and Longevity</h2><p><i>Chi-gung,</i> which literally means "energy work," is a system of cultivating health, vitality, and longevity that is based on the fundamental principles of Taoism and the laws of nature.

He has failed when he should have succeeded and succeeded when he should have failed. The fact that he is neither dead nor in a locked facility (at the time of printing) is something of a miracle in itself.&nbsp;In Craig&#x2019;s candid and revealing memoir, readers will get a look into the mind and recollections of the unique and twisted Scottish American who became a national hero for pioneering the world&#x2019;s first TV robot skeleton sidekick and reviving two dudes in a horse suit dancing as a form of entertainment.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Riding the Elephant</i>, there are some stories that are too graphic for television, too politically incorrect for social media, or too meditative for a stand-up comedy performance. Craig discusses his deep love for his native Scotland, examines his profound psychic change brought on by fatherhood, and looks at aging and mortality with a perspective that he was incapable of as a younger man.&nbsp;Each story is strung together in a colorful tapestry that ultimately reveals a complicated man who has learned to process&#x2014;and even enjoy&#x2014;the unusual trajectory of his life.</p><p><b>Craig Ferguson</b> has worked as a drummer, a bartender, a stand-up comedian, a producer and an actor.

It had value to me only in its sensuality and its ability to satiate my appetites. This was the time when I was ruled by the tyranny of desire. If I couldn't eat it or snort it or own it or drink it or make it cry or laugh or give me money, then it was invisible to me. I had no empathy, but used sentimentality and wit and slurred prose to cloak my ugliness. Even then I was reaching out to find you, almost imperceptible, a daisy on a mountain of shit. Even now when I warm the pool of recollection and look into its depths I can see the ice melt around the old monsters and watch them cast a sleepy eye to the surface on the off chance of an opportunity to attack.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was a time of a quiescent conscience but not a deep, restful sleep. I thrashed around in the nightmares. In the cold light of day though, or in the neon, I didn't give a fuck. I sang and danced and joked in the spotlights; I drank and snorted in the bars and clubs and made as much bloody noise as I could so I couldn't hear the discordant hymns of purity and constancy that whined incessantly at low volume in the background. This was a time when I would tear the burned flesh of the dead with my canines and drink stolen mother's milk so that riding on the back of a majestic, sad, captured god would not even register as an issue of morality. I would not be comfortable riding an elephant today, but I was a different man then, and although I do not ask for your forgiveness for who I was, I humbly apologize to the elephant, wherever she may be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I had been separated from my wife, Anne, for a few months before I attempted my first adult relationship. Her name was Helen and she was an actress. She was English and was older than me and had a cool Mazda RX-7 with pop-up headlights. She wore a perfume called Giorgio that proclaimed proudly that it came from Beverly Hills on its expensive-looking yellow-and-white packaging. Helen had chic Italian clothes with padded shoulders. She had performed Shakespeare in the theater and been on really good television shows and had known Ian Curtis when she was at school. She knew famous people who were still alive too, and she took reasonably priced holidays to exotic places, sometimes with those famous people. She rode horses, for God's sake. She could have groceries in her refrigerator and not eat them all in the same day; she could pay her bills and make appointments on time. I was bewitched by her functionality. That's not to say she was boring. On the contrary, she had a great laugh and an unpredictable temper. She was, to all outward appearances, a well-rounded human being, although I question that now given that she chose to be in a relationship with a recently separated unsuccessful alcoholic stand-up comedian eight years her junior. I was telling a lot of lies to myself about who I was then; perhaps she was unfortunate enough to believe some of them too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Helen wanted to go Sri Lanka. She had read about it in a magazine. She showed me the pictures. Charming jungle scenery and giant golden Buddhas. I didn't care about going to Sri Lanka, but I didn't want Helen to know I was that provincial so I enthusiastically agreed. Although I could ill afford it, I borrowed some more money from my increasingly concerned bank, and we bought tickets and booked a hotel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although Helen had questionable taste in men, she wasn't an idiot; we had separate finances the entire five years we were together. Smart move, I'd say.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with trying to hide active alcoholism from someone you live with is one of balance. You have to drink because you're an alcoholic, but you don't want to appear too drunk because then the poor unfortunate that is supposedly in a relationship with you might insist on you getting help. That's the last fucking thing you want because every drinking alcoholic knows "getting help" means stopping drinking, and that is unthinkable. Keeping your shit together is a tightrope act and is only halfway possible with luck, good timing, and cocaine. Even then it doesn't always work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let's be honest, it hardly ever works.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It never works.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The con I was selling Helen on the flight from London to Sri Lanka was that I was drinking iced tonic water, but on an early bathroom trip I had bribed the charming Tamil flight attendant to slip a double vodka into every drink I asked for. Consequently, I slept most of the second half of the journey, and then had to pretend I didn't have a head like a brown dog as we went through customs and immigration into the surrealism of Colombo at night. I suppose if you live in Colombo it's not strange at all, but if you get off a plane having never experienced anything like it before, it is-or was, I haven't been there in nearly thirty years-a sensory overload in the speedball class, that charming if slightly fatal mixture of heroin and cocaine. Literally takes you in two directions at the same time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The traffic and noise and heat and moisture and smell of the city slammed me the minute I stepped from the airport. The only time I had experienced anything like the climate was in the steam room of one of the health spas that Helen was so fond of. I didn't like the atmosphere of that steam room even when I wasn't wearing jeans and a leather jacket or suffering from a knee-buckling secret vodka headache or experiencing small, fierce taxi drivers yelling at me in a language I didn't understand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We made a deal and got into a taxi, an old Morris Minor. Every vehicle in Colombo was an old Morris Minor except for the buses, which were giant red double-deckers that had been bought as a job lot from London Transport. They still had the black destination signs on the front and I was thunderstruck to see my local, the thirteen to Stoke Newington, rumble past with at least fifty more passengers than would ever have been permitted in London, even at rush hour on a bank holiday Friday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We stayed in a big Western hotel in the city that night and the next day I ate a dog.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I didn't mean to eat a dog. Please don't tell our dogs about this. I was hoodwinked by providence and a horrifying mixture of restaurateur opportunism and the excessive desire of bourgeois tourists to not offend.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Helen wanted to see some of the city before we headed down to the resort we would be staying in on the coast. Like the good little yuppies we were, we wanted to experience the local cuisine, but the authenticity which was essential for dinner party anecdotes dictated we couldn't go anywhere that was in a guidebook or a map. This was the last week of the 1980s. There was no Yelp or Internet or even cell phones, really. We organized our lives by Filofax, which was woefully inadequate for on-the-spot restaurant recommendations. After getting lost in a labyrinthine network of satisfyingly cinematic side streets, we eventually settled on a caf&#x17d; that had a few local customers sitting at a Formica table playing dominoes. There was a ceiling fan that was moving so slowly it could have been a clock, and a neon sign for a beer I'd never heard of.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A friendly apple-cheeked waiter come to our table and said hello enthusiastically. We said hello and asked for a menu and he said hello again and we asked if he spoke English and he said hello again. It became clear that either he was really keen to get his hello message across or he had reached the extent of his knowledge of the language. In the time-honored tradition of travelers, I pointed at the beer sign and held up two fingers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He said hello again and went off to fetch our drinks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While he was away I expressed some reservation about ordering food in this place, but Helen would have none of it. We had to experience it or else what was the point. I said the point might be to avoid dysentery and she called me a racist so I shut up in a huff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Hello came back with what I have to admit were two deliciously cold bottled beers, and after we'd had a few each-Helen never questioned my drinking in tropical climates for some reason-my mood lightened and I decided I was in fact being a racist and we should eat. I asked our waiter for a menu and his answer was, predictably I suppose, Hello.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I mimed opening a book and then eating and he mimed opening a book and shook his head, which I assumed to mean "no menus." He then mimed eating and nodded and waggled his elbows in the universal sign for chicken and said, "Bawk."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Bawk?" I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Bawk," he confirmed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Bawk good?" I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hello," he replied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I said "bawk" again and pointed to myself and mimed eating. He smiled and pointed at Helen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Bawk?" he asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She shook her head and I gave her a stern look.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm not that hungry. I'll just have some of yours," she said, throwing me under the bus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We drank some more beers and got chatting to the domino players and were invited to sit for a game. Dominoes being a splendid pastime which requires no one to speak the same language, things were going swimmingly. I had almost forgotten about my food order until it was placed in front of me. A blue willow-pattern plate bearing a dark brown stew on a bed of white rice. I'll never forget it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That was at a time when I ate chicken. I am, to this day, familiar with the smell and consistency of chicken even when it is diced and smuggled into my presence under a thick blanket of aromatic curry sauce. I know chicken and this, my dear, was not one. Never had been.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Bawk!" said Mr. Hello, proudly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I looked at the plate with suspicion. I glanced at Helen, who looked concerned. I looked at the other players, who were smiling at me in the most charming and friendly "go ahead and eat your lovely plate of chicken" way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Bawk?" I asked again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everybody assured me it was indeed bawk and they all, including Helen at this point, looked excited at the thought of me eating it. I bowed to pressure and took a forkful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You know when you eat dog. Even if you have never eaten dog before, you know. It somehow tastes like you would think it would, which you probably haven't thought about until now. It tastes a little like how dogshit smells but with curry. There was a lot of spice but it was in there. A four-legged friend.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I looked at the waiter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Woof?" I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The domino players and the waiter were horrified. Lots of exclamations and shaking of heads and assurances of bawk. I was skeptical, and when I refused to eat more, an unpleasant tension came into the air. Helen told me I should knock it off and eat more so as not to be rude. I said that it was fucking dog and that if she wanted to be polite she could eat it. She told me she wasn't hungry and anyway she would never knowingly eat a dog. I told her I would never knowingly eat a dog either, and she said she couldn't because she was a former Miss East Cheshire Pony Club, as if that had anything to do with it. In the interest of world peace I took a few more disgusting mouthfuls of man's best friend and then made the tummy-rub sign for being full. Mr. Hello and the Domino Gang seemed to be happy to let it go at that. We paid and left pretty soon afterward and as we walked away from the caf&#x17d; we both pretended not to hear the barking noises and laughing coming from within.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The next day we were driven in a Morris Minor to the coastal resort that we were booked into for a week. Sri Lankan driving may have improved since December 1989, and I hope for the Sri Lankans� sake it has. I also hope they don�t have teenage soldiers at checkpoints every ten miles or so either. That was a bit buttock-clenchy too, although clenched buttocks was exactly what I required given the night I had spent on a Lassie-fueled gastrointestinal thrill ride.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I still felt queasy as we pulled up to the gates of the swanky resort. I don't know if the discomfort was left over from my run-in with Scooby Stew or the sickness I have always felt in the presence of third world economics, a feeling I increasingly experience when I'm in Los Angeles. Extreme wealth flaunting itself up against extreme poverty, or you could express it the other way round, I suppose, if you were a heartless asshole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We drove past a man at the gate who was wearing a threadbare version of what I assumed to be traditional Sri Lankan costume. He was smoking, but took the cigarette from his mouth and waved at us as we drove past. Next to him stood a sad-looking gray Indian elephant. It was large, of course-bigger than the man, bigger than the Morris Minor, bigger than the security gates-but pretty small for an elephant. She (as I later found out) had a decorative headdress on, the type traditionally used on her species by now-defunct cruel circuses. She looked like an old person in a cancer ward who's been dressed up by the nurses for a visitor. It was crushingly sad, or maybe I had a terrible hangover, or maybe both. The man and I locked eyes for a moment and he smiled at me, really smiled. He didn't look sad at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What's that about?" I asked the driver.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That man will give elephant ride, sir. Not as good as a car. Very slow," he told me, helpfully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The resort wasn't particularly expensive, but it was in a part of the world where just a few pounds, dollars, or deutsche marks went a long way. I hated it. I felt guilty being there. The view was beautiful, of course. Open lobby facing out onto an impossible azure ocean and a white-sand beach, but the vista was marred by overweight cartoon Westerners sunning themselves and napping like some tropical species of albino walrus. Uniformed security guards kept local beggars from trespassing onto the precious resort sand or approaching the guests.</p></p><h2>True Gentlemen: The Broken Pledge of America&#x2019;s Fraternities</h2><p><b>An exclusive look inside the power and politics of college fraternities in America as they struggle to survive despite growing waves of criticism and outrage.</b><br> College fraternity culture has never been more embattled. Once a mainstay of campus life, fraternities are now subject to withering criticism for reinforcing white male privilege and undermining the lasting social and economic value of a college education.<br><br>No fraternity embodies this problem more than Sigma Alpha Epsilon, a national organization with more than 15,000 undergraduate brothers spread over 230 chapters nationwide. While SAE enrollment is still strong, it has been pilloried for what John Hechinger calls "the unholy trinity of fraternity life": racism, deadly drinking, and misogyny. Hazing rituals have killed ten undergraduates in its chapters since 2005, and, in 2015, a video of a racist chant breaking out among its Oklahoma University members went viral. That same year, SAE was singled out by a documentary on campus rape, <em>The Hunting Ground</em>. Yet despite these problems and others, SAE remains a large institution with strong ties to Wall Street and significant political reach.<br><br>In <em>True Gentlemen</em>, Hechinger embarks on a deep investigation of SAE and fraternity culture generally, exposing the vast gulf between its founding ideals and the realities of its impact on colleges and the world at large. He shows how national fraternities are reacting to a slowly dawning new reality, and asks what the rest of us should do about it. Should we ban them outright, or will they only be driven underground? Can an institution this broken be saved? With rare access and skillful storytelling, Hechinger draws a fascinating and necessary portrait of an institution in deep need of reform, and makes a case for how it can happen.</p><p><b>John Hechinger</b>, a senior editor at Bloomberg News, was a 2011 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Public Service and a two-time winner of the George Polk Award for his reporting on education.

A homeless teen, a spouse with secrets, and candidates for the now-open bank-manager position all provide clues. The food and party descriptions are as appealing as the mystery plot. Childs, who also writes a scrapbooking series and a series set in a tea shop, keeps all three going strong with engaging characters, clever settings, and crisp writing. Katherine Hall Page fans should add all of Childs&#x2019; series to their must-read lists. --Amy Alessio</p><h2>God&#39;s War on Terror: Islam, Prophecy and the Bible</h2><p>God War on Terror is one of the most important boks ever to be written on End-TImes prophecy. As Walid says, I wasted my college days taking courses on Psycholigy 101, English 101, and Sociology 101 but I never imagined Futurology 101! The bible, as I found it, is not simply a book on personal devotion as is commonly thought; it is a detailed roadmap with mountains of evidence that God exists. His design from time immemorial, regarding man&#39;s destiny, is filled with countless details about the future, especially the coming war with an Islamic coalition against Christianity and Israel. In fact, all of the references in the Bible to nations, against which God declares His war in End-times, you will find, are all Muslim.</p><p>Walid Shoebat was born and raised in Bethlehem, Israel by an Arab father and an American mother. His paternal grandfather was an associate of Haj-Ameen Al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who was an ally of Adolph Hitler, who conspired with the Nazis during the holocaust. Walid grew up a terrorist but when he married a Christian woman, he was challenged to examine the Bible in 1993 and compare it with the Qur'an. That experience made him a convert to Christianity. <p>Joel Richardson is the author of several books including The New York Times bestselling Islamic Antichrist: The Shocking Truth About the Real Nature of the Beast. He is an internationally recognized expert on Biblical prophecy, the Middle East, and Islam, and is a human rights activist and a commentator for WND.</p><p><br> </p><p>From every area of the free world, strong evidence is reaching us of crimes and atrocities committed by Islamic fundamentalists in the name of Allah. A great many Muslims, "educated" people, and our elected leaders known about these crimes; those who do not know, do not know because they do not want to know. They do not ask questions because they are afraid of the answers. They fear the knowledge of what they are tolerating, but the ones among us who are open to seeking truth and justice know how to differentiate between criminals and their victims. The people of the civilized world now have to prove by deed where they stand; mere words will not be believed by a world that witnesses the crimes against God's people and my Christian brethren. <br>In the past I have sinned greatly against God's people, but because of the grace I received through Christ, I am working to rescue them from injustice. <br></p><p><br></p></p><h2>Tarot in Ten Minutes: A Clear and Direct Step-by-Step Method to Unlock the Secrets of the Tarot!</h2><p>THE SECRETS OF THE TAROT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS!<p></p><p><strong>TAROT:</strong> One of the world's oldest and most trusted methods of psychic divination.

From billion-dollar nonprofits to single-person dot.causes, these groups collectively comprise the largest movement on earth, a movement that has no name, leader, or location and that has gone largely ignored by politicians and the media. <br><br> <i>Blessed Unrest</i> explores the diversity of the movement, its brilliant ideas, innovative strategies, and centuries of hidden history. A culmination of Hawken?s many years of leadership in the environmental and social justice fields, it will inspire all who despair of the world?s fate, and its conclusions will surprise even those within the movement itself.</p><p><b>Advanced Praise</b> for BLESSED UNREST by Paul Hawken <p><i>Blessed Unrest</i> is exciting, compelling, and very important. It describes the growing unrest that I encounter around the world, the frustration and courage of those who dare to challenge the power of the political corporate world. Paul Hawken states eloquently all that I believe so passionately to be true - that there is inherent goodness at the heart of our humanity, that collectively we can - and are - changing the world. Please read and share <i>Blessed Unrest</i>, a celebration of the awakening of the human spirit. It will inspire and encourage millions more to take action. <br>-Jane Goodall, UN Ambassador for Peace </p><p>If you have lost a sense of direction in your life, if despair dogs your every step, pick up a pencil and pick up this book. Paul Hawken, without a trace of self-importance, impales a very dark room on the beam of a very bright light here. In his hands, the civil society movement reveals itself as the action that has replaced the talk. <br>-Barry Lopez, author of <i>Resistance and Arctic Dreams</i> </p><p>This is the first full account of the real news of our time, and it's exactly the opposite of the official account. The movers and shakers on our planet aren't the billionaires and the generals--they are the incredible numbers of people around the world filled with love for neighbor and for the earth who are resisting, remaking, restoring, renewing, revitalizing. This powerful and lovely book is their story--our story--and it's high time someone's told it. Nothing you read for years to come will fill you with more hope and more determination. <br>-Bill McKibben, author of <i>Deep Economy</i> and <i>The End of Nature</i> </p><p><i>Blessed Unrest</i> is a beautiful, soulful, crucial book. It is a manifesto of hope for the 21st century grounded squarely in the hearts of engaged people around the planet. Paul Hawken chronicles and testifies on behalf of this "movement with no name" with his charismatic intelligence and insight. This book makes the invisible visible. I believe Hawken when he says we are part of the Earth's immune system each time we exercise our active compassion in the name of social justice and ecological health. I love this book. It is a field guide for all that is possible. <br>-Terry Tempest Williams, author of <i>The Open Space of Democracy</i> </p><p>Many books describe the world in ways that break our hearts. <i>Blessed Unrest</i> invokes a heartbreak from which light pours. Paul Hawken is stupendously well informed. He is also critical without rancor, intuitive without woo woo, and poetic or hard-minded as the case requires. His narrative flows from a harrowing litany of "free market" abuses and desecrations to the countless life-saving actions and organizations that now envelope the earth in response. This is a work of enormous love and consequence. Every compassion-driven soul who reads it will be stunned by the scope and power of the movement we've inadvertently formed. When, inevitably, my daughters someday feels their hearts broken by the wounded world they have inherited, I will be handing them this book of books. <br>-David James Duncan, author of <i>The Brothers K</i> and <i>God Laughs &amp; Plays</i> </p><p>For the first time since life evolved, one species is now altering the physical, chemical, and biological features of the planet on a geological scale. Scientists tell us of a litany of ecological disasters--climate change, toxic pollution, species extinction, marine depletion, deforestation--the depressing list can paralyze one with hopelessness and despair. Fear can motivate immediate action in the short-run, but hope can be sustained. Paul Hawken's writings are always at the cutting edge of environmental thought, original, surprising and shot through with optimism. </p><p><i>Blessed Unrest</i> is an uplifting perspective, engendering wonder and hope. For all of us that are squirreling away in our individual small ways, it is inspiring to realize that millions of us can add up to an irresistible force. Read this book and shout "Hallelujah!" <br>-David Suzuki, author of <i>The Sacred Balance</i> </p><p>Paul Hawken is at the top of his storytelling art in <i>Blessed Unrest</i>. By revealing the twin heart of the environmental and social justice movements, he helps us know ourselves in a new way--as competent members of the natural world, intent on recovering from our stumble as a species. Each page yields surprise and "of course!" recognition for what has been swelling beneath our collective ground for over 100 years. I read it in a single sitting, hungry for the next piece of the puzzle, the next 6-degrees-of-separation coincidence. Hawken makes these invisible truths obvious through impeccably researched tales told in the bell-clear prose of a statesman poet. In this chronicle of the groundswell with no name, we have found our Tocqueville, our Twain, and our Sinclair. <br>-Janine Benyus, author of <i>Biomimicry</i> </p><p>On one side the four horsemen of the apocalypse; on the other a vast and nameless uprising of peoples and organizations fighting for justice, places, communities, diversity, and health--the planetary immune system. Paul Hawken's <i>Blessed Unrest</i> is not just a good book, it is a necessary book, wise, eloquent, perceptive, sober, and timely but above all, hopeful. A landmark! <br>-David Orr, author <i>Design on the Edge and The Last Refuge</i> </p><p>Paul Hawken has written an important and significant book--intelligent, compelling, moving, and hopeful. In the broad sweep of a history of diffuse and seemingly unconnected events and people, he has found emergent pattern. That pattern, amazing simultaneously in its intricacy and simplicity, gives clarity to the direction humankind is moving in its struggle for survival. Read and regain a sense of optimism for our grandchildren's grandchildren; and be motivated to ensure that they inherit a restored earth and an equitable society. <br>-Ray Anderson, CEO of Interface and author of <i>Mid-Course Correction</i></p>Paul Hawken is an environmentalist, entrepreneur, journalist, and author. Starting at age 20, he dedicated his life to sustainability and changing the relationship between business and the environment. His practice has included starting and running ecological businesses, writing and teaching about the impact of commerce on living systems, and consulting with governments and corporations on economic development, industrial ecology, and environmental policy.</p><h2>Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Saga)</h2><p><b>The final novel in #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Nora Roberts' stunning Chesapeake Bay Saga, where the Quinn brothers must return to their family home on the Maryland shore, to honor their father's last request...</b><br><br>It&#x2019;s been a long journey.

Louis tries to maintain his independence, but falls in love with a Harvard seismologist whose discoveries about the earthquakes' cause complicate everything.</p></p><p><b>Jonathan Franzen</b> is the author of three novels: <i>The Corrections, The Twenty-Seventh City</i> and <i>Strong Motion</i>. He has been named one of the Granta 20 Best Novelists under 40 and is a frequent contributor to<i> The New Yorker</i> and <i>Harper's</i>.STRONG MOTION&nbsp;1 <p></p><p>Sometimes when people asked Eileen Holland if she had any brothers or sisters, she had to think for a moment.</p><p>In grade school she and her friends had played foursquare during recess, and when fights broke out in far corners of the playground, it usually turned out that the person whose face was being smashed into the blacktop was her younger brother, Louis. She and her friends would continue to bounce their ball from square to square. They were skipping rope the day Louis fought a boy on the top tier of the old tetanus-infested jungle gym and damaged a different part of himself on each of the pipes he hit during his fall, breaking off his front teeth on level three, bruising his ribs on level two, getting a concussion by impact and whiplash on level one, and stunning his diaphragm on the asphalt. Eileen&#x2019;s friends ran to look at the possibly dead boy. She was left holding the jump rope and feeling as if she&#x2019;d fallen and no one would help her.</p><p>Eileen was a faithful and pretty image of her mother, with astonished dark eyes and pencil-thin eyebrows, a high forehead and plump cheeks and straight dark hair. She had the limbs of a willow tree and sometimes she even swayed like one, with her eyes closed, when she was so happy to be among her friends that she forgot they were there.</p><p>Louis, like his father, was less ornamental. From the age of ten onward he wore aviator-style glasses whose metal frames vaguely matched his hair, which was curly and the color of old brass screws, and was thinning by the time he finished high school. His father had also donated a barrel chest to his genetics. In junior high and high school new friends of Eileen&#x2019;s expected to be told. &#x201c;No, no relation,&#x201d; when they asked her if Louis Holland was her brother. To Eileen these questions were like vaccination shots. The soothing alcohol swab that followed was her friends&#x2019; avowal that her brother was not like her at all.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d agree, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re real different.&#x201d;</p><p>The young Hollands grew up in Evanston, Illinois, in the shadow of Northwestern University, which employed their father as a history professor. Once in a while, in the afternoon, Eileen caught sight of Louis in a booth at McDonald&#x2019;s surrounded by the misfits he hung out with, their snide menu selections, their cigarettes and pasty faces and military clothing. The negativity emanating from his booth made her feel like she couldn&#x2019;t wedge herself tightly enough between the elbows of her peers. She was, she told herself, very different from Louis. But she was never entirely safe from him. Even in the middle of a jammed and laughing back seat she would glance out a window just in time to see her brother striding along the trashy shoulder of some six-lane suburban thoroughfare, his white shirt gray with sweat, his glasses white with road glare. It always seemed that he was there for her alone to see, an apparition from that parallel private world which she herself had stopped living in when she started having friends but which Louis still obviously inhabited: the world where you were by yourself.</p><p>One day in the summer before she started college she suddenly needed to use the family car to see her boyfriend Judd, who lived farther up the Lake Michigan shore in Lake Forest. When Louis pointed out that he&#x2019;d reserved the car a week earlier, she became furious with him, the way a person gets with an inanimate object that she keeps dropping and mishandling. Finally she made her mother go ask Louis to be selfless, just this once, and let her use the car to visit her boyfriend. When she got to Judd&#x2019;s house she was still so furious that she left the keys in the ignition. The car was promptly stolen.</p><p>The Lake Forest police were not particularly nice to her. Her mother was even less nice, on the telephone. And Louis, when she finally got home, came down the stairs in a diver&#x2019;s mask.</p><p>&#x201c;Eileen,&#x201d; her mother said. &#x201c;Honey. You let the car roll in the lake. Nobody stole the car. I just got a call from Mrs. Wolstetter. You didn&#x2019;t set the emergency brake and you didn&#x2019;t put the car in Park. It rolled across the Wolstetters&#x2019; lawn into the lake.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Park, Eileen?&#x201d; Louis&#x2019;s voice was glassed-in and adenoidal. &#x201c;The little &#x2018;P&#x2019; on the far left? N for Neutral? P for Park?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Louis,&#x201d; their mother said.</p><p>&#x201c;Or is it N for No and P for...Proceed? D for Desist?&#x201d;</p><p>After this trauma Eileen could no longer retain information about where Louis was or what he was doing. She knew he went to school in Houston and was majoring in something like electrical engineering, but when her mother alluded to him on the telephone, perhaps to mention that he&#x2019;d changed his major, the room Eileen was calling from suddenly got noisy. She couldn&#x2019;t remember what her mother had just said. She had to ask, &#x201c;So he&#x2019;s majoring in&#x2014;what now?&#x201d; And the room got noisy again! She couldn&#x2019;t remember what her mother was saying even as she said it! And so she never did figure out what Louis was majoring in. When she saw him during Christmas vacation of her second year of graduate school&#x2014;she was getting her MBA from Harvard&#x2014;she had to make a wild guess about what he&#x2019;d been doing since he graduated from Rice: &#x201c;Mom tells me you&#x2019;re, like, designing microchips?&#x201d;</p><p>He stared at her.</p><p>She shook her head no no no no, cancel that. &#x201c;Tell me what you&#x2019;re doing,&#x201d; she said humbly.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m staring at you in amazement.&#x201d;</p><p>Later her mother told her he was working for an FM radio station in Houston.</p><p>Eileen lived near Central Square in Cambridge. Her apartment was on the eighth floor of a modern high-rise, a tower of concrete that loomed above the ambient brick and clapboard like a thing that had failed to erode, with shops and a fish restaurant in the basement. She was at home making triple-fudge brownies one night at the end of March when Louis, whom she&#x2019;d last seen reading a crime novel by the Christmas tree in Evanston, called her up and informed her that he&#x2019;d moved from Houston to the town of Somerville, Cambridge&#x2019;s budget-class neighbor to the north. She asked what had brought him to Somerville. Microchips, he said.</p><p>The person who walked into her apartment a few days later, on a raw late-winter night, was effectively a stranger. At twenty-three, Louis was nearly bald on top, with just enough curls remaining to have captured sleet. His crude black oxfords squeaked on Eileen&#x2019;s linoleum as he walked around her kitchen in a star-shaped path, slowly ricocheting off the counters. His cheeks and nose were red and his glasses were white with fog.</p><p>&#x201c;This is so contemporary,&#x201d; he said, meaning the apartment.</p><p>Eileen pressed her elbows to her sides and crossed her wrists on her chest. She had all four stove burners going full blast and a pot simmering on one of them. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t keep it warm enough,&#x201d; she said. She was wearing a bulky sweater, fluffy slippers, and a miniskirt. &#x201c;I think they turn the furnace off on April first.&#x201d;</p><p>Her doorbell rang. She buzzed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Peter,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Peter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My boyfriend.&#x201d;</p><p>Soon there was a knock on the door, and she led the boyfriend, Peter Stoorhuys, into the kitchen. Peter&#x2019;s lips were blue with cold, and his skin, which was suntanned, was a leaden gray. He hopped up and down, his hands in the pockets of his twills, while Eileen made introductions that he was evidently too frozen to pay attention to. &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; he said, crouching by the stove. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s cold out there.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a tiredness to Peter&#x2019;s face that no suntan could conceal. It was one of those urban faces that had been reconceived so many times that the skin, like a piece of paper smudged and abraded by multiple erasures, had lost its capacity to hold a clear image. Beneath the shadings of his current neo-Angeleno look were visible traces of a yuppie, a punk, a preppie, and a head. Repeated changes of style, like too much combing, had sapped his long blond hair of its resilience. For weather protection he was wearing a houndstooth jacket and a collarless shirt.</p><p>&#x201c;Peter and I were in St. Kitts last month,&#x201d; Eileen explained to Louis. &#x201c;We still haven&#x2019;t readjusted.&#x201d;</p><p>Peter put his white-knuckled hands over two burners on the stove and toasted them, investing this warming process with such importance that there was little Eileen and Louis could do but look at him.</p><p>&#x201c;He looks like a total sillybird in hats,&#x201d; Eileen said.</p><p>&#x201c;I find coats useful in this regard,&#x201d; Louis said, dropping his fiberfill jacket in a corner. He was dressed in his uniform of the last eight years, a white shirt and black jeans.</p><p>&#x201c;You see, that&#x2019;s the thing,&#x201d; Eileen said. &#x201c;His favorite coat is at the cleaner&#x2019;s. Is that a silly place for it to be?&#x201d;</p><p>It was another five minutes before Peter was thawed enough to allow them all to retire to the living room. Eileen curled up on the sofa, pulling the hem of her sweater down over her bare knees and draping one arm over the back of the sofa just in time to receive the glass of whiskey Peter had poured her. Louis paced around the room, stopping to bring his face myopically close to books and other consumer goods. All of the apartment&#x2019;s furnishings were new and most were combinations of white planes, black cylinders, and cherry-red plastic hardware.</p><p>&#x201c;So, Louis,&#x201d; Peter said, joining Eileen with a whiskey. &#x201c;Tell us a little about yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>Louis was examining the VCR&#x2019;s remote-control box.

She used them in several inter-related ways. First, she used them to note things she had read and was researching. Far more often, they were workbooks where she worked through her ideas. Many of the ideas in her completed essays can first be found in her notebooks, and thus the notebooks are invaluable for adding context and nuance along with a sense of development to the reading of those later essays. Finally, her notebooks simply contain Weil&#39;s aphoristic writing at its best in its most striking presentation. For that reason alone, the last two notebooks, which she wrote while in New York and London in 1942-43, published in French as &#34;La Connaissance surnaturel&#34; (&#34;Supernatural Knowledge&#34;) have been read as books of great wisdom. This volume also includes her first notebook from the year 1934, not long after her time in the factory and its subject matter reflects this period in her life.

In her early years, she was known for her brilliant and biting social commentary, and especially for the year she spent working in three Paris factories. After three profound religious experiences, she did not abandon her work on social problems, but also began to write truly original and penetrating religious and philosophical works that still bear on our times, writings that were only published after her death.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Credo: I Believe (Volume 5) (Faith and Life Series)</h2><p>The <i>Faith and Life Third Edition</i> series is a minor update to the <i>Revised Edition</i> series so that all text and liturgical references conform to the implementation of the new Roman Missal. <i>Revised Edition</i> teachers' manuals may continue to be used with the <i>Third Edition</i> text and activity books as the changes are relatively few.

Traditionally they would have to use books that didn't focus on the profession of athletic training and would be much more difficult to follow. The book is unique in carving out the most common drug therapies seen in athletic populations and providing basic principles of the effects of using any pharmacologic agent. It also does a great job outlining federal law and the degree to which it is legal for athletic trainers to dispense. All areas are covered with just enough detail for athletic trainers to be able to devise a protocol for their specific location or practice. This update is necessary because of the changes in the law and in the profession, as well as newer concepts such as pharmacogenetics.&#x201d;<br><br> - Mary E.

As increasing numbers of kids come to school wishing to take action, educators want to know how to teach in a way that fosters a love of nature and an understanding of the complexity and seriousness of these issues.</p><p>In <em>Childhood and Nature</em>, noted educator David Sobel makes the case that meaningful connections with the natural world don't begin in the rainforest or arctic, but in our own backyards and communities. Based on his observations of recurrent play themes around the world, Sobel articulates seven design principles that can guide teachers in structuring learning experiences for children. Place-based education projects that make effective use of the principles are detailed throughout the book. And while engaged in these projects, students learn language arts, math, science, social studies, as well as essential problem-solving and social skills through involvement with nature and their communities. </p><p>The pressures of test preparation, standards, and curriculum frameworks often reduce the study of nature and the environment to a set of facts and general concepts. However, as <em>Childhood and Nature </em>demonstrates, linking curriculum with an engagement in the real world not only provides students with the thinking skills needed for whatever test comes their way, but also helps them grow into responsible citizens and stewards of the earth. </p></p><p><p>David T. Sobel is the director of Teacher Certification Programs in the education department and director of the Center for Place-Based Education at Antioch University New England in New Hampshire.</p><p>Prior to 1997, he served as the chairperson of the department for a dozen years. He was one of the founders of The Harrisville Children's Center and has served on the board of public and private schools. He is a member of the editorial board of the journal&nbsp;<i>Encounter: Education for Meaning and Social Justice</i>and has served as a correspondent for<i>&nbsp;Orion Magazine</i>.</p><p>David received his bachelor's degree in English from Williams College in Williamstown, MA, and his master's degree in elementary education and child development from The Prospect School Teacher Training Program in Vermont and Antioch New England Graduate School in Keene, NH.</p><p>His published books include&nbsp;<i>Children's Special Places</i>,&nbsp;<i>Beyond Ecophobia: Reclaiming the Heart in Nature Education, Mapmaking with Children: Sense of Place Education for the Elementary Years</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Place-based Education: Connecting Classrooms and Communities.</i>His articles examine the relationship between child development, school curriculum and place-based education.

He died twenty-two days later. The cause of death? Polonium&#x2014;a rare, lethal, and highly radioactive substance. Here Luke Harding unspools a real-life political assassination story&#x2014;complete with KGB, CIA, MI6, and Russian mobsters. He shows how Litvinenko&#x2019;s murder foreshadowed the killings of other Kremlin critics, from Washington, DC, to Moscow, and how these are tied to Russia&#x2019;s current misadventures in Ukraine and Syria. In doing so, he becomes a target himself and unearths a chain of corruption and death leading straight to Vladimir Putin. From his investigations of the downing of flight MH17 to the Panama Papers, Harding sheds a terrifying light on Russia&#x2019;s fracturing relationship with the West.</p><p><p>Luke Harding is an award-winning foreign correspondent with <i>The Guardian. </i>Between 2007 and 2011 he was the <i>Guardian</i>'s Moscow bureau chief; the Kremlin expelled him from the country in the first case of its kind since the Cold War.</p>Prologue: <br>The Men from Moscow<br><br>Passport control, Gatwick Airport, Sussex<br>16 October 2006<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Two of the Russians arriving that morning stood out. What precisely made them suspicious was hard to identify. But in the mind of Spencer Scott &#x2013; the detective constable on duty at London&#x2019;s Gatwick Airport &#x2013; there was a curious sense of doubt. It was 16&nbsp;October 2006. Passengers were disembarking from a Transaero flight from Moscow. They were collecting luggage. A stream of new arrivals queued up at passport control, and then proceeded for customs and excise checks.<br><br>The first Russian was of medium height, thirty-something, with blond Slavic hair. He was wearing a casual jacket and carrying an expensive-looking leather laptop case. He appeared prosperous. The second, with dark hair, receding slightly, and a yellowish complexion, was clearly his companion. They weren&#x2019;t behaving oddly as such. And yet there was something &#x2013; a furtiveness that pricked Detective Constable Scott&#x2019;s attention.<br><br>&#x2018;I though they were of interest and basically as they came through immigration controls I stopped them and questioned them,&#x2019; he recalled. Scott hadn&#x2019;t been told to look out for them; he was acting on a hunch. He asked them their names. One man spoke English and identified himself as Andrei Lugovoi. His friend, he said, was Dmitry Kovtun. Kovtun said nothing. It appeared he spoke only Russian. Scott took a grainy low-res photo of them. Lugovoi was on the right. In it they look like dark ghostly smudges. It was 11.34 a.m.<br><br>Lugovoi and Kovtun&#x2019;s story seemed convincing enough: they had flown into London for a business meeting. Lugovoi said he owned a company called Global Project. Moreover, his friend was a member of the finance department at a respectable Moscow bank. Their travel agent had booked them in for two nights at the Best Western Hotel in Shaftesbury Avenue. The hotel wasn&#x2019;t cheap: �300 a night. Lugovoi handed over his reservation. It was genuine.<br><br>Still, there was something unsettling about their answers, Scott felt: &#x2018;They were very evasive as to why they were coming to the UK.&#x2019; Normally, those subjected to a random stop would open up &#x2013; about families, holiday plans, the lousy English weather. The two Russians, by contrast, were elusive. &#x2018;As I asked them questions, they weren&#x2019;t coming out with the answers that I wanted to hear or expected to hear. They were giving me very, very short answers,&#x2019; Scott said. Their replies offered &#x2018;no information&#x2019;.<br><br>Scott looked on the internet but couldn&#x2019;t find Global Project. The Russians told him that their business meeting was with &#x2018;Continental Petroleum Limited&#x2019;, a company based at 58 Grosvenor Street in London. Scott rang the firm&#x2019;s landline. A man answered, confirmed they were registered with the UK&#x2019;s financial authority. OK, then. The constable checked the police database. Nothing. Britain&#x2019;s intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6, hadn&#x2019;t flagged Lugovoi and Kovtun either. Apparently, they weren&#x2019;t of interest. <br><br>A copper&#x2019;s nose was one thing; hard facts another. With no evidence to go on, Scott took soundings from his sergeant, who advised him to let both men &#x2018;go forward&#x2019;. Britain&#x2019;s judicial and police system rests on a presumption of innocence &#x2013; unlike in Russia, Lugovoi and Kovtun&#x2019;s homeland, where judges take informal guidance from above. After twenty minutes the Russians were told they were free to leave. They collected their luggage and headed for central London. Scott put their photo in a file. It was stamped: &#x2018;For intelligence purposes only.&#x2019;<br><br>It was little more than a month later that Scotland Yard &#x2013; faced with a situation of unprecedented international horror &#x2013; realised Scott&#x2019;s instinct had been preternaturally correct. The two weren&#x2019;t businessmen. They were killers. Their cover story was just that. It had been painstakingly constructed over a period of months, possibly years. And it worked.<br><br>That morning, Lugovoi and Kovtun were bringing something into Britain that customs had failed to detect. Not drugs, or large sums of cash. Something so rare and strange and otherworldly, it had never been seen before in this form in Europe or America. <br>It was, as Kovtun put it, talking in confidence to a friend in Hamburg, &#x2018;a very expensive poison&#x2019;. A toxin which had started its surreptitious journey to London from a secret nuclear complex in south-west Siberia. An invisible hi-tech murder weapon.<br><br>Lugovoi and Kovtun were to use it to kill a man named Alexander Litvinenko. Litvinenko was a Russian �migr� who had fled to Britain six years previously. He&#x2019;d become a persistent pain for the Russian government. He was a remorseless critic of Vladimir Putin, Russia&#x2019;s secret policeman turned president. By 2006, Litvinenko was increasingly anomalous: back in Russia many sources of opposition has been squashed.<br><br>There was a particular reason why Putin might want Litvinenko dead. Before escaping in 2000, Litvinenko had worked for the FSB, Russia&#x2019;s intelligence service, and the main successor agency to the KGB. Putin himself had been, briefly, his boss. But Litvinenko now had another employer: Britain&#x2019;s secret intelligence service, MI6. <br><br>Her Majesty&#x2019;s Government had given Litvinenko a fake British passport, an encrypted phone and a salary of �2,000 a month, paid anonymously into his HSBC account and appearing on his bank statement incongruously next to his groceries from Waitrose. He had an MI6 case officer, codenamed &#x2018;Martin&#x2019;.<br><br>Litvinenko wasn&#x2019;t exactly James Bond. But he was passing to British intelligence sensitive information about the links between Russian mafia gangs active in Europe and powerful people at the very top of Russian power &#x2013; including Putin. According to Litvinenko, Russian ministers and their mobster friends were, in effect, part of the same sprawling crime syndicate. A mafia state. It was his contention that a criminal code had replaced the defunct ideology of communism.<br><br>Litvinenko knew about this mafia&#x2019;s activities in Spain; he was, in the words of one friend, a walking encyclopedia on organised crime. So much so that MI6 loaned him out to colleagues from Spanish intelligence in Madrid.<br><br>All of this made Litvinenko a traitor, and the KGB&#x2019;s punishment for spies who betrayed their country was understood. From the very beginning of the Bolshevik revolution in 1917, Moscow had used poisons, bullets, bombs hidden in cakes and other lethal methods to snuff out its &#x2018;enemies&#x2019;, at home and abroad, from Leon Trotsky to Georgi Markov, the Bulgarian dissident and writer poisoned on Waterloo Bridge in 1978 with an ingenious ricin-tipped umbrella. As Stalin famously observed, &#x2018;No man, no problem.&#x2019; <br><br>There was a spectrum. It went from killings that were demonstrative, to those where the KGB&#x2019;s fingerprints were nowhere to be found, however hard you looked. Boris Yeltsin had stayed those methods in the post-communist 1990s; the KGB&#x2019;s poison factory seemingly mothballed; Russia&#x2019;s democrats briefly in the ascendant. Now, under Putin, such methods were back. The FSB was Russia&#x2019;s pre-eminent institution. It was all-powerful, beyond the law, and &#x2013; like its Leninist predecessors &#x2013; a purveyor of state terror. <br><br>In the glory days of the Soviet Union, the KGB dispatched professionals and undercover &#x2018;illegals&#x2019; to carry out extra-judicial murders &#x2013; known in the spy trade as &#x2018;wet jobs&#x2019;. <br><br>Lugovoi and Kovtun&#x2019;s mission to London was supposed to be exactly such an operation: ruthless, clinical, undetectable &#x2013; an iron fist concealed in a velvet glove. It was to be done in the best traditions of the <i>Cheka</i>, the counter-revolutionary police force founded by Felix Dzerzhinsky, Lenin&#x2019;s friend. Dzerzhinsky&#x2019;s statuette with its cold, pinched features sat in Putin&#x2019;s office.<br><br>But, despite a resurgence under Putin, Russia&#x2019;s spy agencies had suffered the same degradation that had blighted all Russian institutions &#x2013; the presidency, Russia&#x2019;s parliament or Duma, medicine, science and technology. Critics said the country, despite its great power pretensions, was slowly dying. Its modern assassins were a shambolic lot. <br><br>The idea was that nobody would notice the visiting Russians. Once they had poisoned their victim they would escape back to Moscow, leaving few ripples on the busy surface of London life. Their target, of course, would die horribly. But the Kremlin&#x2019;s hand would be hidden. The British would mark his death down as a baffling case of gastro-enteritis and those who carried out the murder would return to a life of shadowy anonymity. And, one imagines, reward. The payment for murder, Kovtun hinted, was a Moscow flat.<br><br>It didn&#x2019;t quite work out like that. Russia&#x2019;s poisoning project, when finally accomplished, would prompt a British public inquiry costing millions of pounds. One that examined the masses of evidence collected by the Metropolitan Police, from hotels, restaurants, car seats &#x2013; even from a bronze phallus at a nightclub visited by the assassins in Soho. Scotland Yard was able to reconstruct minute by minute the events leading up to the murder. Its investigation &#x2013; made public more than eight years later &#x2013; was one of the most extensive in criminal history. <br><br>Yet despite this exposure there were soon to be other victims &#x2013; opponents felled in murky circumstances abroad or, like the opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, killed outside the very gates of the Kremlin. Moscow would send tanks across borders, start a war in Europe, and annex a large chunk of neighbouring territory. Its proxies &#x2013; or possibly Russian servicemen &#x2013; would blow a civilian plane out of the sky.<br>The common theme here was contempt: a poisonous disregard for human life. For Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s critics have an uncanny habit of turning up dead.</p><h2>Race Across Alaska: First Woman to Win the Iditarod Tells Her Story</h2><p>Explores the history of the trail and celebrated the frontiersmen and their dogs who braved its dangers.</p><p>Libby Riddles and Tim JonesBorn in Wisconsin, Riddles was 16 when she moved to Alaska in 1972. After working at various odd jobs and becoming involved in sled dog racing, in 1985 she entered the "Iditarod," a grueling sled-dog marathon on the Iditarod Trail from Anchorage to Nome. Nineteen days and 1200 miles later, she emerged from a raging blizzard and crossed the finish line to become the first woman to win this race. This fast-paced description of her bout against both the elements and veteran competitors generates electrical excitement. Former newspaper editor Jones (the Chicago Tribune and the Wall Street Journal, among others) contributes short background articles covering trail history, fabric booties that protect the dogs' feet, checkpoint procedures, etc. There are 11 black-and-white photos and maps at the beginning of each chapter showing Riddles's daily position. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dragon&#39;s Fire (The Dragonriders of Pern)</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER </b>�<b> &#x201c;A richly detailed story on a par with the rest of the Pern canon . . . another successful McCaffrey mother-and-son collaboration.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Booklist </i></b><br><br>At Natalon&#x2019;s mining camp, Pellar embarks on a secret mission to discover whether the condemned criminals known as the Shunned are stealing coal.

Every now and then the wagon skidded as the workbeast lost his footing on the hard-packed icy snow and struggled to regain it.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, he is,&#x201d; Cayla agreed, looking back out of the brightly painted wagon at the small figure slowly diminishing in the distance.<br><br> &#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t bring him,&#x201d; Zist said regretfully. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d be too obvious.&#x201d;<br><br> At least, Zist thought to himself, the lad was taking it better than he had when they&#x2019;d first told him their plans.<br> Pellar had thrown a silent tantrum, had sprawled on the ground in the Harper Hall&#x2019;s courtyard, feet and fists hitting the ground in his outrage. He stopped only when Carissa had started howling in sympathy with him.<br><br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s crying for me, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d; he scrawled quickly on the slate that was never far from his hands.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, I suppose she is,&#x201d; Cayla answered.<br><br> Pellar swiftly rubbed his slate clean and scrawled a new comment on it, thrusting it under Zist&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;Are you taking her?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We have to, she&#x2019;s still nursing.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We want to know that you&#x2019;re safe, here,&#x201d; Cayla added.<br><br> &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t I part of your family?&#x201d; Pellar scrawled in response, tears streaming down his face.<br><br> &#x201c;Of course you are!&#x201d; Zist declared vociferously. &#x201c;And we need you, as a member of our family, to stay here out of trouble.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You are always part of our family, Pellar,&#x201d; Cayla said firmly.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been part of our family since we first found you, ten Turns ago,&#x201d; Zist told him.<br><br> &#x201c;Then why can&#x2019;t I come?&#x201d; Pellar scrawled on his slate, his mouth working soundlessly in emphasis.<br><br> &#x201c;Because we don&#x2019;t know who abandoned you,&#x201d; Zist told him, catching Pellar&#x2019;s chin in his hand and forcing the youngster to meet his eyes. &#x201c;It could be some who were Shunned. If you come with us and they see you, they&#x2019;ll know that we&#x2019;re not Shunned.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You could get in trouble then?&#x201d; Pellar wrote. Zist nodded. Pellar chewed his lip miserably, shoulders shaking so hard with his unvoiced sobs that he could barely wipe his slate to write a new message. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stay. No trouble for you.&#x201d;<br><br> Cayla read the note, thrust baby Carissa into Zist&#x2019;s arms, and grabbed Pellar into a firm and fierce hug.<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my boy,&#x201d; she said proudly, kissing the top of his head.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be here when you get back,&#x201d; Pellar wrote.<br><br> &#x201c;I promise you&#x2019;ll be the first to hear us return,&#x201d; Zist swore, freeing a hand to clap the boy on the back.<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s stopped waving,&#x201d; Cayla reported. &#x201c;Oh, dear! His shoulders are all slumped and he looks so sad.&#x201d;<br><br> Zist blew out a misty breath and pulled on the reins controlling the workbeast, fighting with himself not to turn the wagon back.<br><br> &#x201c;Murenny promised he&#x2019;d keep an eye on him,&#x201d; Cayla said, noting how the wagon had slowed. &#x201c;And this was your idea.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Zist agreed, his shoulders slumping in turn. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s absolutely necessary that we learn all we can about the Shunned&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t disagree with you,&#x201d; Cayla interjected, lifting baby Carissa in her arms and rocking her instinctively.<br><br> &#x201c;Thread will come again soon enough, and what then?&#x201d; Zist went on, repeating his reasons needlessly. &#x201c;If there are enough Shunned, what&#x2019;s to stop them from overwhelming a hold or craft hall?&#x201d;<br><br> Cayla didn&#x2019;t have to say a word to make her opinion of that clear; she&#x2019;d said enough before.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, even if they don&#x2019;t, what will they do when Thread comes again?&#x201d; Zist asked reflectively. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not right to condemn them all to a death no one on Pern should ever experience.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know, love, I know,&#x201d; Cayla said soothingly, recognizing that her mate was working himself into another passionate discourse. She knew from past discussions how vivid the image of Thread, falling mindlessly from the sky, devouring all life, searing all flesh, was engrained in Zist&#x2019;s mind from his reading. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve discussed this, Murenny&#x2019;s discussed this, and that&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re here in this wagon, dressed like the Shunned&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Do you think we should put an &#x2018;S&#x2019; on your head, too?&#x201d; Master Zist asked, pointing to the purple-blue mark on his forehead.<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Cayla said in a tone that brooked no argument. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;d best be right about how to get that mark off.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not proper bluebush ink,&#x201d; Zist reminded her. The sap of the bluebush, used for marking the Shunned, was indelible and permanently stained skin. &#x201c;Some pinesap, lots of hot water and soap, and it&#x2019;ll come off.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So you&#x2019;ve said,&#x201d; Cayla remarked, sounding no more convinced.<br><br> In front, Zist noticed that the workbeast was slowing and flicked the reins to encourage it back to a faster walk.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re with me,&#x201d; Zist told Cayla, after satisfying himself that they were moving fast enough.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad that we left Pellar behind,&#x201d; Cayla said. &#x201c;Ten Turns is too young to see the sights we expect.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Zist agreed.<br><br> &#x201c;Carissa&#x2019;s so little that she&#x2019;ll remember none of it,&#x201d; Cayla continued, half to answer Zist&#x2019;s unspoken thought, half to answer her own fears.<br><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be children among the Shunned,&#x201d; Zist remarked. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s part of what makes it so wrong.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Cayla agreed. She flicked a wisp of her honey-blond hair back behind her ear and continued rocking little Carissa. Then she looked back again. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s gone now.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be back in less than half a Turn,&#x201d; Zist said after a moment of thoughtful silence. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be all right.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I hope he&#x2019;ll forgive us,&#x201d; Cayla said.<br> Zist took the coast road south, toward Hold Gar, Southern Boll Hold, and warmer weather. He and Cayla had guessed that the warmer climes would attract the Shunned, who would find the harsh winters of the north harder to survive.<br><br> The road was still snow-covered and never more than a pair of ruts running down along the coastline. Even in the protected enclosure of the wagon, Cayla wrapped herself up tightly and nuzzled little Carissa close to her side to keep them both warm. In front, perched on the rattling bench seat, Zist had a thick wher-hide blanket spread over his knees and layers of warm thick-knit Tillek sweaters, the same as those used by the Tillek sailors because they kept out the worst of the wet and cold even at sea. Even so, Zist was chilled to the bone every evening when they halted.<br><br> They were both relieved when they finally came upon the outskirts of Hold Gar.<br><br> Their reception by the holders was sharp and unpleasant.<br><br> &#x201c;Go away!&#x201d; shrieked the first old woman whose cothold they had stopped at, hoping to barter for food. &#x201c;Would you have me Shunned, too?&#x201d;<br><br> She hurried them on their way by throwing stones and setting her dogs on them.<br><br> &#x201c;Go back north and freeze! We&#x2019;re hardworking folk down here,&#x201d; she yelled after them. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t find any handouts.&#x201d;<br><br> Zist shared a shaken look with Cayla who busily tried to comfort a bawling Carissa.<br><br> As they neared the next hold, Cayla glanced quickly at the &#x201c;S&#x201d; on Zist&#x2019;s forehead. &#x201c;Maybe I should go by myself,&#x201d; she suggested.<br><br> &#x201c;Bring the baby,&#x201d; Zist agreed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tend the beast.&#x201d;<br><br> Carissa returned later, smiling and carrying a sack full of goods.<br><br> &#x201c;They cost more than they should,&#x201d; she said when she handed the bag to Zist. &#x201c;The lady fed us, though, and had fresh milk for Carissa.&#x201d;<br><br> Two days later they came upon a wagon by the side of the road. It had been burned down to the wheels.<br><br> Zist halted. He went to the wreck, crawled around and through it, and came back thirty minutes later, his face grim.<br><br> &#x201c;They were caught while they were sleeping,&#x201d; he told Cayla.<br><br> &#x201c;How do you know it wasn&#x2019;t an accident with a lantern?&#x201d; Cayla asked. While holders used glows, the Shunned had to make do with what they could scrounge, and that often meant candles or lanterns.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather not say,&#x201d; he replied grimly.<br><br> &#x201c;I suppose we should keep a watch at nights,&#x201d; Cayla said.<br><br> &#x201c;Maybe we should turn back,&#x201d; Zist said. &#x201c;This is beginning to seem more dangerous than I&#x2019;d feared.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Perhaps this is what happened to Moran.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; Zist agreed, his face going pale. With a sour look, he gestured to the burned wreck. &#x201c;There has to be a better way to deal with the Shunned.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know what happened here. We know that some were Shunned for murder. After being Shunned, what would stop them from murdering again?&#x201d; Cayla responded. &#x201c;Perhaps we&#x2019;re only seeing justice done.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Zist said, shaking his head firmly. &#x201c;That was a wagon much like ours.&#x201d;<br><br> Cayla realized from what he&#x2019;d left unsaid that the occupants of the wagon were much like them, too&#x2014;a man, woman, and child.<br><br> &#x201c;We should move on before we attract attention,&#x201d; she said firmly.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like you to keep watch from the back of the wagon,&#x201d; Zist said by way of agreement.<br><br> &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><h2>Rameau&#39;s Nephew and D&#39;Alembert&#39;s Dream (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot&#x2014;of the triumvirate that dominated French letters in the eighteenth century, Diderot was unmatched in the sheer breadth and depth of his interests and ideas. <i>Rameau&#x2019;s Nephew</i> and <i>D&#x2019;Alembert&#x2019;s Dream</i> are dazzling expos�s of Diderot&#x2019;s radical scientific and philosophical thinking. Written in dialogue form, they were too outspoken to be published during the lifetime of one whose ideas earned him enemies as fast as they stimulated new criteria for social progress. Of the two pieces, <i>Rameau&#x2019;s Nephew</i> was composed over many years, and in form and content it is an explosive cocktail unlike anything in French literature before or since. <i>D&#x2019;Alembert&#x2019;s Dream</i>, on the other hand, was committed to paper in a matter of days; a clarion call for the cause of materialist determinism, it too shows Diderot as one of the most advanced thinkers of his age and is a powerful testament to the bizarre and unpredictable genius of its creator.</p><p>Denis Diderot was born at Langres in eastern France in 1713, the son of a master cutler. He was originally destined for the Church but rebelled and persuaded his father to allow him to complete his education in Paris, where he graduated in 1732. For ten years Diderot was nominally a law student, but actually led a precarious bohemian but studious existence, eked out with tutoring, hack-writing and translating. His original writing began in 1746 with a number of scientific works setting out the materialist philosophy which he was to hold throughout his life. Along with his editorship of the <b>Encyclop�die</b> (1747-73), he wrote works on mathematics, medicine, the life sciences, economics, drama and painting, two plays and a novel, as well as his <b>Salons</b> (1759-81). His political writings were mainly composed around 1774 for Catherine II, at whose invitation he went to St. Petersburg. Diderot's astonishingly wide range of interests, together with his growing prediliction for the dialogue form, led to the production of his most famous works: <b>D'Alembert's Dream</b>, <b>The Paradox of the Actor</b>, <b>Jacques the Fatalist</b> and <b>Rameau's Nephew</b>. During the latter part of his life Diderot received a generous pension from Catherine II, in return for which he bequeathed her his library and manuscripts. He died in 1784.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Edge of Eternity</h2><p><b>Imagine Being Pulled Into the Hereafter.

None of those who occupied the towers and could look down on all who passed; none of those stationed to either side of the gates themselves, armed and ready to act to defend the city should a threat present itself. Not even any of those standing atop the walls overlooking the approach, all of whom had the longest span of time and clearest opportunity to observe him.<br><br>He was beneath their notice.<br><br>He was ragged and sweat-�stained, and while he walked steadily enough, there was an air of weariness about him that confirmed his visible circumstances. Others traveling the road passed him by easily, and none of them paid him but a moment&#x2019;s notice, either. The pilgrim was hooded, so it was impossible to see his face within the shadows of his covering&#x2014;�not without making an effort, and no one felt inclined to do so. He was just one more visitor to the Federation Capital City, one more visitor come to view the most wondrous Southland edifice constructed in the last fifty years.<br><br>Indeed, the city of Arishaig frequently astounded the men and women of the Four Lands. Rebuilt after the demons of the Forbidding had burned it to the ground, it was nothing if not formidable. Constructed to withstand any attack launched against it&#x2014;�whether by demons and dragons or things more fearful still&#x2014;�Arishaig had become a fortress that defied all attackers. Its walls soared hundreds of feet high and were thicker than the tightened formation lines of a shield-�and-�spear rank. Its battlements were studded with flash rips and rail slings loaded and ready to release, all mounted on swivels that directed fire accurately and broadly. Airships were situated on elevated landing pads in each of the four corners of the city proper, with flits and skiffs and other assorted quick-�moving fliers readily available for the use of First Response&#x2014;�the company formed years earlier to serve as an initial line of defense against all assaults on the city.<br><br>Within, an inner wall shadowed the outer, and within both rings the entire population save those engaged in labor on the outlying farms worked and resided. Five million people lived within Arishaig now&#x2014;�and some claimed there were even more. Even the bulk of the Federation army was housed and trained inside those walls. And at its exact center, the Phoenix Tower&#x2014;�symbol of a Federation city raised from the ashes of the old&#x2014;�towered above all, rising more than thirty stories into the clouds. The Coalition Council occupied it. The Federation government&#x2019;s offices, living quarters, healing centers, education adjuncts, and food storage warehouses formed a compound more than a mile square.<br><br>All this awaited the traveler in the gray robes, but he kept his eyes on the road ahead. He already knew what lay within. He had passed this way before.<br><br>A flurry of skyward motion, coupled with the sound of expended power from diapson crystals exploding through parse tubes, caught his attention, and for a second he slowed. Ghost Flares roared overhead, the fastest of the airships, looking like naught but black shadows as they flashed past. All eyes turned skyward to watch. Even the gray-�robed pilgrim paused.<br><br>But only so he would not attract attention by choosing to move while the others stood still.<br><br>At the gates, he waited in line for permission to pass. Others crowded ahead of him, and he let them do so. Patience in all things, he reminded himself. When it was his turn to approach, he did so almost reluctantly, his robes dragging on the ground, his head lowered.<br><br>The soldiers judging the merits of those seeking admission barely looked at him. &#x201c;Name?&#x201d; said one.<br><br>&#x201c;Raushka.&#x201d; His voice was as weary as his look.<br><br>&#x201c;Home?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am from Sterne.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Business?&#x201d;<br><br>A moment&#x2019;s hesitation. &#x201c;I seek medical care.&#x201d;<br><br>Now the soldier looked up. &#x201c;What sort of medical care?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Surgery to repair flesh damaged in a fire. I require a reconstruction.&#x201d;<br><br>Another soldier stepped forward to join the first. Both peered at him questioningly. &#x201c;Where were you burned?&#x201d; the new man asked.<br><br>&#x201c;My face.&#x201d;<br><br>The soldiers exchanged a glance. &#x201c;Let me see,&#x201d; said the first.<br><br>The pilgrim hesitated. &#x201c;I would advise against it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fellow, we are soldiers,&#x201d; said the second. &#x201c;What we have already seen would turn your innards to jelly. Let us be the judge of what we can and cannot stand to look upon.&#x201d;<br><br>A long silence. &#x201c;As you wish.&#x201d;<br><br>He lifted his head slightly and pulled back the hood. The soldiers&#x2019; faces turned ashen. People around them gasped and flinched back. One woman turned her head and vomited. The pilgrim stood without moving, his face and head exposed, his eyes&#x2014;�or the one eye that remained&#x2014;�fixed on the soldier who claimed to have seen the worst of everything.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough,&#x201d; the soldier said, shaking his head in dismay. &#x201c;Cover yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>The pilgrim did so, again assuming a slightly bent position so that his face retreated once more into the hood&#x2019;s shadows.<br><br>The speaker took a deep breath. He didn&#x2019;t even bother looking at his fellow. &#x201c;If there is help for you here, it surpasses any form of healing I am familiar with. Go on, now, and find it if you can.&#x201d;<br><br>The pilgrim moved on, into the shadow of the gates, into the throngs that crowded the streets beyond. Behind him, there were mutterings and exclamations, oaths and wardings. Everyone was unsettled by what they had seen.<br><br>Just as the pilgrim had intended.<br><br>When the door to his shop opened an hour later and the pilgrim walked through, the old man who was the shop&#x2019;s owner and sole occupant glanced up in the manner of the soldiers at the gate, but was quicker than they were to revise his level of interest. The pilgrim was not who he appeared to be; the owner recognized this at once. It was his business to deal with men and women who specialized in deception and trickery, and he knew this one. So instincts honed on a thousand such encounters kept him from being caught off guard.<br><br>The gray-�robed horror approached the counter and stopped. He did not look up. He did not lift his face into the light. &#x201c;You have what I ordered?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do,&#x201d; the old man replied. &#x201c;Do you wish it now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In a minute. Tell me, is your business much improved since leaving Sterne? Is it not doing better in Arishaig?&#x201d;<br><br>The question seemed innocuous, but no question asked by this man ever was. &#x201c;I am content.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You traffic in so many wondrous things. It must be easier finding them here, in such a large city.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is easier, yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you remember it was I who sent you here? I who told you to leave Sterne before the unfortunate events involving the Red Slash? You remember this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I could hardly forget. And I will always be grateful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Opportunities abound?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But where there are greater opportunities, there are greater temptations, as well. Opportunities present themselves&#x2014;�opportunities that require acts once believed unthinkable. What does it matter if you commit a small betrayal when doing so might result in the acquisition of a considerable fortune?&#x201d;<br><br>The old man went cold. &#x201c;Such acts serve little purpose if you are a dead man. It is much better to stay faithful to those who have been faithful to you.&#x201d;<br><br>The pilgrim laughed softly. &#x201c;I would expect you to say as much.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is there some reason you think I have deceived you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;None. I ask only to reassure myself. If you were to lie, I would see it in your eyes. Why don&#x2019;t you show me what you have been holding for me?&#x201d;<br><br>The old man took the pilgrim into the back of his shop. This establishment was much like the one he had managed in Sterne&#x2014;�small, cramped, and shabby, filled with this and that&#x2014;�a place where no discernible order or purpose revealed itself to any save himself. He still mostly provided information and access, although now and then&#x2014;�and for his better customers&#x2014;�he also provided supplies. He had done so for this man, this monster.<br><br>The back of the store was much like the front, although so crammed with boxes and crates that almost no open space was available. The two of them barely found room to maneuver as the old man released the spring catch hidden in the wall behind the false crate and pulled out the garments hung within.<br><br>&#x201c;You may try them on here, if you wish,&#x201d; he offered.<br><br>The pilgrim lifted his head far enough that his distorted features were revealed. The old man shuddered inwardly but kept from showing his horror. &#x201c;An imaginative disguise,&#x201d; he managed.<br><br>A thin laugh. &#x201c;Not a disguise, exactly. More a reordering of flesh, blood, and bone through a careful employment of magic. I wished to look a certain way and I found the means by which to do so. I took no chances of discovery.&#x201d;<br><br>The shopkeeper bowed in acknowledgment. &#x201c;Very clever.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will need a basin filled with hot water, towels, and a mirror.&#x201d; The pilgrim&#x2019;s face lowered once more into shadow. &#x201c;Can you provide me with these?&#x201d;<br><br>The old man beckoned. &#x201c;My apartment is next door. Come.&#x201d;<br><br>They went outside. The old man locked the door to his business behind him, then walked a dozen steps to another door. A stairway took them to an upstairs hallway. His was the second door on the left. He unlocked it and they entered. Once inside, he started to lock the door behind them when the pilgrim stopped him.<br><br>&#x201c;Go back to your shop and wait for me there. Leave the key to these rooms. I will lock up when I am done and return the key before leaving.&#x201d;<br><br>Bowing, the old man did as he was ordered. There was never any question of doing otherwise. He left the apartment, went back down the stairs, and returned to his shop. He took a few minutes to close up his hiding place in the back room and reseal the false crate front. Then he waited, occupying himself with cataloging the cost of his services and watching the clock on the wall tick slowly toward the new hour. He was not afraid of this man, but he was wary. It did not matter that he would never betray him. If the man even suspected he had, he would be dead. There was no predicting a man like that. He would rest easier when this business was finished.<br><br>He did not have to wait much longer. Approximately thirty minutes later, the shop door opened. The man who entered was garbed in black robes of fine quality, with silver embroidery woven into the edges of the sleeves. A patch was sewn into the breast panel over his heart&#x2014;�an insignia well known throughout the Four Lands. It was called the Eilt Druin and displayed the image of a hand holding forth a burning torch. It could be found on the robes of all members of the Fourth Druid Order.<br><br>The face of the pilgrim had changed yet again; now he was someone else entirely. The shopkeeper did not know this man, and he thought it would be best if he forgot him right away. It would be best if he took even the memory of that face to the grave with him.<br><br>&#x201c;Excellency,&#x201d; he said instead. &#x201c;Always your servant.&#x201d;<br><br>The other man made no response but merely handed back the key to the shopkeeper&#x2019;s apartment. The old man took it and pocketed it. The man who pretended to be a Druid then handed him a fistful of credits&#x2014;�far more than the shopkeeper had expected for his services.<br><br>&#x201c;Remember this,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;I always reward those who serve me well, and I always find out about those who don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>Then he turned and went through the door, his black Druid robes billowing out behind him. The old man walked to the doorway and watched him go. Even after the stranger was gone, he waited almost an hour, just to be sure. Then he closed up his shop and retired to his apartment. Once there, he counted out the credits he had been paid and swore he would never do this again.<br><br>But he was lying to himself; he would always do whatever this man told him to.<br><br>Because it was never a good idea to say no to Arcannen Rai.<br><br>Two<br><br>Leofur Rai stood at the parapets of the inner walls of Paranor, staring out over the miles and miles of deep woods that surrounded the Druid&#x2019;s Keep. She studied the emerald canopy with intense concentration, as if she might find something that was hidden. Then, pushing back from the walls, she began wandering the ramparts, looking at her feet as she walked, wondering where she was going&#x2014;�not here specifically, of course, but in the wider course of her life. She remained unsure, even after a year of searching. An entire year spent living in Paranor.<br><br>Paxon had brought her to Paranor after they had lived together for a time in Wayford&#x2014;�an arrangement arrived at spontaneously and with considerable misgivings on her part. She could still recall the night he appeared on her doorstep after a five-�year absence. He had looked so desperate, so lost, that her heart had broken for him. At the time, she had been convinced that he was never returning&#x2014;�that he had chosen a different path from the one she had once imagined they would take together, and there was nothing she could do about it. So it was a shock that he had found his way back.<br><br>A shock that, after it lessened, would arouse suspicion, regret, and deep uncertainty.<br><br>But she had taken him in. Her feelings for him were still strong enough that she was not prepared to cast him out, so she had brought him into her home and into her life in less than a week. He was damaged, she knew, and needed time to recover. He had left the Druid order. He was thinking of abandoning his post as the High Druid&#x2019;s Blade. What happened to him when he faced the sorcerer Arcannen in the city of Sterne, and thereafter when he searched for&#x2014;�and found&#x2014;�the strange boy who had inherited the magic of the wishsong, had undone him. He was still Paxon, but hollow and directionless, and believed she was the true north that might lead him out of the wilderness. <br><br>The love they found grew slowly but steadily. The seeds had been planted even before his return. Like flowers buried in fertile soil, love had broken through and bloomed into something amazing. She had doubted it for a time, wary of such miracles, but in the end had given herself to it readily. He wanted her; he needed her. He was where he belonged with her. She could feel it in his words and actions. But would it last? She couldn&#x2019;t be sure. She only knew it was worth finding out.<br><br>Then, inevitably perhaps&#x2014;�when he had come all the way back from his dark uncertainty&#x2014;�he had decided to return to Paranor. Perhaps only for a while, perhaps never again as the Blade, but Chrysallin was there, and he could not let his sister stay longer without him. He was afraid for her. She was vulnerable without his steadying presence&#x2014;�something the Druid order might try to take advantage of.<br><br>It was her voice, of course. The power of her voice was enough to destroy someone as powerful as the witch Mischa&#x2014;�now, there was magic the Druid order would love to get its hands on! If Chrysallin could be persuaded to use it for their purposes . . . <br><br>But of course, it wasn&#x2019;t that simple. Chrys had suffered a breakdown during her battle with Mischa and had blocked out all memory of what had transpired. She had no idea that she possessed this power, no hint she had inherited the fabled wishsong from her Ohmsford ancestors.<br><br>Leofur turned, looking away from the forest and down into the south courtyard where the gardens flourished. Chrysallin sat amid a profusion of colors and scents, her eyes closed, her hands clasped loosely in her lap, meditating. It was Leofur who had taught her this technique.<br><br>As she watched Paxon&#x2019;s sister,...</p><h2>Art Nouveau Typographic Ornaments (Dover Pictorial Archive)</h2><p>The turn-of-the-century Arts and Crafts movement revitalized many art-craft domains, including of course typography. One sidelight to the typographic art, but one in which many printers specialized, was the typographical ornament &#x2014; long a tradition among the very earliest printers, once again brought to the <i>avant garde</i> of design. <br>The best American and European printers offered whole catalogs of original ornament in the Art Nouveau manner &#x2014; today they survive only in the archives of printers and historians of type. Here, from the archives of a contemporary typesetter and printing historian, is a selection of authentic Art Nouveau typographic ornament, culled out of late 19th and early 20th century specimen catalogs. Over 800 ornaments of all types include the patented Art Nouveau florals and flowing botanic wonders, both realistic and abstract. Women draped in pagan robes form borders and head and tailpieces. Animals abound: fish, elephants, turtles, birds, and creatures of myth and fancy. Innumerable spots, shapes, symbols, emblems, wreaths, scrolls, cherubs, and gargoyles show in clear black and white how they will look decorating menus, posters, handbills, ads, books, any functional or artistic project needing a flavor of Art Nouveau. Printers will be pleased to complement their Auriol, Baldur, Cordova, and Metropolitan, or other Art Nouveau&#x2013;style typefaces with these unusual, long-forgotten ornaments.

Vollmann continues his hugely original fictional history of the clash of Indians and Europeans in the New World. It is 400 years ago, and the Black Gowns, French Jesuit priests, are beginning their descent into the forests of Canada, eagerly seeking to convert the Huron--and courting martyrdom at the hands of the rival Iroquois. Through the eyes of these vastly different peoples--particularly through those of the grimly pious Father Jean de Brebeuf and the Indian prophetess Born Underwater--Vollmann reconstructs America's past as tragedy, nightmare, and bloody spectacle. In the process, he does nothing less than reinvent the American novel as well.</p><p>William T. Vollmann is the author of ten novels, including <i>Europe Central</i>, which won the National Book Award.&nbsp; He has also written four collections of stories, including <i>The</i> <i>Atlas</i>, which won the PEN Center USA West Award for Fiction, a memoir, and six works of nonfiction, including <i>Rising Up and Rising Down</i> and <i>Imperial</i>, both of which were finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award. He is the recipient of a Whiting Writers Award and the Strauss Living Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.&nbsp; His journalism and fiction have been published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Harpers</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Granta</i>, and many other publications.Idiosyncratic, inspired, and convoluted as ever, Vollmann offers the second installment in his seven-part series (Seven Dreams), moving from the Vikings and Vinland of The Ice-Shirt (1990) to the French and their impact on native populations in and around Quebec in the first half of the 17th century. Taking the Iroquois Saint Catherine Tekakwitha (1656-80) as a point of departure, Vollmann launches himself into a turbulent mytho-historico-geographical ``Stream of Time''--which in this case swirls and eddies first around the adventures of Samuel de Champlain, his comings and goings in New France, and his indefatigable efforts to map the unfamiliar territory for his own edification as much as for posterity. Always suspicious of the ``savages,'' meticulous in protecting the property of those chartered to reap the beaver harvest and other riches of the region while eager to gain his share, courageous and feared to the end, Champlain emerges as a man frequently at odds with circumstance but oddly worthy of his legendary status. The man of action gives way to men of the cloth in the latter half, as the Jesuits outmaneuver all opposition on a zealous mission of God to convert the Huron Nation or die trying. Advancing beyond the tentative fringes of French settlement along the St. Lawrence River, they seem to be the black-gowned harbingers of death when one plague after another decimates Huron villages. Happy to baptize the dead and the dying, they are resisted by shamans who have no power to halt either them or their diseases, but the ferocious Iroquois, traditional Huron enemies, are on hand to deliver the coup de grace. Jesuit martyrs are among the victims as the Huron cease to exist as a people but- -like Vollmann's restless dream-vision of North America--they are unstoppable. Vast and vivid as Canada itself, mingling the cold, deep waters of history with the present, and quixotic and ironic to its core. An immensely rewarding saga. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

And if one of Martin Beck&#39;s colleagues hadn&#39;t been on the scene, the explosion would have led to a major catastrophe because somehow a regulation fire-truck has vanished. Was it terrorism, suicide, or simply a gas leak? And what if, anything, did the explosion have to do with the peculiar death earlier that day of a 46-year-old bachelor whose cryptic suicide note consisted of only two words: &#34;Martin Beck&#34;?</p><p>Maj Sj�wall and Per Wahl��, her husband and coauthor, wrote ten Martin Beck mysteries. Mr Wahl��, who died in 1975, was a reporter for several Swedish newspapers and magazines and wrote numerous radio and television plays, film scripts, short stories, and novels. Maj Sj�wall is also a poet.1The man lying dead on the tidily made bed had first taken off his jacket and tie and hung them over the chair by the door. He had then unlaced his shoes, placed them under the chair and stuck his feet into a pair of black leather slippers. He had smoked three filter-tipped cigarettes and stubbed them out in the ashtray on the bedside table. Then he had lain down on his back on the bed and shot himself through the mouth.That did not look quite so tidy.His nearest neighbor was a prematurely retired army captain who had been injured in the hip during an elk hunt the previous year. He had suffered from insomnia after the accident and often sat up at night playing solitaire. He was just getting the deck of cards out when he heard the shot on the other side of the wall and he at once called the police.It was twenty to four on the morning of the seventh of March when two radio police broke the lock on the door and made their way into the apartment, inside which the man on the bed had been dead for thirty-two minutes. It did not take them long to establish the fact that the man almost certainly had committed suicide. Before returning to their car to report the death over the radio, they looked around the apartment, which in fact they should not have done. Apart from the bedroom, it consisted of a living room, kitchen, hall, bathroom and wardrobe. They could find no message or farewell letter. The only written matter visible was two words on the pad by the telephone in the living room. The two words formed a name. A name which both policemen knew well.Martin Beck.It was Ottilia&#39;s name day.Soon after eleven in the morning, Martin Beck left the South police station and went and stood in the line at the state liquor store in Karusellpian. He bought a bottle of Nutty Solera. On the way to the subway, he also bought a dozen red tulips and a can of English cheese biscuits. One of the six names his mother had been given at baptism was Ottilia and he was going out to congratulate her on her name day.The old people&#39;s home was large and very old. Much too old and inconvenient according to those who had to work there. Martin Beck&#39;s mother had moved there a year ago, not because she had been unable to manage on her own, for she was still lively and relatively fit at seventy-eight, but because she had not wanted to be a burden on her only child. So in good time she had ensured herself a place in the home and when a desirable room had become vacant, that is, when the previous occupant had died, she had got rid of most of her belongings and moved there. Since his father&#39;s death nineteen years earlier, Martin Beck had been her only support and now and again he was afflicted with pangs of conscience over not looking after her himself. Deep down, inwardly, he was grateful that she had taken things into her own hands without even asking his advice.He walked past one of the dreary small sitting rooms in which he had never seen anyone sitting, continued along the gloomy corridor and knocked on his mother&#39;s door. She looked up in surprise as he came in; she was a little deaf and had not heard his discreet tap. Her face lighting up, she put aside her book and began to get up. Martin Beck moved swiftly over to her, kissed her cheek and with gentle force pressed her down into the chair again.&#34;Don&#39;t start dashing about for my sake,&#34; he said.He laid the flowers on her lap and placed the bottle and can of biscuits on the table.&#34;Congratulations, Mother dear.&#34;She unwound the paper from the flowers and said:&#34;Oh, what lovely flowers. And biscuits! And wine, or what is it? Oh, sherry. Good gracious!&#34;She got up and, despite Martin Beck&#39;s protests, went over to a cupboard and took out a silver vase, which she filled with water from the washbasin.&#34;I&#39;m not so old and decrepit that I can&#39;t even use my legs,&#34; she said. &#34;Sit yourself down instead. Shall we have sherry or coffee?&#34;He hung up his hat and coat and sat down.&#34;Whichever you like,&#34; he said.&#34;Then I&#39;ll make coffee,&#34; she said. &#34;Then I can save the sherry and offer some to the old ladies and boast about my nice son. One has to save up the cheerful subjects.&#34;Martin Beck sat in silence, watching as she switched on the electric hotplate and measured out the water and coffee. She was small and fragile and seemed to grow smaller each time he saw her.&#34;Is it boring for you here, Mother?&#34;&#34;Me? I&#39;m never bored.&#34;The reply came much too quickly and glibly for him to believe her. Before sitting down, she put the coffee pot on the hotplate and the vase of flowers on the table.&#34;Don&#39;t you worry about me,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;ve got such a lot to do. I read and talk to the other old girls, and I knit. Sometimes I go into town and just look, though it&#39;s awful the way they&#39;re pulling everything down. Did you see that the building your father&#39;s business was in has been demolished?&#34;Martin Beck nodded. His father had had a small transport business in Klara and where it had once been, there was now a shopping center of glass and concrete. He looked at the photograph of his father that stood on the chest of drawers by her bed. The picture had been taken in the mid-twenties, when he himself had been only a few years old and his father had still been a young man with clear eyes, glossy hair with a side-part, and a stubborn chin. It was said that Martin Beck resembled his father. He himself had never been able to see the likeness, and should there be any, then it was limited to physical appearance. He remembered his father as a straightforward, cheerful man who was generally liked and who laughed and joked easily. Martin Beck would have described himself as a shy and rather dull person. At the time the photograph had been taken, his father had been a construction worker, but a few years later the depression came and he was unemployed for a couple of years. Martin Beck reckoned that his mother had never really got over those years of poverty and anxiety; although they were much better off later on, she had never stopped worrying about money. She still could not bring herself to buy anything new if it were not absolutely necessary, and both her clothes and the few bits of furniture she had brought with her from her old home were worn by the years.Martin Beck tried to give her money now and again and at regular intervals he offered to pay the bill at the home, but she was proud and obstinate and wished to be independent.When the coffee had boiled, he brought the pot over and let his mother pour it. She had always been solicitous toward her son and when he had been a boy she had never even allowed him to help with the dishes or make his own bed. He had not realized how misdirected her thoughtfulness had been until he had discovered how clumsy he was when it came to the simplest domestic chore.Martin Beck watched his mother with amusement as she popped a sugar lump into her mouth before taking a sip of the coffee. He had never seen her drinking coffee &#34;on the lump&#34; before. She caught his eye and she said:&#34;Ah well, you can take a few liberties when you&#39;re as old as I am.&#34;She put down her cup and leaned back, her thin freckled hands loosely clasped in her lap.&#34;Well,&#34; she said. &#34;Tell me how things are with my grandchildren.&#34;Nowadays, Martin Beck was always careful to express himself in nothing but positive terms when he talked to his mother about his children, as she considered her grandchildren cleverer, more brilliant and more beautiful than any other children. She often complained that he did not appreciate their merits and she had even accused him of being an unsympathetic and harsh father. He himself thought he was able to regard his children in a quite sober light and he presumed they were much like any other children. His contact with sixteen-year-old Ingrid was best, a lively, intelligent girl who found things easy at school and was a good mixer. Rolf would soon be thirteen and was more of a problem. He was lazy and introverted, totally uninterested in anything to do with school and did not seem to have any other special interests or talents either. Martin Beck was concerned about his son&#39;s inertia, but hoped it was just his age and that the boy would overcome his lethargy. As he could not find anything positive to say about RoIf at the moment and as his mother would not have believed him if he had told her the truth, he avoided the subject. When he had told her about Ingrid&#39;s latest progress at school, his mother said quite unexpectedly:&#34;Rolf&#39;s not going into the police force when he leaves school, is he?&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t think so. Anyhow, he&#39;s hardly thirteen. It&#39;s a little soon to begin worrying about that sort of thing.&#34;&#34;Because if he wants to, you must stop him,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;ve never understood why you were so stubborn about becoming a policeman. Nowadays it must be an even more awful profession than it was when you first began. Why did you join the police force, anyway, Martin?&#34;Martin Beck stared at her in astonishment. It was true she had been against his choice of profession at the time, twenty-four years ago, but it surprised him that she brought the subject up now. He had become a Chief Inspector in the Homicide Squad less than a year ago and his conditions of work were completely different from those that had existed when he had been a young patrolman.He leaned forward and patted her hand.&#34;I am all right now, Mother,&#34; he said. &#34;Nowadays, I mostly sit at a desk. But of course, I&#39;ve often asked myself the same question.&#34;It was true. He had often asked himself why he had become a policeman.Naturally he could have replied that at the time, during the war years, it was a good way of avoiding military service. After a two-year deferment because of bad lungs, he had been declared fit and no longer exempt, which was quite an important reason. In 1944 conscientious objectors were not tolerated. Many of those who had evaded military service in the way he had, had since changed occupation, but he himself had been promoted over the years to Chief Inspector. That ought to mean that he was a good policeman, but he was not so sure. There were several instances of senior posts in the police being held by less good policemen. He was not even certain he wanted to be a good policeman, if that involved being a dutiful person who never deviated one iota from the regulations. He remembered something Lennart Kollberg had once said a long time ago. &#34;There are lots of good cops around. Dumb guys who are good cops. Inflexible, limited, tough, self-satisfied types who are all good cops. It would be better if there were a few more good guys who were cops.&#34;His mother came out with him, and they walked together in the park a bit. The slushy snow made it difficult to walk and the icy wind rattled round the branches of the tall bare trees. After they had slipped about for ten minutes, he accompanied her back to the porch and kissed her on the cheek. He turned around on his way down the slope and saw her standing there waving by the entrance. Small and shrunken and gray.He took the subway back to the South police station in Vastberga Alle.On the way to his office, he glanced into Kollberg&#39;s room. Kollberg was an Inspector as well as Martin Beck&#39;s assistant and best friend. The room was empty. He glanced at his wristwatch. It was half-past one. It was Thursday. It required no profound thoughts to know where Kollberg was. For a brief moment Martin Beck even considered joining him down there with his pea soup, but then he thought of his stomach and desisted. It was already disturbed by the far too numerous cups of coffee his mother had pressed on him.On his blotter there was a brief message about the man who had committed suicide that same morning.His name was Ernst Sigurd Karlsson and he was forty-six years old. He was unmarried and his nearest relative was an elderly aunt in Boras. He had been absent from his work in an insurance company since Monday. Influenza. According to his colleagues at work, he was a loner and as far as they knew he had no close friends. His neighbors said he was quiet and inoffensive, came and went at definite times and seldom had visitors. Tests on his handwriting showed that it had indeed been he who had written Martin Beck&#39;s name on the telephone pad. That he had committed suicide was perfectly evident.There was nothing else to say about the case. Ernst Sigurd Karlsson had taken his own life, and as suicide is not a crime in Sweden, the police could not do very much more. All the questions had been answered. Except one. Whoever had written out the report had also asked this question: Had Chief Inspector Beck hadany connection with the man in question and could he possibly add anything?Martin Beck could not.He had never before heard of Ernst Sigurd Karlsson.</p><h2>Problems and Solutions in Introductory Mechanics</h2><p>This problem book is ideal for high-school and college students in search of practice problems with detailed solutions. All of the standard introductory topics in mechanics are covered: kinematics, Newton&#x2019;s laws, energy, momentum, angular momentum, oscillations, gravity, and fictitious forces. The introduction to each chapter provides an overview of the relevant concepts. Students can then warm up with a series of multiple-choice questions before diving into the free-response problems which constitute the bulk of the book. The first few problems in each chapter are derivations of key results/theorems that are useful when solving other problems. While the book is calculus-based, it can also easily be used in algebra-based courses. The problems that require calculus (only a sixth of the total number) are listed in an appendix, allowing students to steer clear of those if they wish. Additional details: (1) Features 150 multiple-choice questions and nearly 250 free-response problems, all with detailed solutions. (2) Includes 350 figures to help students visualize important concepts. (3) Builds on solutions by frequently including extensions/variations and additional remarks. (4) Begins with a chapter devoted to problem-solving strategies in physics. (5) A valuable supplement to the assigned textbook in any introductory mechanics course.</p><p>David Morin is a Lecturer and the Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Physics Department at Harvard University.

Maybe she is; maybe she isn't. I don't know. I do know that this first novel arrives with a voice that is fully formed: mature, hilarious, terrifyingly intelligent, and wicked. The novel is about a bird-loving American couple that moves to Europe and becomes, basically, eco-terrorists. This is strange, and interesting, but in between is some writing about marriage, love, fidelity, Europe, and saving the earth that is as funny and as grown-up as anything I've read in years. And there are some jokes in here that a young Don DeLillo would kill to have written. I hope he doesn't kill Nell Zink."&#x2014;Keith Gessen<br> <br> "Nell Zink is a writer of extraordinary talent and range. Her work insistently raises the possibility that the world is larger and stranger than the world you think you know.

Now his future lies in a potentially profitable marijuana patch hidden in the lush old-growth redwoods on the family land. Nelson has some serious problems. His marriage has fallen apart, and he may lose his land, cash and crop in the divorce. What's more, in need of some quick cash, he had foolishly agreed to smuggle $90,000 worth of cocaine through customs for Harry Lally, a major player in a drug syndicate. Chickening out just before bringing the drugs through, he flushed the powder. Now Lally wants him dead, and two goons are hot on his trail. Desperate, terrified and alone, for Nelson, there may be only one way out. <p> This is Denis Johnson's biggest and most complex book to date, and it perfectly showcases his signature themes of fate, redemption and the unraveling of the fabric of today's society. <i>Already Dead,</i> with its masterful narrative of overlapping and entwined stories, will further fuel the acclaim that surrounds one of today's most fascinating writers.</p></p><p>Denis Johnson is the author of <em>The Name of the World, Already Dead, Jesus' Son, Resuscitation of a Hanged Man, Fiskadoro, The Stars at Noon,</em> and <em>Angels.</em> His poetry has been collected in the volume <em>The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium General Assembly.</em> He is the recipient of a Lannan Fellowship and a Whiting Writer's Award, among many other honors for his work. He lives in northern Idaho.A kinky jeremiad about drug culture burnout (and fallout), powered by amusingly feverish images of California-as-Armageddon, from the poet and author whose recent fiction includes Jesus' Son (1992) and Resuscitation of a Hanged Man (1991). Johnson's latest is composed of a series of linked narratives set along the northern California coast in 199091, and centered in the psychic unraveling of Nelson Fairchild, a 30ish rich boy marijuana-grower who has unwisely cheated a murderous colleague, and spends his generally stoned, panicked days simultaneously fleeing the hit men who pursue him and arranging his own hit on his wife (who controls their finances, and in any case has been supplanted in Nelson's lustful affections by his mistress Melissa). Johnson surrounds Nelson's ordeal with a garish jumble of variously related outlaws and misfits, including Carl Van Ness, a philosophical drifter who vacillates between the consolations promised by suicide (Johnson's title denotes Van Ness's passive mind-set) and the intriguing prospect of becoming Nelson's hired gun; Wilhelm Frankheimer, a gigantic acidhead merchant marine turned blacksmith; Nelson's gently delirious brother William, who lives in the woods and writes deranged letters filled with cosmic paranoia to the police; a cop named Navarro who's drawn into their increasingly bizarre dance of death; and several alternately lissome and lethal women who, when not fulfilling their men's erotic fantasies, are blithely double-crossing them. There's also an effective Grand Guignol appearance by Nelson Fairchild p&#x160;re, the kind of venomous old man whom John Huston always played in movies. The book does move right along, despite its bulk, and the writing is frequently charged with energy and wit. But it contains a little too much of everything: fashionable despair (though Nelson's imagined ``demon'' has a gritty surrealism), New Age meandering, and fitful little explosions of overcalculated violence. A novel this one resembles, Charlie Smith's The Lives of the Dead, did it better. Johnson's attempt at a noir epic intermittently excites and teases, but doesn't satisfy. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Written in the summer of 2013,&nbsp;<i>Inside the Now</i>&nbsp;contains the most recent, never before published commentaries and reflections of Thich Nhat Hanh on living in stillness and timelessness. <br><br>The book begins with an autobiographical reflection in which we hear the voice of the young monk, poet, and community-builder struggling in war-torn Vietnam to develop a Buddhism relevant to the suffering of his time. These early experiences lay the groundwork for Thich Nhat Hanh's insights into the nature of time and interbeing. <br><br>In part two, we hear the clear, direct voice of the Zen Master challenging us to open our hearts, seize the moment, and touch the now. The book is interspersed&nbsp;with poetry from other Zen masters as well as the author's own verse and calligraphy.</p><p>Thich Nhat Hanh is one of the most revered Zen teachers in the world today. His best-selling books include <i>Happiness</i> and <i>Peace Is Every Step</i>. He lives in Plum Village in southwest France, where he gardens, writes, and teaches the art of mindful living.Thich Nhat Hanh shows us the connection between personal inner peace and peace on Earth.&#x201d; His Holiness The Dalai Lama<br><br> Beneath Thich Nhat Hanh&#x2019;s serene demeanor lies a courageous warrior.&#x201d; Oprah Winfrey<br></p><h2>The Motive (Dismas Hardy)</h2><p>With their park view and old-fashioned detail, the Victorian houses on San Francisco's Steiner Street were highly valuable. But with their wooden construction, they were also&nbsp; highly vulnerable. So when Paul Hanover's multimillion-dollar home went up in flames, it was all over very quickly. And when the bodies of Hanover and his girlfriend were found in the charred debris, it appeared that the end came even more quickly for them-judging from the bullet holes in their heads. But this isn't just any double homicide. Hanover was a friend-and donor-to the mayor, who wants answers. And in trying to provide them, Abe Glitsky and Dismas Hardy will face an old lover and an old enemy-and follow a trail of evidence that stretches far beyond their usual jurisdiction.</p><p>John Lescroart is the author of nineteen previous novels, including <i>The Betrayal, The Suspect, The Hunt Club, The Motive, The Second Chair, The First Law, The Oath, The Hearing</i>, and <i>Nothing But the Truth</i>. He lives in Northern California.<p> </p>In this police procedural, series characters Dismas Hardy and Abe Glitzky become involved in a case of double murder and arson. Overall, the story suffers from bloat, smart characters who act stupidly at the author's convenience, and an unconvincing ending. But clever characterizations and a solid mystery prevail, and the skilled and agile reading of David Colacci keeps it involving. While Colacci does not excel at distinctive characterizations, we always know who's who in each scene, and he makes up for any lack with an engaging voice and good pacing.

Savage brings to life the sensational story of the meteoric rise and rapid implosion of the Pistols through layers of rich detail, exclusive interviews, and rare photographs. This fully revised and updated edition of the book covers the legacy of punk twenty-five years later and provides an account of the Pistols' 1996 reunion as well as a freshly updated discography and a completely new introduction.</p></p><p><p><b>Jon Savage</b> began writing about music in 1977 and has covered the music scene for U.S. and international publications ever since. His books include<i> The Kinks: The Official Biography</i> and<i> Time Travel</i>, a collection of articles. He lives in West London.</p>In an account packed with incisive social analysis, a London- based writer who contributes regularly to US music magazines (Spin, Rolling Stone, etc.) chronicles the lurid yet surprisingly complex rise and fall of Britain's quintessential punk band, the Sex Pistols. Taking his title from the lyrics of the band's ``God Save the Queen'' (``There is no future, in England's dreaming. No future for you, no future for me''), Savage begins with a long description of the nihilistic, in-your-face fashion world in which Malcolm McLaren, the group's manager, got his start. These first pages are decidedly slow, but they are the only slow ones in a long book that--among countless other things--describes McLaren's apparently seething, opportunistic ambition, and the ``miasma'' of violence that followed the Sex Pistols from an early, foulmouthed TV interview to a gruesome tour across America's South (recounted by Noel E. Monk and Jimmy Guterman in 12 Days on the Road, 1990) and the drug-induced death of bass player Sid Vicious. Throughout, Savage provides much intriguing background information, especially about the suffocating nature of recession-hit 1970's England, along with illuminating quotes from dozens of sources. His narrative is filled with pithy insights that keep their appropriate punch even when wallowing in verbosity (``The very English phlegm which had served as a powerful psychological metaphor for denial...was now, literally, expelled in torrents as...Punk audiences covered their object of desire with sheets of saliva''). Though at times overly detailed and wordy, still a compelling and intelligent narrative that's as much about the nature of anarchy as about the Sex Pistols and punk rock.

Curiosity and the legs of a cross-country runner propelled him daily from an unheated, seventh-floor walk-up garret near the Champs-Elys�es to the old Montmartre haunts of the doomed painter Modigliani, the tombs of P�re-Lachaise cemetery, the luxuriant alleys of the Luxembourg Gardens and the aristocratic �le Saint-Louis midstream in the Seine.<br>Downie wound up living in the chic Marais district, married to the Paris-born American photographer Alison Harris, an equally incurable walker and chronicler. Ten books and a quarter-century later, he still spends several hours every day rambling through Paris, and writing about the city he loves. &nbsp;An irreverent, witty romp featuring thirty-one short prose sketches of people, places and daily life, <i>Paris, </i>Paris<i>: Journey into the City of Light</i> ranges from the glamorous to the least-known corners and characters of the world&#x2019;s favorite city.&nbsp;<br><br>Photographs by Alison Harris.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I loved his collection of essays and anyone who&#x2019;s visited Paris in the past, or plans to visit in the future, will be equally charmed as well.&#x201d; &#x2014;David Lebovitz, author of<i> The Sweet Life in Paris</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;[A] quirky, personal, independent view of the city, its history and its people&#x201d;&#x2014;Mavis Gallant <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Gives fresh poetic insight into the city... a voyage into &#x2018;the bends and recesses, the jagged edges, the secret interiors&#x2019; [of Paris].&#x201d;&#x2014; Departures</p><p>In his introduction, David Downie provides a tantalizing foretaste of this engaging, critically acclaimed book. "Paris is the kind of city butterfly catchers have trouble netting, tacking down and studying," he assures readers. "Like all great cities and yet unlike any other, Paris is alive and fluttering, it changes with the light, buffeted by Seine-basin breezes. This place called Paris is at once the city of literature and film, an imagined land, a distant view through shifting, misty lenses, the leftover tang of Jean-Paul Sartre&#x2019;s cigarettes clinging to the mirrored walls of a Saint-Germain-des-Pres caf�, and the city where I and over two million others pay taxes, re-heel shoes, and shop for cabbages or cleaning fluids." Packed with detail, Downie&#x2019;s essays "evoke the soul and the substance of the city with a critic&#x2019;s intelligence and a lover&#x2019;s heart" (Donald George, Global Travel Editor, Lonely Planet). Celebrated travel writer Jan Morris seems to agree, calling Paris, Paris "Perhaps the most evocative American book about Paris since A Movable Feast." Readers expecting the usual puffery will be disappointed. As noted author John Baxter points out, "Lifting the curtain (in some cases before the people inside expect it) is very much what this book is about... The chic Place de Vosges, for instance. What&#x2019;s it really like to live in those 17th century h�tels particuli�rs and to look down on the caf�s under the colonnade where movie stars take coffee and fashion models prowl? Well, for some, not much fun, since many tenants inherited their homes generations back, and can&#x2019;t or won&#x2019;t renovate. Persuading one to invite him in, Downie describes being &#x2018;led from floor to sagging floor by the pavilion&#x2019;s unwashed, unshaved, ornery owner, who scowled out of the broken windowpanes and cursed his inheritance. You think it&#x2019;s beautiful, he shouted over and over, you like the view? I hate it here. I hate it!&#x2019;" Happily Downie&#x2019;s abiding love for the French capital wins out, despite the occasional tongue-in-cheek jab. "[He] lives in Paris, like wine in a glass," comments prize-winning short story writer Mavis Gallant, who has called Paris home since 1950. "Paris, Paris is his quirky, personal, independent view of the city, its history and its people. Residents will recognize a place they can vouch for and not the clich�s so frequently conjured up to match the legends. Visitors and newcomers are bound to find Paris, Paris reliable company as they discover the city&#x2019;s beauties and pleasures and its problems too." Paris, Paris is that rare object nowadays: a book of literate travel essays illustrated with striking B&amp;W photographs. Known for her photography work in the books of Sophia Loren, Marcella Hazan, Anne Willan and many other celebrities and cooks, Alison Harris is also a passionate chronicler in B&amp;W of Paris&#x2019; streets. As Diane Johnson sees it, "Paris must be the most photographed place in the world, from Doisneau to Cartier-Bresson. These beautiful studies by Alison Harris extend that literature with a powerful formal talent. Her camera&#x2019;s loving dissection of details that the busy traveler might not notice for himself, makes of this book a splendid object in itself, a sort of bibliophilic gem."I hope these quirky, independent, skeptical, irreverent essays avoid the trap of the traveling curmudgeon. "Perhaps because I came to Paris expecting no favors, with few illusions, and a generous dose of curiosity," I write in my introduction, "I have yet to feel the betrayal some visitors and transitory residents distill into vague resentment. Paris has no monopoly on grumpy waiters, horizontal pollution, or enraged drivers, nor, in my experience, do the elusive, mythical Parisians focus their supposed disdain on any one nationality. I&#x2019;ve been privileged to hunt for Paris in many places, with many people, including the occasional Parisian, for nearly twenty years, and these essays are part of my catch. My vision of the city still blurs from Paris to Paris in my daily pursuit of fluttering wings. Happily, I don&#x2019;t want to pin them down and anyway, Paris always manages to fly away." I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoyed researching and writing them, a labor of love that took me nearly 10 years.</p><h2>Spit and Passion (Blindspot Graphics)</h2><p>At its core, <i>Spit and Passion</i> is about the transformative moment when music crashes into a stifling adolescent bedroom and saves you.

He just wasn&#x2019;t expecting it to run him over in an RV. Still, a punctured lung and broken ribs are nothing compared to the full-body shock he feels whenever he&#x2019;s near the vehicle&#x2019;s driver, Mary Winslow. He needs to keep her safe from their pursuers while he rescues his brother. Most challenging of all, he needs to claim this smart, stubborn woman as his life mate.</p><p>The naked, injured, insanely gorgeous younger man who clambered into her RV insists they belong together. If Mary wasn&#x2019;t feeling their incredible connection in every inch of her being, she wouldn&#x2019;t believe it. But now that the men who took Dante&#x2019;s twin are after her too, trusting her gut means risking her life for an immortal who&#x2019;s the very definition of a perfect stranger.</p></p><p><p>Lynsay Sands is the nationally bestselling author of the Argeneau/Rogue Hunter vampire series, as well as numerous historicals and anthologies. She&#x2019;s been writing since grade school and considers herself incredibly lucky to be able to make a career out of it.

Please visit her on the web at www.lynsaysands.net.</p>Sands&#39;s 23rd Argeneau paranormal romance (after About a Vampire) features a somewhat nontraditional heroine who meets her hero in an unusual way. With all of the spark of a low-speed chase in a traffic jam, 62-year-old widow Mary meets the younger-looking Dante when he comes bounding along through the woods like a deer in flight and runs into her RV on a lonely back road. Mary was taking one last trip to say goodbye to her husband&#39;s memory before returning to her beloved Canada. Dante&#39;s arrival does quite a bit to upend those plans. Unfortunately, Dante is a hunted man with a desperate need to find his twin brother, which means Mary&#39;s life isn&#39;t the only one changed by that chance meeting. The opening sets an unfortunately implausible tone for the remainder of the story, which focuses more on the interplay between Dante and Mary than any deeper plot. Readers who are excited to read paranormal romance with a senior citizen heroine will be disappointed when Mary is turned into a vampire and ends up looking like Barbie, and Sands never really makes her sound as mature as her age would imply. At its best, this installment has the feel of a transition book, paving the way for future stories wherein the deeper mystery alluded to will finally be addressed. Mostly, readers will suspect that Sands had a contract to fulfill. Agent: Jenny Bent, Bent Agency.

Useful for both practicing public executives and those who teach them, this book explicates some of the richest of several hundred cases used at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and illuminates their broader lessons for government managers. Moore addresses four questions that have long bedeviled public administration: What should citizens and their representatives expect and demand from public executives? What sources can public managers consult to learn what is valuable for them to produce? How should public managers cope with inconsistent and fickle political mandates? How can public managers find room to innovate?</p><p>Moore's answers respond to the well-understood difficulties of managing public enterprises in modern society by recommending specific, concrete changes in the practices of individual public managers: how they envision what is valuable to produce, how they engage their political overseers, and how they deliver services and fulfill obligations to clients. Following Moore's cases, we witness dilemmas faced by a cross section of public managers--William Ruckelshaus and the Environmental Protection Agency, Jerome Miller and the Department of Youth Services, Miles Mahoney and the Park Plaza Redevelopment Project, David Sencer and the swine flu scare, Lee Brown and the Houston Police Department, Harry Spence and the Boston Housing Authority. Their work, together with Moore's analysis, reveals how public managers can achieve their true goal of producing public value.</p></p><p>A seminal figure in the field of public management, mark more presents his summation of fifteen years of research, observation, and teaching about what public-sector executives should do to improve the performance of public enterprises.Mark H.

Every concert-goer and lover of music will take keen pleasure in his notes about the essential features of music, the process of musical composition, inspiration, musical types, and musical execution. Throughout the volume are to he found trenchant comments on such subjects as Wagnerism, the operas of Verdi, musical taste, musical snobbery, the influence of political ideas on Russian music under the Soviets, musical improvisation as opposed to musical construction, the nature of melody, and the function of the critic of music. Musical people of every sort will welcome this first presentation in English of an unusually interesting book.</p><p>Text: English, French&#x201c;[These lessons] provide penetrating glimpses into the thought processes of Stravinsky's mind. While dealing with his chosen topics--the phenomenon of music, the composition of music, musical typology, the avatars of Russian music, and the performance of music--he reveals his reverence for tradition, order and discipline. He believes "the more art is controlled, limited, worked over, the more it is free." His opinions about Wagner, Verdi, Berlioz, Hindemith, Weber, Beethoven, Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Moussorgsky and Bach are refreshing. He also analyzes the function of the critic, the requirements of the interpreter, the state of Russian music, and musical taste and snobbery.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>The American Recorder</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Some good (and some specious) phrases from one of music's finest phrase-makers; a fascinating and sporadically valuable attempt to come to grips with the metaphysics of music; and a rich assortment of historical aper�us. More than that, it is, of course, an intimate profession of faith revealing the detailed ideological context of the music; it is also the source of that unforgettable advice to the violinists: "It is ill becoming when playing, to spread one's legs too far apart." During the academic year 1939-1940, Stravinsky delivered the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard. He spoke in French. An English translation appeared in 1947, and now this bilingual edition enables the reader to study both the language in which Stravinsky conceived his "lessons" and the excellent English translation...printed on the facing pages...The six lectures that make up <i>Poetics</i> take the form of an "explanation of music"...[The book] remains a quintessence of Stravinsky's reactions to the phenomenon of music. <i>Poetics of Music</i> offers the most coherent statement of the unchanging values behind Stravinsky's many apparent shifts of manner: his insistence, for example, that music should be a revelation of a higher order to be faithfully executed by the performer, rather than a medium of self-expression to be interpreted. Above all, the composer must submit to rules, no matter how arbitrary, for "the more constraints one imposes, the more one frees one's self of the chains that shackle the spirit."&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>G.

What he has left behind we don&#x2019;t yet know. What he faces is an existential battle with himself, the elements, and something he begins to see in the margins of his vision: some creature that is tracking him, the pursuit of which will become an obsession.</p><p>This short, shocking, and exhilarating novel is a vivid exploration of isolation, courage, and the search for truth that continues the story set one thousand years earlier in Paul Kingsnorth&#x2019;s bravura debut novel, <i>The Wake</i>. It extends that book&#x2019;s promise and confirms Kingsnorth as one of our most daring and rewarding contemporary writers.</p></p><p><b>Paul Kingsnorth</b> is the author of <i>The Wake </i>and <i>Confessions of a Recovering Environmentalist</i>. He is cofounder of the Dark Mountain Project, a global network of writers, artists, and thinkers in search of new stories for a world on the brink.<p>&#x201c;<i>Beast</i> cements Kingsnorth&#x2019;s reputation as a furiously gifted writer. . . . Like the huge creature that haunts its pages, <i>Beast</i> has an uncanny power. . . . With its echoes of Kafka and of dread-filled, myth-driven tales like John Gardner&#x2019;s <i>Grendel</i>, Kingsnorth&#x2019;s <i>Beast </i>is as cryptic as it is thrilling.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>The Washington Post</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Wild and spectacular.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>The Boston Globe</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;[Written] with unnerving smoothness and lyricism. . . .

It leads readers away from optimism and realism alike, deeper into a new scrutiny of the stories by which we try to make our way.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;On its own, [<i>Beast</i>] is a taut, thrilling and mystifying narrative.

Now Horn's identity has become ambiguous, a complex question embedded in the story, whose telling is itself complex, shifting from place to place, present to past. Horn recalls visiting the Whorl, the enormous spacecraft in orbit that brought the settlers from Urth, and going thence to the planet Green, home of the blood-drinking alien inhumi. There, he led a band of mercenary soldiers, answered to the name of Rajan, and later became the ruler of a city state. He has also encountered the mysterious aliens, the Neighbors, who once inhabited both Blue and Green. He remembers a visit to Nessus, on Urth. At some point, he died. His personality now seemingly inhabits a different body, so that even his sons do not recognize him. And people mistake him for Silk, to whom he now bears a remarkable resemblance. </p><p><i>In Green's Jungles</i> is Wolfe's major new fiction, <i>The Book of the Short Sun</i>, building toward a strange and seductive climax.</p><p>"Wolfe's narrative glows, rich and seductive as ever."--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><p>Gene Wolfe has stymied and delighted smart science fiction readers for years. His complex, multilayered narratives, untrustworthy narrators, and puzzle-box characters send those of us who like that sort of thing into paroxysms of thrilling speculation, re-reading, and just plain guessing what it all means. <i>In Green's Jungles</i> is the middle book of Wolfe's opus trilogy, The Book of the Short Sun (the first is <i>On Blue's Waters</i>). It is by no means necessary to start with his other series, The Book of the New Sun and The Book of the Long Sun, in order to enjoy what is most likely the final examination of the universe Wolfe has created. But critics and fans are mostly in agreement that they are best read in order, and that the Short Sun series is the best of an astonishing bunch.<p> <i>In Green's Jungles</i> follows narrator Horn as he voyages to the planet Green (Blue's companion) and to the abandoned generational starship known as the Whorl in search of the godlike Patera Silk. As Horn recounts his adventures, his own identity becomes muddled, and we find out his interactions with the vampiric inhumi of Green and the strange alien Neighbors were deeper than we knew. In fact, Horn may not be himself at all anymore. Tantalizing story details drip slowly from Wolfe's pen:</p><p> </p><blockquote>Through the ring a Neighbor saw him, and she came to him in his agony.... she said, "I cannot make you well again, and if I could you would still be in this place. I can do this for you, however, if you desire it. I can send your spirit into someone else, into someone whose own spirit is dying."</blockquote><p> So who is Horn? Has he become Patera Silk--it seems so, for people begin mistaking him for the heroic leader.

For people who live here today, just as for those Native Americans and European settlers who preceded us, this dramatic natural landform is a source of awe. Since the 1860s it has inspired superb photographers who have framed and interpreted the way we see the Gorge, and who have in turn had their artistic vision shaped by this compelling landscape. The ninety-year period covered in Wild Beauty was a critical one in the river&#x2019;s history. Over thousands of years the wild, free-flowing torrent of the Columbia River carved a passage&#x2014;the Columbia River Gorge&#x2014;through the Cascade Mountain Range. In the 1860s, when the first photographers arrived, the Gorge still looked much the same as it had when Lewis and Clark made their way down the river in 1805, and indeed as it had for centuries before that, when the native peoples&#x2019; culture of fishing and trade thrived along the river&#x2019;s banks. In the mid-twentieth century, the character of the river was fundamentally altered by the construction of hydroelectric dams. Terry Toedtemeier and John Laursen have selected more than 130 images&#x2014;most of them previously unpublished and many of them never before available for public view&#x2014;by some three dozen photographers to chronicle the history of photography in the Gorge. Wild Beauty begins in 1867 with images by the legendary Carleton Watkins, creator of some of the greatest landscape photographs of the nineteenth century. Later photographers include Benjamin Gifford, Lily White, Sarah Ladd, Fred Kizer, Alfred Monner, and Ray Atkeson. The volume ends in 1957 with the completion of The Dalles Dam, which drowned Celilo Falls and with it the historic site where Indians had fished for millennia.The images in this beautifully designed volume are presented one to a spread, with captions on the facing pages. The book is organized into five chronological sections, each with a brief introduction; a map shows the locations where the photographs were made. The photographs have been meticulously restored and are exquisitely reproduced in four-color process to capture the subtle coloration and nuanced tonal values of albumen prints, gelatin silver prints, platinum prints, hand-colored photographs, and early Kodachromes.The photography of Watkins and his successors is a significant piece of the cultural heritage of the Pacific Northwest. Readers interested in the history of the Columbia River and the photography of the developing American West will be enthralled by the book&#x2019;s scope and artistry. And those who love the Gorge&#x2019;s stunning beauty will welcome how this volume has captured its grandeur.Wild Beauty represents, in the words of one reviewer, &#x201c;a culmination of decades of research, exhibition, and total immersion in the geology, history, and photography of the Columbia River Gorge.&#x201d; Oregon State University Press is proud to partner with the Northwest Photography Archive to publish this remarkable volume.</p><p>In the 1860s, when the first photographers arrived, the Columbia River Gorge still looked much the same as it had when Lewis and Clark made their way down the river in 1805.

In fact, "it is only when Good Friday comes, and you have hot cross buns for tea, that you know for certain Easter will be the day after tomorrow." A little girl prepares for Easter by asking the chickens to lay her plenty of Easter eggs and dreaming "the loveliest dreams" of a wee fawn that makes her light as thistledown and takes her on a journey past shiny-coated rabbits, lambs frolicking among buttercups, and stardusted daffodils.<p> Beloved artist Tasha Tudor, creator of the Caldecott Honor book <i>1 Is One</i> and more than 90 other picture books, looks through the eyes of a child at a favorite springtime holiday. With her trademark delicate watercolors and honey-sweet text, Tudor revisits her childhood memories and dreams of Easter.

Busy executives expect you to respect and manage their time more effectively than ever. You need to do the groundwork to make your message tight and to the point. The average professional receives 304 emails per week and checks their smartphones 36 times an hour and 38 hours a week. This inattention has spread to every part of life. The average attention span has shrunk from 12 seconds in 2000 to eight in 2012.</p> <p>So, throw them a lifeline and be brief.</p> <p>Author Joe McCormack tackles the challenges of inattention, interruptions, and impatience that every professional faces. His proven B.R.I.E.F. approach, which stands for Background, Relevance, Information, Ending, and Follow up, helps simplify and clarify complex communication.&nbsp;<i>BRIEF</i>&nbsp;will help you summarize lengthy information, tell a short story, harness the power of infographics and videos, and turn monologue presentations into controlled conversations.</p> <ul> <li>Details the B.R.I.E.F. approach to distilling your message into a brief presentation</li> <li>Written by the founder and CEO of Sheffield Marketing Partners, which specializes in message and narrative development, who is also a recognized expert in Narrative Mapping, a technique that helps clients achieve a clearer and more concise message</li> </ul> Long story short:&nbsp;<i>BRIEF</i>&nbsp;will help you gain the muscle you need to eliminate wasteful words and stand out from the rest.

That&#x2019;s an inexcusable waste of everyone&#x2019;s time and resources. <i>Brief</i> isn&#x2019;t a nicety, it&#x2019;s a necessity. In a world where we are inundated with information and highly inattentive, we have very small windows of time to make an impact with no margin for error. The problem is most people don&#x2019;t have the know-how or verbal discipline to do the upfront groundwork and get to the point. As a result, they waste precious opportunities with decision-makers, and get too &#x201c;comfortable&#x201d; and verbally sloppy with co-workers and long-time clients. <i>Brief</i> is a step-by-step approach to getting to the point quickly and ensuring that your message is delivered with maximum impact.</p> <p>With real-world case studies and illustrative examples of messaging successes &#x2013; and failures &#x2013; author and senior marketing executive Joseph McCormack provides an easy-to-follow framework for communicating more effectively and efficiently.

You&#x2019;ll learn to trim your ideas for your intended audience and to communicate in the most appropriate timeframe for each situation. As attention spans get shorter and decision-makers have less time to absorb your ideas and presentations, it is imperative that you craft your message carefully, the first time, and tailor it specifically to your target.</p> <p>Written for business executives, sales and marketing professionals, entrepreneurs, and anyone who aspires to be a lean communicator, <i>Brief: Make a Bigger Impact by Saying Less</i> provides the tools you&#x2019;ll need to be tight and get it right.</p><p><b>What people are saying about brevity.</b></p> <p>&#x201c;I get several hundred emails per day.

We are told that whether a picture, a movement, a text, or sound qualifies as a "work of art" largely depends on social attitudes and convention. Drawing on examples ranging from Paleolithic cave paintings to modern pop music and building on the ideas of James Joyce, Oscar Wilde, Gilles Deleuze, Carl Jung, and others, J.F. Martel argues that art is an inborn human phenomenon that precedes the formation of culture and even society. Art is free of politics and ideology. Paradoxically, that is what makes it a force of liberation wherever it breaks through the trance of humdrum existence. Like the act of dreaming, artistic creation is fundamentally mysterious. It is a gift from beyond the field of the human, and it connects us with realities that, though normally unseen, are crucial components of a living world.<br><br> While holding this to be true of authentic art, the author acknowledges the presence&#x2014;overwhelming in our media-saturated age&#x2014;of a false art that seeks not to liberate but to manipulate and control. Against this anti-artistic aesthetic force, which finds some of its most virulent manifestations in modern advertising, propaganda, and pornography, true art represents an effective line of defense. Martel argues that preserving artistic expression in the face of our contemporary hyper-aestheticism is essential to our own survival.<br><br> Art is more than mere ornament or entertainment; it is a way, one leading to what is most profound in us. <i>Reclaiming Art in the Age of Artifice</i> places art alongside languages and the biosphere as a thing endangered by the onslaught of predatory capitalism, spectacle culture, and myopic technological progress. The book is essential reading for visual artists, musicians, writers, actors, dancers, filmmakers, and poets. It will also interest anyone who has ever been deeply moved by a work of art, and for all who seek a way out of the web of deception and vampiric diversion that the current world order has woven around us.</p><p>J.F. MARTEL is a writer and award-winning filmmaker working in the Canadian film and television industry. In addition to making several short films, he has researched, written and/or directed a number of documentary programs on topics related to culture and the arts for major Francophone broadcasters, including La Port�e des mots (season two), a twelve-part documentary series exploring the transformative power of song with some of French Canada&#x2019;s great songwriters. <br> <br>Martel is a contributor to the web magazine <i>Reality Sandwich. </i>His essay on Stanley Kubrick was included in the first <i>Reality Sandwich</i> anthology, <i>Toward 2012: Perspectives on the Next Age</i> (Tarcher-Penguin), edited by Daniel Pinchbeck and Ken Jordan. His work will also appear in North Atlantic Books&#x2019;s forthcoming title <i>Pluto: Astronomy, Astrology, Mythology, </i>edited by Richard Grossinger.&#x201c;Leaping gracefully from Coleridge to Kubrick, from the Bible to Baudrillard, J.F. Martel offers us a lovely and powerful reminder that the greatest art presents the world through mystery rather than manipulation. Arguing that art's prophetic promise comes from its capacity to rupture the workaday world of means and ends, Martel calls for a visionary return to the imaginal rifts of a novelty beyond artifice.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Erik Davis, author of <i>TechGnosis</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A key work for the soul of our time, <i>Reclaiming Art in the Age of Artifice</i> is for the seasoned artist and the novice alike, for all those who dare to walk in, as J.F. Martel writes, an &#x2018;excess of meaning.&#x2019; We need those today who would dare to live this way, and this book is a resounding call to return to the Imaginal life. &#x2018;Sing in me muse,&#x2019; spoke Homer, and Martel has writ this large across the pages.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Jeremy D. Johnson, editor at <i>Reality Sandwich <br><br></i>&#x201c;J.F. Martel is an incisive cultural critic with a penetrating vision of art. His book is a quiet manifesto for the creative act, reminding us of the numinous quality of the aesthetic object, as well as the intrinsic strangeness of our lives in the world.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Daniel Pinchbeck, author of&nbsp;<i>Breaking Open the Head</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The complete colonization of the mind is the final frontier of capitalist domination. As Martel is aware, this domination proceeds, at ever-increasing speed, through the reduction of the imagination to that which can be predicted and controlled. Far from being merely the commodification of the aesthetic, this project is engineered to eliminate the ineffability and uniqueness of human existence, as such. This book is a beautifully written lament and a passionate, prophetic plea for what remains not only of art but also of humanity.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Joshua Ramey, associate professor, Grinnell College, and author of <i>The Hermetic Deleuze: Philosophy and Spiritual Ordeal</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;&#x2018;Art,&#x2019; J.F. Martel writes, &#x2018;astonishes and is born of astonishment.&#x2019; And that is the theme of this extraordinary book: that beauty is indispensable because it mounts a continual challenge against false views of reality. Drawing his examples from across cultures, history and genres, Martel celebrates mystery, the imagination&#x2014;and, above all, art&#x2019;s power to testify to the individual consciousness. An ambitious, exciting debut. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;James Arthur, assistant professor, Johns Hopkins University<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;<i>Reclaiming Art in the Age of Artifice</i> argues for the beauty of the transcendent experience of art in contrast to the jarring world of modern artifice. Moving confidently and effortlessly among films, literature, and paintings, J.F. Martel shows us&#x2014;in a carefully reasoned progression&#x2014;that all great art is ultimately rooted in the powerful mystery of life.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;David Staines, professor, University of Ottawa<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is a fascinating and invigorating book. In explaining art as a concrete expression of a mythic reality that is simultaneously beautiful, awesome, terrifying, numinous, and sublime, J.F. Martel fuses a high metaphysical and ontological vision with a rich sensibility that is equal parts mysticism and weird horror. What&#x2019;s more, he offers a dead-on diagnosis of our present cultural moment as an &#x2018;age of artifice&#x2019; in which political and commercial concerns have hijacked the power of art and forced it to serve the demons of hype and propaganda. I hope <i>Reclaiming Art in the Age of Artifice</i> reaches a large number of sympathetic readers, and that they will find its argument as resonant and inspiring as I do.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Matt Cardin, author of <i>Dark Awakenings</i> and <i>A Course in Demonic Creativity</i><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Here is a&nbsp;lucid and timely reminder&nbsp;of those&nbsp;things that so often seem to&nbsp;be forgotten in&nbsp;considerations of art, notably the absolute importance of beauty, of mystery, of depth. After decades of the cant and pretentiousness&#x2014;to say nothing of the triviality&#x2014;that&nbsp;has surrounded art, reading J.F. Martel&#x2019;s book was a serious wake-up call, as refreshing as a sudden access of deeply breathed, ozone-laden air.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Patrick Harpur, author of <i>The Secret Tradition of the Soul </i></p><h2>The Warded Man: Book One of The Demon Cycle</h2><p><b>The time has come to stand against the night.</b><br><br> As darkness falls each night, the corelings rise&#x2013;demons who well up from the ground like hellish steam, taking on fearsome form and substance.

Mist still clung to the air, bringing with it a damp, acrid taste that was all too familiar. A quiet dread built in his gut as he waited in the morning stillness, hoping that it had been his imagination. He was eleven years old.<br><br>There was a pause, and then the horn blew twice in rapid succession. One long and two short meant south and east. The Cluster by the Woods. His father had friends among the Cutters. Behind Arlen, the door to the house opened, and he knew his mother would be there, covering her mouth with both hands.<br><br>Arlen returned to his work, not needing to be told to hurry. Some chores could wait a day, but the stock still needed to be fed and the cows milked. He left the animals in the barns and opened the hay stores, slopped the pigs, and ran to fetch a wooden milk bucket. His mother was already squatting beneath the first of the cows. He snatched the spare stool and they found cadence in their work, the sound of milk striking wood drumming a funeral march.<br><br>As they moved to the next pair down the line, Arlen saw his father begin hitching their strongest horse, a five-year-old chestnut-colored mare named Missy, to the cart. His face was grim as he worked.<br><br>What would they find this time?<br><br>Before long, they were in the cart, trundling toward the small cluster of houses by the woods. It was dangerous there, over an hour&#x2019;s run to the nearest warded structure, but the lumber was needed. Arlen&#x2019;s mother, wrapped in her worn shawl, held him tightly as they rode.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a big boy, Mam,&#x201d; Arlen complained. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need you to hold me like a baby. I&#x2019;m not scared.&#x201d; It ?wasn&#x2019;t entirely true, but it would not do for the other children to see him clinging to his mother as they rode in. They made mock of him enough as it was.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m scared,&#x201d; his mother said. &#x201c;What if it&#x2019;s me who needs to be held?&#x201d;<br><br>Feeling suddenly proud, Arlen pulled close to his mother again as they traveled down the road. She could never fool him, but she always knew what to say just the same.<br><br>A pillar of greasy smoke told them more than they wanted to know long before they reached their destination. They were burning the dead. And starting the fires this early, without waiting for others to arrive and pray, meant there were a great many. Too many to pray over each one, if the work was to be complete before dusk.<br><br>It was more than five miles from Arlen&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s farm to the Cluster by the Woods. By the time they arrived, the few remaining cabin fires had been put out, though in truth there was little left to burn. Fifteen houses, all reduced to rubble and ash.<br><br>&#x201c;The woodpiles, too,&#x201d; Arlen&#x2019;s father said, spitting over the side of the cart. He gestured with his chin toward the blackened ruin that remained of a season&#x2019;s cutting. Arlen grimaced at the thought of how the rickety fence that penned the animals would have to last another year, and immediately felt guilty. It was only wood, after all.<br><br>The town Speaker approached their cart as it pulled up. Selia, whom Arlen&#x2019;s mother sometimes called Selia the Barren, was a hard woman, tall and thin, with skin like tough leather. Her long gray hair was pulled into a tight bun, and she wore her shawl like a badge of office. She brooked no nonsense, as Arlen had learned more than once at the end of her stick, but today he was comforted by her presence. Like Arlen&#x2019;s father, something about Selia made him feel safe. Though she had never had children of her own, Selia acted as a parent to everyone in Tibbet&#x2019;s Brook. Few could match her wisdom, and fewer still her stubbornness. When you were on Selia&#x2019;s good side, it felt like the safest place in the world.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s good that you&#x2019;ve come, Jeph,&#x201d; Selia told Arlen&#x2019;s father. &#x201c;Silvy and young Arlen, too,&#x201d; she said, nodding to them. &#x201c;We need every hand we can get. Even the boy can help.&#x201d;<br><br>Arlen&#x2019;s father grunted, stepping down from the cart. &#x201c;I brought my tools,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Just tell me where we can throw in.&#x201d;<br><br>Arlen collected the precious tools from the back of their cart. Metal was scarce in the Brook, and his father was proud of his two shovels, his pick and his saw. They would all see heavy use this day.<br><br>&#x201c;How many lost?&#x201d; Jeph asked, though he didn&#x2019;t really seem to want to know.<br><br>&#x201c;Twenty-seven,&#x201d; Selia said. Silvy choked and covered her mouth, tears welling in her eyes. Jeph spat again.<br><br>&#x201c;Any survivors?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;A few,&#x201d; Selia said. &#x201c;Manie&#x201d;&#x2014;she pointed with her stick at a boy who stood staring at the funeral pyre&#x2014;&#x201c;ran all the way to my house in the dark.&#x201d;<br><br>Silvy gasped. No one had ever run so far and lived. &#x201c;The wards on Brine Cutter&#x2019;s house held for most of the night,&#x201d; Selia went on. &#x201c;He and his family watched everything. A few others fled the corelings and succored there, until the fires spread and their roof caught. They waited in the burning house until the beams started to crack, and then took their chances outside in the minutes before dawn. The corelings killed Brine&#x2019;s wife Meena and their son Poul, but the others made it. The burns will heal and the children will be all right in time, but the others . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t need to finish the sentence. Survivors of a demon attack had a way of dying soon after. Not all, or even most, but enough. Some of them took their own lives, and others simply stared blankly, refusing to eat or drink until they wasted away. It was said you did not truly survive an attack until a year and a day had passed.<br><br>&#x201c;There are still a dozen unaccounted for,&#x201d; Selia said, but with little hope in her voice.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll dig them out,&#x201d; Jeph agreed grimly, looking at the collapsed houses, many still smoldering. The Cutters built their homes mostly out of stone to protect against fire, but even stone would burn if the wards failed and enough flame demons gathered in one place.<br><br>Jeph joined the other men and a few of the stronger women in clearing the rubble and carting the dead to the pyre. The bodies had to be burned, of course. No one would want to be buried in the same ground the demons rose out of each night. Tender Harral, the sleeves of his robe rolled up to bare his thick arms, lifted each into fire himself, muttering prayers and drawing wards in the air as the flames took them.<br><br>Silvy joined the other women in gathering the younger children and tending to the wounded under the watchful eye of the Brook&#x2019;s Herb Gatherer, Coline Trigg. But no herbs could ease the pain of the survivors. Brine Cutter, also called Brine Broadshoulders, was a great bear of a man with a booming laugh who used to throw Arlen into the air when they came to trade for wood. Now Brine sat in the ashes beside his ruined house, slowly knocking his head against the blackened wall. He muttered to himself and clutched his arms tightly, as if cold.<br><br>Arlen and the other children were put to work carrying water and sorting through the woodpiles for salvageable lumber. There were still a few warm months left to the year, but there would not be time to cut enough wood to last the winter. They would be burning dung again this year, and the house would reek.<br><br>Again Arlen weathered a wave of guilt. He was not in the pyre, nor banging his head in shock, having lost everything. There were worse fates than a house smelling of dung.<br><br>More and more villagers arrived as the morning wore on. Bringing their families and whatever provisions they could spare, they came from Fishing Hole and Town Square; they came from the Boggin&#x2019;s Hill, and Soggy Marsh. Some even came all the way from Southwatch. And one by one, Selia greeted them with the grim news and put them to work.<br><br>With more than a hundred hands, the men doubled their efforts, half of them continuing to dig as the others descended upon the only salvageable structure left in the Cluster: Brine Cutter&#x2019;s house. Selia led Brine away, somehow supporting the giant man as he stumbled, while the men cleared the rubble and began hauling new stones. A few took out warding kits and began to paint fresh wards while children made thatch. The house would be restored by nightfall.<br><br>Arlen was partnered with Cobie Fisher in hauling wood. The children had amassed a sizable pile, though it was only a fraction of what had been lost. Cobie was a tall, thickly built boy with dark curls and hairy arms. He was popular among the other children, but it was popularity built at others&#x2019; expense. Few children cared to weather his insults, and fewer still his beatings.<br><br>Cobie had tortured Arlen for years, and the other children had gone along. Jeph&#x2019;s farm was the northernmost in the Brook, far from where the children tended to gather in Town Square, and Arlen spent most of his free time wandering the Brook by himself. Sacrificing him to Cobie&#x2019;s wrath seemed a fair trade to most children.<br><br>Whenever Arlen went fishing, or passed by Fishing Hole on the way to Town Square, Cobie and his friends seemed to hear about it, and were waiting in the same spot on his way home. Sometimes they just called him names, or pushed him, but other times he came home bloody and bruised, and his mother shouted at him for fighting.<br><br>Finally, Arlen had enough. He left a stout stick hidden in that spot, and the next time Cobie and his friends pounced, Arlen pretended to run, only to produce the weapon as if from thin air and come back swinging.<br><br>Cobie was the first one struck, a hard blow that left him crying in the dirt with blood running from his ear. Willum received a broken finger, and Gart walked with a limp for over a week. It had done nothing to improve Arlen&#x2019;s popularity among the other children, and Arlen&#x2019;s father had caned him, but the other boys never bothered him again. Even now, Cobie gave him a wide berth and flinched if Arlen made a sudden move, even though he was bigger by far.<br><br>&#x201c;Survivors!&#x201d; Bil Baker called suddenly, standing by a collapsed house at the edge of the Cluster. &#x201c;I can hear them trapped in the root cellar!&#x201d;<br><br>Immediately, everyone dropped what they were doing and rushed over. Clearing the rubble would take too long, so the men began to dig, bending their backs with silent fervor. Soon after, they broke through the side of the cellar, and began hauling out the survivors. They were filthy and terrified, but all were very much alive. Three women, six children, and one man.<br><br>&#x201c;Uncle Cholie!&#x201d; Arlen cried, and his mother was there in an instant, cradling her brother, who stumbled drunkenly. Arlen ran to them, ducking under his other arm to steady him.<br><br>&#x201c;Cholie, what are you doing here?&#x201d; Silvy asked. Cholie seldom left his workshop in Town Square. Arlen&#x2019;s mother had told the tale a thousand times of how she and her brother had run the farrier&#x2019;s shop together before Jeph began breaking his horses&#x2019; shoes on purpose for a reason to come court.<br><br>&#x201c;Came to court Ana Cutter,&#x201d; Cholie mumbled. He pulled at his hair, having already torn whole clumps free. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d just opened the bolt-hole when they came through the wards . . .&#x201d; His knees buckled, pulling Arlen and Silvy down with his weight. Kneeling in the dirt, he wept.<br><br>Arlen looked at the other survivors. Ana Cutter wasn&#x2019;t among them. His throat tightened as the children passed. He knew every one of them; their families, what their houses were like inside and out, their animals&#x2019; names. They met his eyes for a second as they went by, and in that moment, he lived the attack through their eyes. He saw himself shoved into a cramped hole in the ground while those unable to fit turned to face the corelings and the fire. Suddenly he started gasping, unable to stop until Jeph slapped him on the back and brought him to his senses.<br><br>They were finishing a cold midday meal when a horn sounded on the far side of the Brook.<br><br>&#x201c;Not two in one day?&#x201d; Silvy gasped, covering her mouth.<br>&#x201c;Bah,&#x201d; Selia grunted. &#x201c;At midday? Use your head, girl!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then what...<br><br>Selia ignored her, rising to fetch a horn blower to signal back. Keven Marsh had his horn ready, as the folks from Soggy Marsh always did. It was easy to get separated in the marshes, and no one wanted to be wandering lost when the swamp demons rose. Keven&#x2019;s cheeks inflated like a frog&#x2019;s chin as he blew a series of notes.<br><br>&#x201c;Messenger horn,&#x201d; Coran Marsh advised Silvy. A graybeard, he was Speaker for Soggy Marsh and Keven&#x2019;s father. &#x201c;They prob&#x2019;ly saw the smoke. Keven&#x2019;s telling &#x2019;em what&#x2019;s happened and where everyone is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A Messenger in spring?&#x201d; Arlen asked. &#x201c;I thought they come in the fall after harvest. We only finished planting this past moon!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Messenger never came last fall,&#x201d; Coran said, spitting foamy brown juice from the root he was chewing through the gap of his missing teeth. &#x201c;We been worried sumpin&#x2019; happened. Thought we might not have a Messenger bring salt till next fall. Or maybe that the corelings got the Free Cities and we&#x2019;s cut off.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The corelings could never get the Free Cities,&#x201d; Arlen said.<br><br>&#x201c;Arlen, shush your mouth!&#x201d; Silvy hissed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s your elder!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let the boy speak,&#x201d; Coran said. &#x201c;Ever bin to a free city, boy?&#x201d; he asked Arlen.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Arlen admitted.<br><br>&#x201c;Ever know anyone who had?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Arlen said again.<br><br>&#x201c;So what makes you such an expert?&#x201d; Coran asked. &#x201c;Ent no one been to one &#x2019;cept the Messengers. They&#x2019;re the only ones what brave the night to go so far. Who&#x2019;s to say the Free Cities ent just places like the Brook? If the corelings can get us, they can get them, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Old Hog is from the Free Cities,&#x201d; Arlen said. Rusco Hog was the richest man in the Brook. He ran the general store, which was the crux of all commerce in Tibbet&#x2019;s Brook.<br>&#x201c;Ay,&#x201d; Coran said, &#x201c;an&#x2019; old Hog told me years ago that one trip was enough for him. He meant to go back after a few years, but said it wasn&#x2019;t worth the risk. So you ask him if the Free Cities are any safer than anywhere else.&#x201d;<br>Arlen didn&#x2019;t want to believe it. There had to be safe places in the world. But again the image of himself being thrown into the cellar flashed across his mind, and he knew that nowhere was truly safe at night.<br><br>The Messenger arrived an hour later. He was a tall man in his early thirties, with cropped brown hair and a short, thick beard. Draped about his broad shoulders was a shirt of metal links, and he wore a long dark cloak with thick leather breeches and boots. His mare was a sleek brown courser. Strapped to the horse&#x2019;s saddle was a harness holding a number of different spears. His face was grim as he approached, but his shoulders were high and proud. He scanned the crowd and spotted the Speaker easily as she stood giving orders. He turned his horse toward her.</p><h2>Folktales from India (The Pantheon Fairy Tale and Folklore Library)</h2><p>An enchanting collection of 110 tales, translated from twenty-two different languages, that are by turns harrowing and comic, sardonic and allegorical, mysterious and romantic.

The Regency (1811&#x2013;1820) began when the profligate Prince of Wales&#x2015;the future king George IV&#x2015;replaced his insane father, George III, as Britain&#x2019;s ruler.</p><p>Around the regent surged a society steeped in contrasts: evangelicalism and hedonism, elegance and brutality, exuberance and despair. The arts flourished at this time with a showcase of extraordinary writers and painters such as Jane Austen, Lord Byron, the Shelleys, John Constable, and J. M. W. Turner. Science burgeoned during this decade, too, giving us the steam locomotive and the blueprint for the modern computer.</p><p>Yet the dark side of the era was visible in poverty, slavery, pornography, opium, and the gothic imaginings that birthed the novel <em>Frankenstein</em>. With the British military in foreign lands, fighting the Napoleonic Wars in Europe and the War of 1812 in the United States, the desire for empire and an expanding colonial enterprise gained unstoppable momentum. Exploring these crosscurrents, Robert Morrison illuminates the profound ways this period shaped and indelibly marked the modern world.</p> 38 black and white illustrations</p><p><strong>Robert Morrison</strong> is British Academy Global Professor at Bath Spa University in England, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

The proposed Reform Bill promises political change; the building of railroads alters both the physical and cultural landscape; new scientific approaches to medicine incite public division; and scandal lurks behind respectability. The quiet drama of ordinary lives and flawed choices are played out in the complexly portrayed central characters of the novel&#x2014;the idealistic Dorothea Brooke; the ambitious Dr. Lydgate; the spendthrift Fred Vincy; and the steadfast Mary Garth. The appearance of two outsiders further disrupts the town&#x2019;s equilibrium&#x2014;Will Ladislaw, the spirited nephew of Dorothea&#x2019;s husband, the Rev. Edward Casaubon, and the sinister John Raffles, who threatens to expose the hidden past of one of the town&#x2019;s elite. <i>Middlemarch</i> displays George Eliot&#x2019;s clear-eyed yet humane understanding of characters caught up in the mysterious unfolding of self-knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.One of the most accomplished and prominent novels of the Victorian era, <i>Middlemarch</i> is an unsurpassed portrait of nineteenth-century English provincial life. Dorothea Brooke is a young woman of fervent ideals who yearns to effect social change yet faces resistance from the society she inhabits. In this epic in a small landscape, Eliot's large cast of precisely delineated characters and the rich tapestry of their stories result in a wise, compassionate, and astute vision of human nature. As Virginia Woolf declared, George Eliot "was one of the first English novelists to discover that men and women think as well as feel, and the discovery was of great artistic moment."<p><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p></p><h2>How German Is It</h2><p><p><strong>Ulrich Hargenau testifies against fellow members of a German terrorist group in order to save himself and his wife, Paula, and contemplates the nature of his German heritage.</strong></p> The question&nbsp;How German Is It&nbsp;underlies the conduct and actions of the characters in Walter Abish's novel, an icy panorama of contemporary Germany, in which the tradition of order and obedience, the patrimony of the saber and the castle on the Rhine, give way to the present, indiscriminate fascination with all things American.

Paula's participation in the destruction of a police station; the State's cynical response to crush the terrorists; two attempts on Ulrich's life; the discovery in Brumholdstein of a mass grave of death camp inmates&#x2013;&#x2013;all these, with subtle irony, are presented as pieces of a puzzle spelling out the turmoil of a society's endeavor to avoid the implications of its menacing heritage.</p><p>The question How German Is It underlies the conduct and actions of the characters in Walter Abish&#39;s novel, an icy panorama of contemporary Germany, in which the tradition of order and obedience, the patrimony of the saber and the castle on the Rhine, give way to the present, indiscriminate fascination with all things American.Walter Abish was born in Vienna in 1931.

Leland Ryken&#x2015;a teacher of English and a scholar of Milton&#x2015;has spent his life asking students to think about the purpose of education, careers, and lives; in this volume he is celebrated by his colleagues who, in turn, are asking these questions of their own students.

They share a flirtation over their red wine . . . and he doesn't see her again. It's the old familiar story for Morse. Then one day he just happens to be in Jericho, where Anne Scott lives. Nobody's home--and Morse should know since her door is unlocked and he takes a quick look inside. Only later does Morse learn that the lady was at home, just not alive.

Some people, especially those who are not religious, are not sure how to substantiate this view. <em>Whatever Happened to Good and Evil?</em> provides a basis for exploring these doubts and ultimately defends the objectivity of ethics. Engaging and accessible, it is the first introduction to meta-ethics written especially for students and general readers with no philosophical background. Focusing on the issues at the foundation of morality, it poses such questions as: How can we know what is right and wrong? Does ethical objectivity require God? Why should I be moral? Where do moral standards come from? What is a moral value, and how can it exist in a scientific world? Do cultural diversity and persistent moral disagreement support moral skepticism? <br> Writing in a clear and lively style and employing many examples to illustrate theoretical arguments, Russ Shafer-Landau identifies the many weaknesses in contemporary moral skepticism and devotes considerable attention to presenting, and critiquing, the most difficult objections to his view. Also included in the book are a helpful summary of all the major arguments covered, as well as a glossary of key philosophical terms. <em>Whatever Happened to Good and Evil?</em> is ideal for a variety of philosophy courses and compelling reading for anyone interested in ethics.<br></p><p>Russ Shafer-Landau is at University of Wisconsin.<br>"The idea behind this book was ingeniously conceived, and the execution of that idea is handled brilliantly. This is a superb book. It is philosophically astute, passionately argued, and written in a wonderfully accessible and eloquent style. I've never seen a better introduction to meta-ethics."--Brad Hooker, <em>University of Reading</em><p></p><br>"This is an excellent introductory textbook on moral relativism and objectivity. It is concise, well-written, well-organized, and well-reasoned. It fills a real gap in the literature."--Paul K. Moser, <em>Loyola University of Chicago</em><p></p><br>"The topic is timely, the execution is admirable, and there is no other book quite like it. I would gladly assign it to my students and recommend it to other teachers."--Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, <em>Dartmouth College</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Oxford Picture Dictionary English-Arabic: Bilingual Dictionary for Arabic-speaking teenage and adult students of English (Oxford Picture Dictionary 2E)</h2><p>Content is organized within <strong>12 thematic units</strong>, including Everyday Language, People, Housing, Food and Recreation. <br><br>Each unit starts with an <strong>Intro page </strong>(new to this edition) and ends with a story page, with single or double-page sub-topics introducing new words in a realistic visual context and easy-to-learn "chunks."<br><br>The <strong>target new vocabulary </strong>is listed and simple practice activities help students put their new words into practice.<br><br>Story pages include <strong>pre-reading </strong>questions to build previewing and predicting skills and <strong>post-reading</strong> questions and <strong>role-play</strong> activities to support critical thinking and to encourage students to use the new language they have learned. <br><br>Rich visual contexts recycle words from the unit.

Olaf Stapledon is prominent. <i>Last and First Men</i> and <i>Starmaker</i> are generally considered to be the finest future histories ever written, the gage by which all earlier and later works are measured. <i>Odd John</i> and <i>Sirius</i> are no less accurate in dealing with the problem in another guise. The central question is: if and when a superior being is introduced into a culture, how will either survive? Stapledon&#x2019;s answers are by no means romantic fantasies; they are the pathetic, realistic conclusions which we, one day, may be forced to accept.<br><i>Odd John</i> is the definitive fictionalization of the mutated superman. After a strange birth and childhood, John is suddenly compelled to accept the fact that he is different. What is more, he has to decide what to do with his gifts. <i>Sirius,</i> although the logical successor to <i>Odd John, </i>deals with quite another being &#x2014; an alien intelligence, artificially produced, a dog with superhuman mentality, who is not only superior to his own kind, but rejected by those with whom he has most in common. Stapledon uses his powers &#x2014; intellectual, imaginative, and observant &#x2014; to detail the conflict in its very "human" form.<br><i>Odd John</i> and <i>Sirius</i> are something else besides explorations of superbeings. Stapledon is capable of a great deal of humor and tongue-in-cheek description. If his writing, as he says in the subtitle to <i>Odd John,</i> is between jest and earnest, his sympathies are divided between the conflicting forces of man and superman. For those in literature, in psychology, in philosophy, or even in the world as it now exists, the detailed histories of these two strange beings will be ones to ponder. If anything, we have moved closer to the stage when conflict between superior and sapient man is imminent.</p><p>A preeminent figure of British science fiction, Olaf Stapledon (1886-1950) wrote several influential novels. Praised by H. G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, and Virginia Woolf, Stapledon&#39;s works introduced such innovative concepts as genetic engineering and terraforming.</p><h2>Mary Thomas&#39;s Knitting Book</h2><p>There is a knitting book as dependable as your own private instructor, as complete, as explicit, and equally as helpful . . . <i>Mary Thomas's Knitting Book.</i> It's a veritable encyclopedia of knitting, clearly and definitively explaining and illustrating every method, operation and stitch, and a good number of the&nbsp;patterns you are ever likely to need or use. <br>After an engaging history of the craft and its implements, Miss Thomas carefully lays the foundation of knitting in the opening chapters &#x2015; how to hold needles, wind yarn, gauge stitches, control tension, etc. &#x2015; and builds gradually upon it in the following sections. These explain in lucid progression every operation in common knitting, from basic knit stitch and purl, casting on and casting off, shaping by decreases and increases to turning, triangular shapes and mitres, and knitting on the diagonal or bias. <br>For the reader who has mastered these fundamental procedures, Miss Thomas devotes the remainder&nbsp;of the book to fancy knitting stitches and techniques, including color knitting by stranding and weaving; pattern weaving; knitting woven, by frame with its complement of stitches (plain, raised, rib, etc.), looped, beaded, embroidered by chart, using cross stitch, honeycomb, etc.; and making patterns for garments and working out their details (armholes, belts, buttonholes, collars, hems, necklines, pockets et al). To put what the reader learns into practice, she offers instructions and patterns for making various Shetland shawls, gloves, and socks. <br>More than 250 technique diagrams clearly illustrate every operation and pattern as to position of hands, yarn, and needle, so the knitter will have no trouble in following along. For all knitters, whether beginner or adept, a chapter of helpful knitting hints on blocking, picking up dropped stitches, lengthening, knitting up, mending, taking-back (correcting), etc. completes these invaluable and personalized lessons.<br>Unabridged republication of original (1938) edition.</p><p></p><h2>The Diary Of Anais Nin Volume 2 1934-1939: Vol. 2 (1934-1939)</h2><p>Beginning with Nin's arrival in New York, this volume is filled with the stories of her analytical patients.

Red Teaming is the cure for this anxiety. The term was coined by the U.S. Army, which has developed the most comprehensive and effective approach to Red Teaming in the world today in response to the debacles of its recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, the roots of Red Teaming run very deep: to the Roman Catholic Church&#x2019;s &#x201c;Office of the Devil&#x2019;s Advocate,&#x201d; to the <i>Kriegsspiel</i> of the Prussian General Staff and to the secretive AMAN organization, Israel&#x2019;s Directorate of Military Intelligence. In this book, author Bryce Hoffman shows business how to use the same techniques to better plan for the uncertainties of today&#x2019;s rapidly changing economy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Red Teaming is both a set of analytical tools and a mindset. It is designed to overcome the mental blind spots and cognitive biases that all of us fall victim to when we try to address complex problems. The same heuristics that allow us to successfully navigate life and business also cause us to miss or ignore important information. It is a simple and provable fact that we do not know what we do not know. The good news is that, through Red Teaming, we can find out.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this book, Hoffman shows how the most innovative and disruptive companies, such as Google and Toyota, already employ some of these techniques organically. He also shows how many high-profile business failures, including those that sparked the Great Recession, could easily have been averted by using these approaches. Most importantly, he teaches leaders how to make Red Teaming part of their own planning process, laying the foundation for a movement that will change the way America does business.</p><p>BRYCE G.

When you are ignorant of the enemy, but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal. If ignorant both of your enemy and yourself, you are certain in every battle to be in peril.</i></p><p><b>&#x2014;Sun Tzu</b><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>On a cold, clear morning in March 2015, I eased my car past the hand-�hewn stone walls and imposing iron gates of the old military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. When they used to talk about sending someone to break rocks at Leavenworth, they meant it. This was where the American military sent the baddest of its bad apples for more than a century. In 1875, the U.S. Army marched the first inmates out to what was still the frontier and forced them to build their prison around themselves, hewing it block by block from the native stone in a scene worthy of Kafka. Officially known as the United States Disciplinary Barracks, it served as the military&#x2019;s maximum security prison until it was deemed unfit even for the worst offenders. The main building had been torn down in 2002&#x2014;�and its inmates transferred to a modern, concrete penitentiary built at a more remote location on the base. I now found myself looking for a parking space on the fresh black asphalt that covered the area where the old cellblocks once stood. The rest of the original prison complex, from the walls and guard towers to the infirmary and workshops, still remained. Some of those buildings had been converted into offices. Others, including a stone edifice that had once housed the gallows, had been converted into classrooms. After a lengthy security check, I headed there, pressed my newly issued security pass to the electronic reader mounted next to the door of classroom 104, and tried to slip inside as discreetly as possible.</p><p>But it is hard to be discreet when you are the only civilian in a classroom full of soldiers.</p><p>There were a dozen other students, all wearing battle dress uniforms, and all of them turned in unison when I opened the door and eyed me suspiciously. Eleven were army majors, or soon to be promoted to that rank. One was an air force intelligence officer. Almost all of them had served multiple combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many wore the army&#x2019;s Combat Action Badge on their left breast, proof that they had been in the thick of it. Several sported paratroopers&#x2019; jump wings. Some were highly decorated. One had a green beret sitting on top of his notebook. The room was occupied by an enormous U-shaped table with seats arranged around the outside edge. A name card was placed in front of each seat. Mine said mr. hoffman. All the others said major so-�and-�so.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You must be important,&#x201d; said the officer to my left as I slipped into my seat.</p><p>&#x201c;I assure you, I&#x2019;m not,&#x201d; I promised.</p><p>&#x201c;Then why are you dressed that way?&#x201d; he asked, eyeing my wool sport coat and slacks.</p><p>The only other person dressed <i>that way</i> was our instructor, Dr. Kevin Benson. He was a tall, lanky gentleman with a drooping white mustache that made him look like a frontier sheriff. But at least Benson was a retired colonel. And not just any retired colonel. He was, quite literally, the man who had written the invasion plan for Iraq. I felt like I was crashing a party I was not dressed for and had no business attending. But I was right where I needed to be if I was going to learn about <i>red teaming</i>&#x2014;�a revolutionary way to stress-�test strategies and navigate an uncertain future that I had first learned about from a zombie movie.</p><p><br>***<br><br></p><p>I don&#x2019;t like zombie movies. I never have. But several friends whose opinions I respect had recommended the 2013 film <i>World War Z</i>&#x2014;�and while I did not respect their opinions enough to actually go to the theater and see it, I did remember what they had said a few months later when I found myself laid up on the couch with a bad cold, scanning the list of new releases on Amazon Instant Video, looking for a way to kill the afternoon. <i>World War Z</i> was at the top of the list. It seemed suitably mindless, so I clicked on the &#x201c;Play&#x201d; button.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t tell you much about the movie&#x2014;�most of it was quickly lost in a decongestant haze&#x2014;�but one scene struck me like a shotgun blast to the face of an ambulatory corpse. Early on in the film, it emerges that only one nation, Israel, has managed to avoid the virally induced zombie apocalypse that has destroyed the rest of human civilization. Our hero, Brad Pitt, is sent to Jerusalem by what is left of the United States government to find out why. A senior Mossad officer meets Pitt at the airport and explains that his country decided to seal its borders after receiving reports of a fast-�moving zombie plague in India. Other nations received the same hard-�to-�believe information but dismissed these reports as absurd. When Pitt asks why Israel decided to act upon them, the Mossad man credits the &#x201c;Tenth Man Doctrine,&#x201d; which he says Israel adopted in the wake of the Yom Kippur War.</p><p>&#x201c;In the month before October 1973 we saw Arab troop movements, and we unanimously agreed that they didn&#x2019;t pose a threat. Now, a month later, the Arab attack almost drove us into the sea. So, we decided to make a change,&#x201d; the Israeli explains. &#x201c;If nine of us with the same information arrive at the exact same conclusion, it&#x2019;s the duty of the tenth man to disagree. No matter how improbable it may seem, the tenth man has to start thinking with the assumption that the other nine were wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>In this case, he was that tenth man, and he had managed to persuade his peers to close Israel&#x2019;s borders as a precaution, thereby preventing the zombie plague from infecting his country.</p><p>That didn&#x2019;t matter much in the movie; the zombies were at the Wailing Wall a few minutes later. However, it mattered a great deal to me&#x2014;�not because I spent a lot of time thinking about how to contain the undead, but because I spent a lot of time thinking about how companies could plan better, overcome groupthink, and avoid the curse of complacency that so often seemed to follow on the heels of success at big corporations.</p><p>Two years earlier, I had written <i>American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company</i>. It had been a bestseller, and a number of CEOs in the United States and other countries had adopted my book as a manual for a new model of leadership&#x2014;�a forward-�looking, data-�driven approach to management that Mulally had used to save not only Ford but also Boeing. Many of those CEOs had wanted to learn more about Mulally&#x2019;s method, and several had asked me to help them implement his ideas in their organizations. I quickly discovered that helping companies solve their problems was a more satisfying way to earn a living than writing about those problems. So I decided to quit my job at the <i>Detroit News</i> after twenty years as a business journalist and was in the process of launching a new career as a management consultant.</p><p>I knew Mulally&#x2019;s system worked. I&#x2019;d seen it save Ford, and I had already helped a couple of companies use it to make dramatic improvements to their own operations. Yet I was worried that this system, by itself, was not enough. And I wasn&#x2019;t the only one. Bill Ford, the great-�grandson of Henry Ford and the automaker&#x2019;s executive chairman, told me the fear that still kept him up at night: Ford might come to take its newfound success for granted and lose the edge Mulally had honed so carefully. Yes, Mulally had saved Ford from bankruptcy and achieved record profitability. Yes, he had neutralized Ford&#x2019;s caustic corporate culture and replaced it with a collaborative, team-�based management system. But as Bill Ford knew better than most, his company had squandered its success before, and he was worried that it might do it again.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s something that I think about all the time,&#x201d; Ford told me. &#x201c;How do we not go back to where we were? How do we stay lean and hungry? And how do we continue to foster innovation?&#x201d;1&nbsp;</p><p>Mulally&#x2019;s management system required senior executives to continually examine their plans and assumptions. However, I knew that the longer those plans and assumptions remained valid, the harder it would be for the men and women at the top of the house to question them. Complacency is part of human nature. When things are going well, most of us prefer to assume they will continue to go well. Groupthink is also part of human nature. We are social creatures, and we put a bigger premium on conformity and cohesion than most of us would like to believe&#x2014;�particularly in large organizations, where staying on the right side of internal politics is often the key to job security and promotion. And while many people see big multinationals like Ford as fundamentally dehumanizing, I had spent enough time covering them as a reporter to know such organizations actually magnified human nature&#x2014;�sometimes to a troubling degree.&nbsp;</p><p>It was complacency and groupthink that had gotten Ford into trouble in the first place. Like its crosstown rivals, General Motors and Chrysler, Ford had taken the success it enjoyed in the decades after World War&nbsp;II for granted. Management and labor alike came to view that success as a birthright, rather than as something they had to go out and fight for every day. Even after foreign rivals figured out how to beat the American automakers at their own game, Detroit&#x2019;s Big Three continued to believe the lackluster cars they were producing remained competitive. That self-�delusion extended from the boardroom all the way down to the factory floor, where the men and women who built those cars labored under the erroneous belief that their gold-�plated wages and benefits were exempt from the business cycle and impervious to the pressures of globalization. It took a Great Recession to rouse Detroit from its reverie and shatter its belief that America&#x2019;s automakers were too big to fail.</p><p>Fortunately for Ford, Mulally had arrived just ahead of that tidal wave of reality. He forced the company to take a hard look at its products and practices, and he borrowed enough money to fix them before the gates of the global credit markets slammed shut. GM and Chrysler were not so lucky. They went bankrupt and were only revived by the American taxpayers. Thanks to Mulally&#x2019;s leadership, Ford saved itself. But the question was, for how long?</p><p>As the person who wrote the book on Ford, it was a question I was being asked a lot as Mulally&#x2019;s retirement date approached and speculation began to swirl about his successor. I knew the system he put in place was capable of keeping Ford on the right trajectory, but only if the company continued to use it with the same unflinching honesty Mulally insisted upon. I suspected Mulally had driven the company&#x2019;s chronic complacency and groupthink into remission, but not eradicated those diseases entirely. So as Brad Pitt continued his quest to find a cure for the zombie plague, I found myself wondering whether this Tenth Man Doctrine might not be the cure for these all-�too-�actual maladies of business.</p><p>First, I had to find out if it was real.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I tracked down a former Israeli Defense Forces spokesman, Eytan Buchman, who helped separate fact from fiction.</p><p>&#x201c;The Israeli military does indeed have a similar doctrine, but it is not called the Tenth Man Doctrine,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;After the Yom Kippur War, the IDF&#x2019;s Intelligence Directorate created a red team, a devil&#x2019;s advocate team that can challenge prevalent assumptions within intelligence bodies.&#x201d;</p><p>Buchman described a small, elite organization that went by the code name <i>Ipcha Mistabra,</i> an Aramaic term used frequently in the Talmud that means something along the lines of, &#x201c;on the contrary, the reality appears otherwise.&#x201d; Its motto was, &#x201c;He who thinks, wins.&#x201d;</p><p>So, it <i>was</i> real, but how did it work?</p><p>I knew what a devil&#x2019;s advocate was. What I didn&#x2019;t know, but soon learned, was that the devil&#x2019;s advocate was an actual office in the Roman Catholic Church. <i>Advocatus diaboli</i> is the popular title given to the <i>promotor fidei,</i> or &#x201c;promoter of the faith,&#x201d; an important officer of the Sacred Congregation of Rites whose job is to challenge all nominations for sainthood through a skeptical analysis of the candidate&#x2019;s character and supposed miracles. While this function has changed over time, the Catholic Church still employs hostile witnesses as part of the process of vetting potential saints. In 2002, for example, the Church called atheists Christopher Hitchens and Aroup Chatterjee to testify against Mother Teresa during her beatification proceedings. Hitchens later complained that he had not been paid for this service and had, therefore, represented the Devil pro bono<i>.</i>2</p><p>While that might seem a bit comical to laypeople, I could see how a similar approach could be used to stress-�test military planning assumptions.</p><p>Or a new product strategy.</p><p>Or a merger proposal.</p><p>Or a business plan.</p><p>But what was the &#x201c;red team&#x201d; that Buchman referred to?</p><p>Before covering the automobile industry in Detroit, I had spent much of the 1990s covering the high-�tech industry in Silicon Valley. There, I had heard the term <i>red team</i> used in reference to the &#x201c;white hat&#x201d; hackers companies paid to break in to their computer networks in order to expose vulnerabilities so that those holes could be patched before the more nefarious &#x201c;black hat&#x201d; hackers discovered them. These red teams were widely employed to help protect sensitive computer networks and the data stored on them. But they did not seem to be what Buchman was referring to when he used the term <i>red team</i>.</p><p>It turns out there are many different types of red teams<i>.</i> In addition to the <i>cybersecurity red teams</i> I encountered in Silicon Valley, there are <i>penetration testing red teams</i> that probe the physical security of everything from secret government installations to corporate research-�and-�development laboratories. For example, U.S. Department of Homeland Security red teams send agents armed with fake bombs through airport screening lines to see if the Transportation Safety Administration&#x2019;s inspectors can catch them (too often, they cannot).3 Both military and business war-�gamers use <i>threat emulation red teams</i> as stand-�ins for the enemy. That enemy can be a rogue state or a rival company. Finally, there are <i>decision support red teams,</i> which use critical and contrarian thinking to stress-�test strategies, plans, and theories. These were the sort of red teams Buchman was talking about, and as I learned more about it, I became convinced that this sort of red teaming was exactly the sort of thing companies needed to dispel groupthink and complacency and cope with a rapidly changing&#x2014;�and increasingly uncertain&#x2014;� world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Israelis may have been the first to see the potential of red teaming, but they were not the last. The terrorist attacks of September&nbsp;11, 2001, and the disastrous wars that followed humbled the American military and intelligence agencies, prompting them to seek out new ways of thinking and alternative methods of analysis.</p><p>It was a sobering time for America&#x2019;s generals and spymasters.

Griffin retells the story (previously told in <i>Behind the Lines</i>) of Wendell Fertig, a U.S. Army officer who promoted himself to general and led a ragtag guerrilla force against the Japanese after the fall of the Philippines in 1943. This time, however, Griffin focuses his attention on the OSS, which, among other things, was tasked with resupplying Fertig and reinforcing his efforts to undermine the Japanese war machine. In this fourth volume of a bestselling series featuring the American intelligence service during World War II, James Whittaker, a rakish, romantic army air corps captain who happens to be a close family friend of OSS chief Wild Bill Donovan, is assigned to sneak into the Philippines by submarine and bring gold, arms, and war materiel to the renegade general. <p> Simultaneously, another OSS team tries to carry out a critical mission: getting a German atomic scientist out of Budapest and into allied hands before Hitler's armies can perfect and unleash the weapon that could win the war for the Axis powers. And in Cairo, a quiet, unassuming pilot named Darmstadter is drafted by the OSS for another highly unlikely mission. Griffin spices up his realistically drawn scenes of military operations, weapons, and training with a somewhat improbable love story focusing on Whittaker and a female OSS operative, but one suspects it's merely a ruse to draw in distaff readers. Still, the action ranges from Washington to California, Egypt to London, and all points in between, and Griffin's knowledge of military hearts, minds, and missions has won him a devoted following through five separate series of novels of men (and some women) in battle. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><b>W.

They recently had a conversation about their careers as picture book authors. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> When I was only four years old, I announced to my family in particular and to the world in general that I was going to become an artist, and write stories and draw pictures for books. I never swayed from that early declaration. I&#x2019;ve always been curious to know, what inspired you to become a creator and illustrator of picture books? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My career began as a graphic designer and for a number of years I worked as an art director for an advertising agency in New York. In the mid 1960's Bill Martin, Jr. saw an ad of a red lobster that I had designed and asked me to illustrate his <i>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</i> Well, I was set on fire! I was so inspired by this book, and the opportunity to illustrate it changed my life. After that, I started to create my own books, both words and pictures, and really it was then that I had found my true course in life. <br> <br> Now, I have a question for you, Tomie. How would you describe your artistic style, and has it changed over time? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> My illustration style is heavily influenced by folk art--strong simple shapes, bold lines, color, color, color and a deceptive simplicity. My style began to develop early in art school, and through the years, it hasn&#x2019;t changed very much, but it has refined itself. How would you describe yours? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My aim with my work is to simplify and refine, be logical and harmonious. I like to use simple shapes, bright colors and a lot of white space. I write for the child inside of me. That is always where I begin. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> I do, as well. The only audience I keep in mind is that four-year-old in me. People sometimes ask me what advice I would give to young artists. I always think of the wonderful advice I received from my twin cousins when they were in art school in the late '30s. They told me, &#x201c;Practice, practice, practice and don&#x2019;t copy.&#x201d; <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> I often tell people about the four magic letters: DO IT. I want to be encouraging but I can only offer the example of my own experience, which is just one approach. There are many wonderful artists to learn about, which is important. But you must use your own imagination. You have to just do it. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> How do you feel knowing that a copy of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> is sold every 30 seconds, somewhere in the world? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> It is hard for me, maybe for others too, to grasp this concept. But I am truly honored that my story is enjoyed by so many and that it is now being shared by a generation of parents who grew up with my book. How about your <i>Strega Nona</i>. She is one of your most popular characters. Can you share how she came to be? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> In the &#x2018;70s when I was teaching at a college, we were required to attend faculty meetings. I always sat in the back with a yellow legal pad. Everyone thought I was taking notes. At one meeting a doodle appeared of a little lady with a big nose and a big chin. I named her Strega Nona, and the rest is history. Speaking of history, how will you be celebrating the third annual <i>Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day this year? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> On <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day, March 20th, I will probably be at home with my wife, Bobbie (I am a bit of a hermit, actually). But I will be saying a little toast to the caterpillar for whom I have a special place in my heart. And speaking of holidays, isn&#x2019;t your favorite holiday Christmas. Do you have a special Christmas memory? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> Christmas is my favorite holiday. My favorite Christmas was the one when I received tons and tons of art supplies: everything from an easel to paints, pads and pads of paper, and &#x201c;how to draw&#x201d; books. <br>Tomie dePaola was born in Meriden, Connecticut, in 1934 to a family of Irish and Italian background. By the time he could hold a pencil, he knew what his life's work would be. His determination to create books for children led to a BFA from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and an MFA from the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts in Oakland, California.<p>It drove him through the years of teaching, designing greeting cards and stage sets, and painting church murals until 1965, when he illustrated his first children's book, <i>Sound</i>, by Lisa Miller for Coward-McCann. Eventually, freed of other obligations, he plunged full time into both writing and illustrating children's books.</p><p>He names Fra Angelico and Giotto, Georges Rouault, and Ben Shahn as major influences on his work, but he soon found his own unique style. His particular way with color, line, detail, and design have earned him many of the most prestigious awards in his field, among them a Caldecott Honor Award for <i>Strega Nona</i>, the Smithsonian Medal from the Smithsonian Institution, the Kerlan Award from the University of Minnesota for his "singular attainment in children's literature," the Catholic Library Association's Regina Medal for his "continued distinguished contribution," and the University of Southern Mississippi Medallion.

He writes, "It is a story about growing up, becoming a woman, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, within the space of a year and a half. But what a year and a half it is!" Welch offers a brief biography of Walker, who wrote nine of her thirteen novels while living in Montana.</p><p>With an arid "dry-land" wheat farm as both its geographic and metaphoric center, <b>Winter Wheat</b> tells the story of eighteen-year-old Ellen Webb. Her Vermont-born father and Russian-born mother, married during the first World War, have come as homesteaders to Barton, Montana - a grain-elevator and general store. It is 1940, the year Ellen will start college if the wheat harvest is good; it is September, "like a quiet day after a whole week of wind. I mean that wind that blows dirt into your eyes and hair and between your teeth and roars in your ears after you've gone inside." The harvest pays and Ellen goes off to college, where she immediately falls in love: "I hadn't meant to fall in love so soon, but there's nothing you can do about it. It's like planning to seed in April and then having it come off so warm in March that the earth is ready." Ellen and Gil plan their marriage for after the summer harvest. But Gil arrives and doesn't find Montana or the life of dry-land wheat farmers beautiful. Ellen begins to see everything, including her parents, with new and critical eyes in this unsparing and poignant examination of love and life. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Jesse Larsen</i></p><h2>Killer Pancake (Goldy Culinary Mysteries, Book 5)</h2><p><b>A lethally tantalizing novel by the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Sticks &amp; Scones</i></b><br><br>When Goldy, owner of Goldilocks&#x2019; Catering, whips up a sumptuous lowfat feast for the Mignon Cosmetics&#x2019; company banquet, she discovers just how ugly the beauty biz can be! <br><br>On the day of the banquet Goldy finds herself confronting an angry mob of demonstrators&#x2014;&#x201c;Spare the Hares&#x201d;&#x2014;who object to Mignon Cosmetics&#x2019; animal-testing policies.

In focusing on Dogen's most practical words of instruction and encouragement for Zen students, this new collection highlights the timelessness of his teaching and shows it to be as applicable to anyone today as it was in the great teacher's own time. Selections include Dogen's famous meditation instructions; his advice on the practice of <i>zazen,</i> or sitting meditation; guidelines for community life; and some of his most inspirational talks. Also included are a bibliography and an extensive glossary.</p><p>Dogen (1200&#x2013;1253) is known as the founder of the Japanese Soto Zen sect.</p><h2>Trumponomics: Inside the America First Plan to Revive Our Economy</h2><p><p>Donald Trump promised the American people a transformative change in economic policy after eight years of stagnation under Obama. But he didn&#x2019;t adopt a conventional left or right economic agenda. His is a new economic populism that combines some conventional Republican ideas&#x2013;tax cuts, deregulation, more power to the states&#x2013;with more traditional Democratic issues such as trade protectionism and infrastructure spending. It also mixes in important populist issues such as immigration reform, pressuring the Europeans to pay for more of their own defense, and keeping America first. </p><p>In <i>Trumponomics</i>, conservative economists Stephen Moore and Arthur B. Laffer offer a well-informed defense of the president's approach to trade, taxes, employment, infrastructure, and other economic policies. Moore and Laffer worked as senior economic advisors to Donald Trump in 2016. They traveled with him, frequently met with his political and economic teams, worked on his speeches, and represented him as surrogates. They are currently members of the Trump Advisory Council and still meet with him regularly. In<i> Trumponomics, </i>they offer an insider&#x2019;s view on how Trump operates in public and behind closed doors, his priorities and passions, and his greatest attributes and liabilities. </p><p>Trump is betting his presidency that he can create an economic revival in America&#x2019;s industrial heartland. Can he really bring jobs back to the rust belt? Can he cut taxes and bring the debt down? Above all, does he have the personal discipline, the vision, the right team, and the right strategy to pull off his ambitious economic goals? Moore and Laffer believe that he can pull it off and that Trumponomics will usher in a new era of prosperity for all Americans.</p></p><p>Stephen Moore and Arthur B. Laffer are the economists behind the job creation platform that brought Trump to victory. Stephen Moore is a former member of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>'s editorial board, and the Distinguished Visiting Fellow for The Heritage Foundation's Project for Economic Growth. Arthur B. Laffer, the Father of Supply-Side Economics, was a member of Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board. Moore and Laffer are coauthors of <i>Trumponomics</i>."Stephen Moore and Arthur Laffer, two very talented men, have just completed an incredible book on my Economic Policies, or, as they call it, TRUMPONOMICS. They have really done a great job in capturing my long-held views and ideas. This book is on sale now&#x2015;a terrific read of a really interesting subject!" &#x2015;President Donald Trump</p><h2>The Last Hope (Warriors: Omen of the Stars No. 6)</h2><p><p>The end of the stars draws near.

Robert Proctor demonstrates that the common picture of a passive scientific community coerced into cooperation with the Nazis fails to grasp the reality of what actually happened&#x2015;namely, that many of the political initiatives of the Nazis arose from within the scientific community, and that medical scientists actively designed and administered key elements of National Socialist policy.</p><p>The book presents the most comprehensive account to date of German medical involvement in the sterilization and castration laws, the laws banning marriage between Jews and non-Jews, and the massive program to destroy &#x201c;lives not worth living.&#x201d; The study traces attempts on the part of doctors to conceive of the &#x201c;Jewish problem&#x201d; as a &#x201c;medical problem,&#x201d; and how medical journals openly discussed the need to find a &#x201c;final solution&#x201d; to Germany&#x2019;s Jewish and gypsy &#x201c;problems.&#x201d;</p><p>Proctor makes us aware that such thinking was not unique to Germany. The social Darwinism of the late nineteenth century in America and Europe gave rise to theories of racial hygiene that were embraced by enthusiasts of various nationalities in the hope of breeding a better, healthier, stronger race of people. Proctor also presents an account of the &#x201c;organic&#x201d; health movement that flourished under the Nazis, including campaigns to reduce smoking and drinking, and efforts to require bakeries to produce whole-grain bread. A separate chapter is devoted to the emergence of a resistance movement among doctors in the Association of Socialist Physicians. The book is based on a close analysis of contemporary documents, including German state archives and more than two hundred medical journals published during the period.</p><p>Proctor has set out not merely to tell a story but also to urge reflection on what might be called the &#x201c;political philosophy of science&#x201d;&#x2015;how movements that shape the policies of nations can also shape the structure and priorities of science. The broad implications of this book make it of consequence not only to historians, physicians, and people concerned with the history and philosophy of science, but also to those interested in science policy and medical ethics.</p></p><p>&#39;Proctor&#39;s carefully argued book not only forces us to reassess the dynamics of Nazism but also challenges pervasive notions about the political neutrality and objective value of science and the moral innocence of scientists ..(a) provocative study.&#39; --Mary Nolan, &#39;New York Times Book Review&#39;Robert N. Proctor is Professor of History and, by courtesy, of Medicine, at Stanford University.</p><h2>Theodore Boone: the Abduction</h2><p>Theodore Boone is back in a new adventure, and the stakes are higher than ever. When his best friend, April, disappears from her bedroom in the middle of the night, no one, not even Theo Boone--who knows April better than anyone--has answers.<br><br> As fear ripples through his small hometown and the police hit dead ends, it's up to Theo to use his legal knowledge and investigative skills to chase down the truth and save April.<br><br> Filled with the page-turning suspense that made John Grisham a #1 international bestseller and the undisputed master of the legal thriller, Theodore Boone's trials and triumphs will keep readers guessing until the very end.</p><p>John Grisham is the author of a collection of stories, a work of nonfiction, three sports novels, four kids&#39; books, and many legal thrillers. His work has been translated into forty-two languages. He lives near Charlottesville, Virginia.<p>Chapter 1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The abduction of April Finnemore took place in the dead of night, sometime between 9:15 p.m., when she last spoke with Theo Boone, and 3:30 a.m., when her mother entered her bedroom and realized she was gone. The abduction appeared to have been rushed; whoever took April did not allow her to gather her things. Her laptop was left behind. Though her bedroom was fairly neat, there was some clothing strewn about, which made it difficult to determine if she had been able to pack. Probably not, the police thought. Her toothbrush was still by the sink. Her backpack was by her bed. Her pajamas were on the floor, so she at least had been allowed to change. Her mother, when she wasn&#x2019;t crying or ranting, told the police that her daughter&#x2019;s favorite blue-and-white sweater was not in the closet. And April&#x2019;s favorite sneakers were gone, too.</p><p>The police soon dismissed the notion that she&#x2019;d simply run away. There was no reason to run away, her mother assured them, and she had not packed the things that would make such an escape successful.</p><p>A quick inspection of the home revealed no apparent break-in. The windows were all closed and locked, as were the three doors downstairs. Whoever took April was careful enough to close the door behind them, and lock it on the way out. After observing the scene and listening to Mrs. Finnemore for about an hour, the police decided to have a talk with Theo Boone. He was, after all, April&#x2019;s best friend, and they usually chatted by phone or online at night before going to sleep.</p><p>At the Boone home, the phone rang at 4:33, according to the digital clock next to the bed where the parents slept. Mr. Woods Boone, the lighter sleeper, grabbed the phone, while Mrs. Marcella Boone rolled over and began wondering who would call at such an hour. When Mr. Boone said, &#x201c;Yes, Officer,&#x201d; Mrs. Boone really woke up and scrambled out of bed. She listened to his end of the conversation, soon understood that it had something to do with April Finnemore, and was really confused when her husband said, &#x201c;Sure, Officer, we can be over there in fifteen minutes.&#x201d; He hung up, and she said, &#x201c;What is it, Woods?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Apparently, April&#x2019;s been abducted, and the police would like to talk to Theo.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I doubt if he abducted her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, if he&#x2019;s not upstairs in his room, we may have a problem.&#x201d;</p><p>He was upstairs in his room, sound asleep, undisturbed by the ringing of the phone. As he threw on blue jeans and a sweatshirt, he explained to his parents that he had called April the night before on his cell phone and they&#x2019;d chatted for a few minutes, same as usual.</p><p>As they drove through Strattenburg in the predawn darkness, Theo could think of nothing but April and of her miserable home life, her warring parents, her scarred brother and sister, both of whom had fled as soon as they were old enough. April was the youngest of three children born to two people who had no business having a family. Both parents were crazy, according to April herself, and Theo certainly agreed. Both had drug convictions. Her mother kept goats on a small farm outside of town and made cheese, bad cheese in Theo&#x2019;s opinion. She peddled it around town in an old funeral hearse painted yellow, with a pet spider monkey riding shotgun. Her father was an aging hippie, who still played in a bad garage band with a bunch of other leftovers from the 1980s. He had no real job and was often gone for weeks. The Finnemores were in a perpetual state of separation, with talk of divorce always in the air.</p><p>April confided in Theo, and told him things he vowed to never repeat.</p><p>The Finnemore home was owned by someone else, a rental house April hated because her parents had no interest in maintaining it. It was in an older section of Strattenburg, on a shady street lined with other postwar homes that had seen better days. Theo had been there only one time, for a less-than-successful birthday party April&#x2019;s mother had thrown together two years earlier. Most of the kids who&#x2019;d been invited did not attend because their parents wouldn&#x2019;t allow it. Such was the Finnemore family reputation.</p><p>There were two police cars in the driveway when the Boones arrived. Across the street, the neighbors were on their porches, watching.</p><p>Mrs. Finnemore&#x2014;she went by the name of May and had named her children April, March, and August&#x2014;was in the living room on a sofa talking to a uniformed officer when the Boones entered, rather awkwardly. Quick introductions were made; Mr. Boone had never met her.</p><p>&#x201c;Theo!&#x201d; Mrs. Finnemore said, very dramatically. &#x201c;Someone has taken our April!&#x201d; Then she burst into tears and reached to hug Theo. He wanted no part of being hugged but went along with the ritual out of respect. As always, she wore a large flowing garment that was more of a tent than a dress, light brown in color and made from what appeared to be burlap. Her long graying hair was pulled into a tight ponytail. Crazy as she was, Theo had always been struck by her beauty. She made no effort at being attractive&#x2014;quite unlike his mother&#x2014;but some things you can&#x2019;t hide. She was also very creative, liked to paint and do pottery, in addition to making goat cheese. April had inherited the good genes&#x2014;the pretty eyes, the artistic flair.</p><p>When Mrs. Finnemore settled down, Mrs. Boone asked the officer, &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; He responded with a quick summary of what little they knew at that point.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you talk to her last night?&#x201d; the officer asked Theo. The cop&#x2019;s name was Bolick, Sergeant Bolick, which Theo knew because he&#x2019;d seen him around the courthouse. Theo knew most of the policemen in Strattenburg, as well as most of the lawyers, judges, janitors, and clerks in the courthouse.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. At nine fifteen, according to my phone log. We talk almost every night before going to bed,&#x201d; Theo said. Bolick had the reputation of being a wise guy. Theo wasn&#x2019;t prepared to like him.</p><p>&#x201c;How sweet. Did she say anything that might be useful here? Was she worried? Scared?&#x201d;</p><p>Theo was immediately caught in a vise. He could not lie to a police officer, yet he could not tell a secret that he&#x2019;d promised he wouldn&#x2019;t tell. So he fudged a bit by saying, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t recall anything like that.&#x201d; Mrs. Finnemore was no longer crying; she was staring intensely at Theo, her eyes glowing.</p><p>&#x201c;What did you talk about?&#x201d; Sergeant Bolick asked. A detective in plainclothes entered the room and listened carefully.</p><p>&#x201c;The usual stuff. School, homework, I don&#x2019;t remember everything.&#x201d; Theo had watched enough trials to know that answers should often be kept vague, and that &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t recall&#x201d; and &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember&#x201d; were perfectly acceptable in many instances.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you chat online?&#x201d; the detective asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir, not last night. Just phone.&#x201d; They often used Facebook and text messages, but Theo knew not to volunteer information. Just answer the question in front of you. He&#x2019;d heard his mother say this to her clients many times.</p><p>&#x201c;Any sign of a break-in?&#x201d; Mr. Boone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;None,&#x201d; said Bolick. &#x201c;Mrs. Finnemore was sound asleep in the downstairs bedroom, she heard nothing, and at some point she got up to check on April. That&#x2019;s when she realized she was gone.&#x201d;</p><p>Theo looked at Mrs. Finnemore, who again shot him a fierce look. He knew the truth, and she knew he knew the truth. Trouble was, Theo couldn&#x2019;t tell the truth because he&#x2019;d made a promise to April.</p><p>The truth was that Mrs. Finnemore had not been home for the past two nights. April had been living alone, terrified, with all the doors and windows locked as tightly as possible; with a chair jammed against her bedroom door; with an old baseball bat across the end of her bed; with the phone close and ready to dial 911, and with no one in the world to talk to but Theodore Boone, who had vowed not to tell a soul. Her father was out of town with his band. Her mother was taking pills and losing her mind.</p><p>&#x201c;In the past few days, has April said anything about running away?&#x201d; the detective was asking Theo.</p><p>Oh, yes. Nonstop. She wants to run away to Paris and study art. She wants to run away to LA and live with March, her older sister. She wants to run away to Santa Fe and become a painter. She wants to run away, period.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t recall anything like that,&#x201d; Theo said, and it was the truth because &#x201c;in the past few days&#x201d; could mean almost anything; thus, the question was too vague to require a definite answer on his part. He had seen this time and time again in trials. In his opinion, Sergeant Bolick and the detective were being far too sloppy with their questions. So far, they had not been able to pin him down, and he had not told a lie.</p><p>May Finnemore was overcome with tears and made a big show out of crying. Bolick and the detective quizzed Theo about April&#x2019;s other friends, any potential problems she was having, how she was doing in school, and so on. Theo gave straight answers, with no wasted words.</p><p>A female officer in uniform had entered the den from upstairs, and she sat with Mrs. Finnemore, who was again distraught and overcome. Sergeant Bolick nodded at the Boones and motioned for them to follow him into the kitchen. They did, and the detective joined them. Bolick glared at Theo and in a low voice said, &#x201c;Did the girl ever mention a relative in prison in California?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; Theo said.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this all about?&#x201d; Mrs. Boone jumped in. She was not about to stand by silently while her son was rudely interrogated. Mr. Boone was ready to pounce, too.</p><p>The detective pulled out an 8" x 10" black-and-white photo, a mug shot of a shady-looking character who gave every indication of being a veteran criminal. Bolick went on, &#x201c;Guy&#x2019;s name is Jack Leeper, a ten-time loser. Distant cousin to May Finnemore, even more distant to April. He grew up around here, drifted away a long time ago, became a career thug, petty thief, drug dealer, and so on. Got busted in California for kidnapping ten years ago, sentenced to life with no parole. Escaped two weeks ago. This afternoon we get a tip that he might be in this area.&#x201d;</p><p>Theo looked at the sinister face of Jack Leeper and felt ill. If this thug had April, then she was in serious trouble.</p><p>Bolick continued, &#x201c;Last night around seven thirty, Leeper here walks into the Korean Quick Shop four blocks away, buys cigarettes and beer, gets his face captured on the surveillance cameras. Not the smartest crook in the world. So, we know he&#x2019;s definitely in the area.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why would he take April?&#x201d; Theo blurted, his mouth dry with fear, his knees ready to buckle.</p><p>&#x201c;According to authorities in California, they found some letters from April in his prison cell. She was his pen pal, probably felt sorry for the guy &#x2019;cause he&#x2019;s never supposed to get out of prison. So she strikes up a correspondence. We&#x2019;ve searched her room upstairs and can&#x2019;t find anything he may have written to her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She never mentioned this to you?&#x201d; the detective asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Never,&#x201d; Theo said. He had learned that with April&#x2019;s weird family there were many secrets, many things she kept to herself.</p><p>The detective put away the photo, and Theo was relieved. He never wanted to see the face again, but he doubted if he could ever forget it.</p><p>Sergeant Bolick said, &#x201c;We suspect that April knew the person who took her. How else can you explain the lack of a forcible entry?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think he would hurt her?&#x201d; Theo asked.</p><p>&#x201c;We have no way of knowing that, Theo.

She&#x2019;ll find a way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then, please let us know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me, Officer,&#x201d; Mrs. Boone said. &#x201c;But I thought in a case like this you first investigate the parents. Missing children are almost always taken by one of their parents, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is correct,&#x201d; Bolick said. &#x201c;And we are looking for the father. According to the mother, though, she spoke with him yesterday afternoon and he was with his band somewhere in West Virginia. She feels rather strongly that he is not involved in this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;April can&#x2019;t stand her father,&#x201d; Theo blurted, then wished he&#x2019;d remained quiet.</p><p>They chatted for a few more minutes, but the conversation was obviously over. The officers thanked the Boones for coming and promised to check back later. Both Mr. and Mrs. Boone said they would be at their office all day if they were needed for anything. Theo, of course, would be in school.</p><p>As they drove away, Mrs. Boone said, &#x201c;That poor child. Snatched from her own bedroom.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Boone, who was driving, glanced back over his shoulder and said, &#x201c;Are you okay, Theo?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course he&#x2019;s not okay, Woods. His friend has just been abducted.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can speak for myself, Mom,&#x201d; Theo said.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you can, dear. I just hope they find her, and soon.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a hint of sunlight to the east. As they drove through the residential neighborhood, Theo stared out of his window, searching for the hardened face of Jack Leeper. But no one was out there. Lights in homes were being turned on. The town was waking up.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost six,&#x201d; Mr. Boone announced. &#x201c;I say we go to Gertrude&#x2019;s and have her world-famous waffles. Theo?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in,&#x201d; Theo replied, though he had no appetite.</p><p>&#x201c;Marvelous, honey,&#x201d; Mrs. Boone said, though all three knew she would have nothing but coffee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gertrude&#x2019;s was an old diner on Main Street, six blocks west of the courthouse and three blocks south of the police station. It claimed to serve pecan waffles that were famous around the world, but Theo had often doubted this. Did people in Japan and Greece really know about Gertrude and her waffles? He wasn&#x2019;t so sure. He had friends at school who&#x2019;d never heard of Gertrude&#x2019;s right there in Strattenburg. A few miles west of town, on the main highway, there was an ancient log cabin with a gas pump out front and a large sign advertising Dudley&#x2019;s World-Famous Mint Fudge. When Theo was younger, he naturally had assumed that everybody in town not only craved the mint fudge but talked about it nonstop. How else could it achieve the status of being world famous? Then one day in class the discussion took an odd turn and found its way to the topic of imports and exports. Theo made the observation that Mr. Dudley and his mint fudge were heavy into exports because they were so famous. It said so right there on the billboard. To his astonishment, only one other classmate had ever heard of this fudge. Slowly, Theo realized that it probably was not as well known as Mr. Dudley claimed it to be. Slowly, he began to grasp the concept of false advertising.</p><p>Since then, he&#x2019;d been very suspicious of such big claims of notoriety.</p><p>But on this morning he couldn&#x2019;t dwell on waffles and fudge, famous or not. He was far too occupied with thoughts of April and the slimy figure of Jack Leeper. The Boones were seated at a small table in the crowded diner. The air was thick with bacon grease and strong coffee, and the hot topic, as Theo realized not long after he sat down, was the abduction of April Finnemore.

But when their beloved Laura&#x2019;s wedding takes place a year later, Griffin is caught between chauffeuring his mother&#x2019;s and father&#x2019;s ashes in two urns and contending with Joy and her large, unruly family. Both he and she have also brought dates along. How in the world could this have happened?<br>&nbsp;<br>By turns hilarious, rueful, and uplifting, <b>That Old Cape Magic</b> is a profoundly involving novel about marriage, family, and all the other ties that bind.</p><p><strong>Book Description</strong><br> Following <em>Bridge of Sighs</em>&#x2014;a national best seller hailed by <em>The Boston Globe</em> as &#x201c;an astounding achievement&#x201d; and &#x201c;a masterpiece&#x201d;&#x2014;Richard Russo gives us the story of a marriage, and of all the other ties that bind, from parents and in-laws to children and the promises of youth.<br> <p>Griffin has been tooling around for nearly a year with his father&#x2019;s ashes in the trunk, but his mother is very much alive and not shy about calling on his cell phone. She does so as he drives down to Cape Cod, where he and his wife, Joy, will celebrate the marriage of their daughter Laura&#x2019;s best friend. For Griffin this is akin to driving into the past, since he took his childhood summer vacations here, his parents&#x2019; respite from the hated Midwest. And the Cape is where he and Joy honeymooned, in the course of which they drafted the Great Truro Accord, a plan for their lives together that&#x2019;s now thirty years old and has largely come true. He&#x2019;d left screenwriting and Los Angeles behind for the sort of New England college his snobby academic parents had always aspired to in vain; they&#x2019;d moved into an old house full of character; and they&#x2019;d started a family. Check, check and check.</p> <p>But be careful what you pray for, especially if you manage to achieve it. By the end of this perfectly lovely weekend, the past has so thoroughly swamped the present that the future suddenly hangs in the balance. And when, a year later, a far more important wedding takes place, their beloved Laura&#x2019;s, on the coast of Maine, Griffin&#x2019;s chauffeuring two urns of ashes as he contends once more with Joy and her large, unruly family, and both he and she have brought dates along. How in the world could this have happened?</p> <p><em>That Old Cape Magic</em> is a novel of deep introspection and every family feeling imaginable, with a middle-aged man confronting his parents and their failed marriage, his own troubled one, his daughter&#x2019;s new life and, finally, what it was he thought he wanted and what in fact he has. The storytelling is flawless throughout, moments of great comedy and even hilarity alternating with others of rueful understanding and heart-stopping sadness, and its ending is at once surprising, uplifting and unlike anything this Pulitzer Prize winner has ever written.</p> <p></p> <strong>A Q&amp;A with Richard Russo</strong><br> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Apparently there is a wedding phenomenon you have termed "Table 17." What exactly is that and how does it relate to this novel?</p> <p><strong>Richard Russo:</strong> A few years ago my wife and I were invited to a wedding and were seated at what was clearly a "leftover" table. It reminded me of the final teams who get into the NCAA tournament. You can tell by their seeding that they were the last ones in, that they almost didn't make the grade. Table 17 works thematically in the novel because being among strangers, not sure whether you belong, may be the main character's future if he can't find a way to slow his downward spiral.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> You have said that <em>That Old Cape Magic</em> began as a short story. What was the moment you knew it was calling out to be a novel?</p> <p><strong>Richard Russo:</strong> Griffin, my main character, begins the story on his way to a wedding with his father's urn in the trunk of his car. I planned for him to scatter the ashes (his past), put his future in danger at the wedding (his present) and then pull back from disaster at the last moment. But then he pulled over to the side of the road in his convertible to take a phone call from his mother, at the end of which a seagull sh**s on him. At that moment, in part because Griffin blames her, he and I both had a sinking feeling. You can resolve thematic issues of past, present and future in a twenty page story, but if you allow a sh**ting seagull into it, you&#x2019;ve suddenly moved on to something much larger.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why did you choose the Cape?</p> <p><strong>Richard Russo:</strong> For some time I've been fascinated with the idea of "a finer place" (see Lucy Lynch and Bobby Marconi in <em>Bridge of Sighs</em>). I'm talking about both fiction and real life. Why do people believe that happiness is more likely to find you in one place than another? It has something with what you can and can't afford, what you think you'll one day be able to swing if things go well. Except that even when they go well, you discover it's still unaffordable, which gives the desired place a magical quality. The faster you run toward it, the faster it runs away from you. I chose the Cape because it's always been expensive and just keeps getting more so, but it could have been any number of similar places. For Griffin's parents, two academics, a house on the Cape would have always been just beyond their reach. One of their many dubious genetic gifts to Griffin is a sense that happiness is always on the horizon, never where you're standing. Very American, I think.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>That Old Cape Magic</em> is book ended by two weddings and becomes the story of Griffin's own marriage as well as that of his parents and the impending one of his daughter. Is there some loaded charge to weddings that unleashes the past and threatens the future in a way unlike other events? Or, in other words, what were you up to in framing your story with two weddings?</p> <p><strong>Richard Russo:</strong> It probably won't surprise readers to discover that both my daughters were married during the time I was writing this book, which, if it does well, will pay for their weddings. One of our girls was married in London, which except for the expense made things easier on my wife and me. Living in the states, how much could we really be blamed for things that went wrong so far from home? Our other daughter was married in the coastal Maine town where we live, and her wedding was therefore larger. My wife and I feared that our families, who were largely unknown to each other and living on opposite sides of the country (not to mention the political spectrum), might be fissionable. Mostly we feared for the family of the groom, and maybe even the town, since we hoped to continue living there. In the second wedding of That Old Cape Magic I imagined an absolutely catastrophic wedding in hopes it might act as a talisman against real-life disaster, which it appears to have done.</p> <p>Planning your children's weddings also gets you thinking back to your own and making the inevitable comparisons. My wife and I were grad-student poor when we got married in Tucson, and our parents were only marginally better off. Our honeymoon was four days in Mexico. We'd booked the sleeper car but managed to arrive late, actually jumping onto the moving train. They'd given our sleeper to someone else and we had to sit in the aisles on our luggage for several hours until seats became available. Neither of us got a wink of sleep and, naturally, when we arrived in Mazatlan early the next morning, our room wasn't ready. We changed into bathing suits, went to the beach and immediately fell asleep under the brutal tropical sun. By the time we woke up we were burned so badly we couldn't touch each other for the rest of the trip. But we were young and the tacos were good and so was the tequila and we'd brought plenty of books and we talked about our future and who we'd be in that future, and pretty damn quick it was thirty-five years later. That's just about how long the Griffins have been married when <em>That Old Cape Magic</em> opens.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Griffin's parents, both academics trapped in what they call the "mid f***ing west," are such wonderful, sometimes maddening, often hilarious, always surprising characters. You've mined the satiric potential of academia before, most notably in <em>Straight Man</em>. Have you been longing to go back there?</p> <p><strong>Richard Russo:</strong> I thought I'd got all the academic satire out of my system with <em>Straight Man</em>, but apparently not. Actually, since writing that novel I've entered another world&#x2014;movie making&#x2014;that would be equally idiotic except that instead of academic scrip it involves real money. In this novel, because Griffin's a former screenwriter, I got to compare lunacies. It wasn't a fair fight, of course. Academics are really the only ones in their weight class (heavy).</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> At the start of the novel Griffin is a man in his mid fifties who seemingly has everything going for him, a great marriage, a great daughter, the career he aspired to, basically everything he had on his wish list when first venturing out in adulthood. Then, within a year, he watches it all come unglued. It&#x2019;s amazing how quickly that can happen, no?</p> <p><strong>Richard Russo:</strong> That's the other similarity between this book and <em>Straight Man</em>. In both novels we watch men who are tenured in life. Safe, in other words. But there's just this one little thread on the sweater. You know you should clip it, not pull it, but there are no scissors at hand and what's the worst that can happen? The answer to that question, in this instance, is <em>That Old Cape Magic</em>.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Have you actually ever been to a wedding where a guest was trapped in a tree?</p> <p><strong>Richard Russo:</strong> I myself have never been to a wedding where a guest got stuck in a tree, but we're attending a wedding on the Cape this summer and I have high hopes.</p> (Photo � Elena Seibert)<b>Richard Russo</b> lives with his wife in Camden, Maine, and in Boston.

Historically significant for its portrayal of a slave rebellion and of the practice of obeah, Obi is also a fast-paced and lively novel, blending religion, politics, and romance. </p> <p> This Broadview edition includes a critical introduction and a selection of contemporary documents, including historical and literary treatments of obeah and accounts of an eighteenth-century slave rebellion. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Srinivas Aravamudan</strong> teaches eighteenth-century literature and post-colonial studies at Duke University, where he is the director of the John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute.

Among the stories are 'The Depressed Person,' a dazzling and blackly humorous portrayal of a woman's mental state; 'Adult World,' which reveals a woman's agonized consideration of her confusing sexual relationship with her husband; and 'Brief Interviews with Hideous Men,' a dark, hilarious series of imagined interviews with men on the subject of their relations with women.<br>Wallace delights in leftfield observation, mining the absurd, the surprising, and the illuminating from every situation. This collection will enthrall DFW fans, and provides a perfect introduction for new readers.</p><p>Amid the screams of adulation for bandanna-clad wunderkind David Foster Wallace, you might hear a small peep. It is the cry for some restraint. On occasion the reader is left in the dust wondering where the story went, as the author, literary turbochargers on full-blast, suddenly accelerates into the wild-blue-footnoted yonder in pursuit of some obscure metafictional fancy. <i>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</i>, Wallace's latest collection, is at least in part a response to the distress signal put out by the many readers who <i>want</i> to ride along with him, if he'd only slow down for a second.<p> The intellectual gymnastics and ceaseless rumination endure (if you don't have a tolerance for that kind of thing, your nose doesn't belong in this book), but they are for the most part couched in simpler, less frenzied narratives. The book's four-piece namesake takes the form of interview transcripts, in which the conniving horror that is the male gender is revealed in all of its licentious glory. In the short, two-part "The Devil Is a Busy Man," Wallace strolls through the Hall of Mirrors that is human motivation. (Is it possible to completely rid an act of generosity of any self-serving benefits? And why is it easier to sell a couch for five dollars than it is to give it away for free?) The even shorter glimpse into modern-day social ritual, "A Radically Condensed History of Postindustrial Life," stretches the seams of its total of seven lines with scathing economy: "She laughed extremely hard, hoping to be liked. Then each drove home alone, staring straight ahead, with the very same twist to their faces." Wallace also imbues his extreme observational skills with a haunting poetic sensibility. Witness what he does to a diving board and the two darkened patches at the end of it in "Forever Overhead": </p><blockquote> It's going to send you someplace which its own length keeps you from seeing, which seems wrong to submit to without even thinking.... They are skin abraded from feet by the violence of the disappearance of people with real weight. </blockquote> Of course, not every piece is an absolute winner. "The Depressed Person" slips from purposefully clinical to unintentionally boring. "Tri-Stan: I Sold Sissee Nar to Ecko" reimagines an Arthurian tale in MTV terms and holds your attention for about as long as you'd imagine from such a description. Ultimately, however, even these failed experiments are a testament to Mr. Wallace's endless if unbridled talent. Once he gets the reins completely around that sucker, it's going to be quite a ride. <i>--Bob Michaels</i>David Foster Wallace has made an art of taking readers into places no other writer even gets near. In this exuberantly acclaimed collection he combines hilarity and an escalating disquiet in stories that astonish, entertain, and expand our ideas of the pleasures that fiction can afford.</p><h2>Berlin Stories (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>A New York Review Books Original<br><br>In 1905 the young Swiss writer Robert Walser arrived in Berlin to join his older brother Karl, already an important stage-set designer, and immediately threw himself into the vibrant social and cultural life of the city. <i>Berlin Stories </i>collects his alternately celebratory, droll, and satirical observations on every aspect of the bustling German capital, from its theaters, cabarets, painters&#x2019; galleries, and literary salons, to the metropolitan street, markets, the Tiergarten, rapid-service restaurants, and the electric tram. Originally appearing in literary magazines as well as the feuilleton sections of newspapers, the early stories are characterized by a joyous urgency and the generosity of an unconventional guide. Later pieces take the form of more personal reflections on the writing process, memories, and character studies. All are full of counter-intuitive images and vignettes of startling clarity, showcasing a unique talent for whom no detail was trivial, at grips with a city diving headlong into modernity.</p><p>ROBERT WALSER (1878&#x2013;1956) was born into a German-speaking family in Biel, Switzerland. He left school at fourteen and led a wandering, precarious existence while writing his poems, novels, and vast numbers of the &#x201c;prose pieces&#x201d; that became his hallmark. In 1933 he was confined to a sanatorium, which marked the end of his writing career. Among Walser&#x2019;s works available in English are<i> Jakob von Gunten</i> (available as an NYRB classic), <i>The Tanners</i>, <i>Microscripts, The Assistant, The Robber, Masquerade and Other Stories</i>, and <i>Speaking to the Rose: Writings, 1912&#x2013;1932</i>.<br><br>JOCHEN GREVEN is the author of first German-language PhD dissertation on Robert Walser and the editor of Walser&#x2019;s collected works in German. As a graduate student in the 1950s, he recognized that Walser&#x2019;s &#x201c;microscripts&#x201d; (manuscript pages covered with tiny handwriting discovered after Walser&#x2019;s death) were not written in secret code but were in fact literary texts in standard German. Greven has devoted more than fifty years to studying and editing Walser&#x2019;s work.<br><br>SUSAN BERNOFSKY is the translator of six books by Robert Walser as well as works by Jenny Erpenbeck, Yoko Tawada, Hermann Hesse, Gregor von Rezzori, and others. The current chair of the PEN Translation Committee, she teaches in the MFA Program in Creative Writing and Literary Translation at Queens College (CUNY) and is at work on a biography of Walser.&#x201c;If ever a writer deserved the clich� that they have a voice all of their own, it&#x2019;s Walser.

Robert Walser&#x2019;s work often reads like a dazzling answer to the question, How immense can modesty be? If Emily Dickinson made cathedrals of em dashes and capital letters and the angle of winter light, Walser accomplishes the feat with, well, ladies&#x2019; feet and trousers, and little emotive words like joy, uncapitalized.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Rivka Galchen, <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i><br><br>&#x201c;Walser&#x2019;s fictions are charged with compassion: awareness of the creatureliness of life, of the fellowship of sadness.

He has stepped into the vortex of a culture in upheaval: drugs that frighten him, a sexuality that consumes him, a music he doesn&#39;t understand. He&#39;s come to Hollywood to pursue his obsession with film, only to find a Hollywood that&#39;s as indifferent to film as it is to Vikar.</p><p><p>"Erickson is as unique and vital and pure a voice as American fiction has produced."--Jonathan Lethem</p>A film-obsessed ex-seminarian with images of Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift tattooed on his head arrives on Hollywood Boulevard in 1969. Vikar Jerome enters the vortex of a cultural transformation: rock and roll, sex, drugs, and--most important to him--the decline of the movie studios and the rise of independent directors. Jerome becomes a film editor of astonishing vision. Through encounters with former starlets, burglars, political guerillas, punk musicians, and veteran filmmakers, he discovers the secret that lies in every movie ever made.<p></p> <p> <strong>Questions for Steve Erickson</strong> </p><p> <strong>Jeff VanderMeer for Amazon.com:</strong> Could you describe where you are as you're answering these questions? </p><p> <strong>Erickson:</strong> At the moment I'm in my home office in Topanga Canyon, which I can see outside my window. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> How do you feel your fiction has changed over the years, beyond the changes that occur from acquiring greater mastery of technique? </p><p> <strong>Erickson:</strong> Well, being a novelist yourself, you probably understand this is something it's better for a writer not to think too much about. While I do believe I become a technically better writer over time, in others ways writing gets harder because inspiration is finite. On the other hand, though energy and inspiration diminish, experience grows--the theme of parents and kids, for instance, which lurked under the surface in earlier novels like <i>Days Between Stations</i> and <i>Rubicon Beach</i> and <i>Arc d'X</i>, has come to the forefront over the course of my last three novels including <i>Zeroville</i>, just because my own personal experience has become more first-hand. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Because you've got more ways to tell a story now than when you were first published, does that also make it harder to write? Do you ever find yourself debating the merits of more than one approach to the same material? </p><p> <strong>Erickson:</strong> The material dictates the approach. I tell the stories in the way that feels natural to tell them. Certainly the last thing I want is to be "difficult." In my previous novel, <i>Our Ecstatic Days</i>, a lake has flooded Los Angeles and a young single mother believes it represents the chaos of the world that has come to take her small son. She dives down into the water to the hole at the bottom through which the lake is coming--and at the moment I wrote that scene, I had this idea she should "swim" through the rest of the novel, through the next 25 years of the story, and the reader sees this in the form of a single sentence that cuts through the rest of the text. A lot of people identified this as "experimental," but to me experimental fiction ultimately is about the experiment and I'm not interested in experiments for their own sake, and if anything I've always steered a bit clear of that kind of thing, because it seems gimmicky to play around with text rather than do the work of telling a story and creating characters. In the case of <i>Our Ecstatic Days</i>, it was just a way of conveying the world of that particular novel. A number of people have noted that <i>Zeroville</i> is more "linear" than the earlier novels but that was calculated only in the sense that I thought a novel about the Movies and why we love them (as opposed to a "Hollywood novel" about the movie business) should have the pop energy of a movie. People have mentioned how fast <i>Zeroville</i> reads--that's because I felt it should move the way a movie moves. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What really sparked <i>Zeroville</i>? Was there a moment where you suddenly realized you had a story to tell? </p><p> <strong>Erickson:</strong> The idea was born in a short story I wrote for a <i>McSweeney's</i> anthology, but the novel really fell into place when the character of Vikar came into focus, when I got a handle on this guy who shows up in Hollywood in 1969 on what happens to be the day of the Manson murders, with a scene from George Stevens's <i>A Place in the Sun</i> tattooed on his head. He's identified by one of the other characters in the novel as not a cineaste but "cineautistic"--movies have become his religion after he's rejected the one his father imposed on him, and he sees movies through the eyes of an innocent. Once I had Vikar I had everything--the story, the approach, the perspective, the tone. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> How difficult was it to layer in all of the movie information that's in <i>Zeroville</i>? For example, you include several real movie people in the novel, sometimes anonymously so the reader has to guess who they are. Was that all there in the initial drafts? </p><p> <strong>Erickson:</strong> The whole novel wrote itself from beginning to end, including the film stuff. It was the easiest novel I've written. I almost feel like I can't take credit for it--it was like the universe said, Here, you worked pretty hard on all those other books, so we're giving you this one. You type, I'll dictate. If anything, when I went back over the novel, I took film stuff out. The stuff about movies had to support the story, it had to support the characters and be informed by them -- the novel couldn't just be a compendium of movies I happen to like. It's not a DVD guide. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Did you know going in that this was going to be a very funny novel? And do you think reviewers have, in the past, missed elements of humor in your work, or is this new for you? </p><p> <strong>Erickson:</strong> I knew it was going to be funny once I knew who Vikar was. Once I knew we were going to tell the story pretty much from his vantage point, it couldn't help being funny. There are moments of humor in earlier novels like <i>Tours of the Black Clock</i> and <i>The Sea Came in at Midnight</i> that probably are so dry and dark that some people didn't understand they were funny. But with the exception of <i>Amnesiascope</i>, which generally is considered a funny novel, the humor usually hasn't been this overt. </p><p></p><b>Steve Erickson </b>is the author of several novels, including <i>Tours of the Black Clock</i>, <i>Rubicon Beach</i>, <i>The Sea Came in at Midnight</i>, <i>Our Ecstatic Days</i> and <i>Arc d'X</i>.

He stood two inches over six feet tall and had a lean, athletic build that even loose-fit jeans and a T-shirt couldn&#x2019;t conceal. The color of his hair gave midnight a run for its money, with eyes to match. His smile was sexy and warned of trouble, but I&#x2019;d made up my mind that not all trouble was bad.<br> <br>Overhead, fireworks lit up the night sky, raining streams of color into the Atlantic. The crowd oohed and aahed. It was late June, and Maine was jumping into summer with both feet, celebrating the beginning of two months of sun, sand, and tourists with deep pockets. I was celebrating two months of sun, sand, and plenty of exclusive time with Patch. I&#x2019;d enrolled in one summer school course&#x2014;chemistry&#x2014;and had every intention of letting Patch monopolize the rest of my free time.<br> <br>The fire department was setting off the fireworks on a dock that couldn&#x2019;t have been more than two hundred yards down the beach from where we stood, and I felt the boom of each one vibrate in the sand under my feet. Waves crashed into the beach just down the hill, and carnival music tinkled at top volume. The smell of cotton candy, popcorn, and sizzling meat hung thick in the air, and my stomach reminded me I hadn&#x2019;t eaten since lunch.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to grab a cheeseburger,&#x201d; I told Patch. &#x201c;Want anything?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing on the menu.&#x201d;<br> <br>I smiled. &#x201c;Why, Patch, are you flirting with me?&#x201d;<br> <br>He kissed the crown of my head. &#x201c;Not yet. I&#x2019;ll grab your cheeseburger. Enjoy the last of the fireworks.&#x201d;<br> <br>I snagged one of his belt loops to stop him. &#x201c;Thanks, but I&#x2019;m ordering. I can&#x2019;t take the guilt.&#x201d;<br> <br>He raised his eyebrows in inquiry.<br> <br>&#x201c;When was the last time the girl at the hamburger stand let you pay for food?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a while.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been never. Stay here. If she sees you, I&#x2019;ll spend the rest of the night with a guilty conscience.&#x201d;<br> <br>Patch opened his wallet and pulled out a twenty. &#x201c;Leave her a nice tip.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was my turn to raise my eyebrows. &#x201c;Trying to redeem yourself for all those times you took free food?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Last time I paid, she chased me down and shoved the money in my pocket. I&#x2019;m trying to avoid another groping.&#x201d;<br> <br>It sounded made up, but knowing Patch, it was probably true.<br> <br>I hunted down the end of a long line that wrapped around the hamburger stand, finding it near the entrance to the indoor carousel. Judging by the size of the line, I estimated a fifteen-minute wait just to place my order. One hamburger stand on the entire beach. It felt un-American.<br> <br>After a few minutes of restless waiting, I was taking what must have been my tenth bored look around when I spotted Marcie Millar standing two spots back. Marcie and I had gone to school together since kindergarten, and in the eleven years since, I&#x2019;d seen more of her than I cared to remember. Because of her, the whole school had seen more of my underwear than necessary. In junior high, Marcie&#x2019;s usual MO was stealing my bra from my gym locker and pinning it to the bulletin board outside the main offices, but occasionally she got creative and used it as a centerpiece in the cafeteria&#x2014;both my A cups filled with vanilla pudding and topped with maraschino cherries. Classy, I know. Marcie&#x2019;s skirts were two sizes too small and five inches too short. Her hair was strawberry blond, and she had the shape of a Popsicle stick&#x2014;turn her sideways and she practically disappeared. If there was a scoreboard keeping track of wins and losses between us, I was pretty sure Marcie had double my score.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I said, unintentionally catching her eye and not seeing any way around a bare-minimum greeting.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; she returned in what scraped by as a civil tone.<br> <br>Seeing Marcie at Delphic Beach tonight was like playing What&#x2019;s Wrong with This Picture? Marcie&#x2019;s dad owned the Toyota dealership in Coldwater, her family lived in an upscale hillside neighborhood, and the Millars took pride in being the only citizens of Coldwater welcomed into the prestigious Harraseeket Yacht Club. At this very minute, Marcie&#x2019;s parents were probably in Freeport, racing sailboats and ordering salmon.<br> <br>By contrast, Delphic was a slum beach. The thought of a yacht club was laughable. The sole restaurant came in the form of a whitewashed hamburger stand with your choice of ketchup or mustard. On a good day, fries were offered in the mix. The entertainment slanted toward loud arcades and bumper cars, and after dark, the parking lot was known to sell more drugs than a pharmacy.<br> <br>Not the kind of atmosphere Mr. and Mrs. Millar would have their daughter polluting herself in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Could we move any slower, people?&#x201d; Marcie called up the line. &#x201c;Some of us are starving to death back here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s only one person working the counter,&#x201d; I told her.<br> <br>&#x201c;So? They should hire more people. Supply and demand.&#x201d;<br> <br>Given her GPA, Marcie was the last person who should be spouting economics.<br> <br>Ten minutes later, I&#x2019;d made progress, and stood close enough to the hamburger stand to read the word MUSTARD scribbled in black Magic Marker on the communal yellow squirt bottle. Behind me, Marcie did the whole shifting-weight-between-hips-and-sighing thing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Starving with a capital S,&#x201d; she complained.<br> <br>The guy in line ahead of me paid and carried off his food.<br> <br>&#x201c;A cheeseburger and a Coke,&#x201d; I told the girl working the stand.<br> <br>While she stood over the grill making my order, I turned back to Marcie. &#x201c;So. Who are you here with?&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t particularly care who she&#x2019;d come with, especially since we didn&#x2019;t share any of the same friends, but my sense of courtesy got the better of me. Besides, Marcie hadn&#x2019;t done anything overtly rude to me in weeks. And we&#x2019;d stood in relative peace the past fifteen minutes. Maybe it was the beginning of a truce. Bygones and all that.<br> <br>She yawned, as if talking to me was more boring than waiting in line and staring at the backs of people&#x2019;s heads. &#x201c;No offense, but I&#x2019;m not in a chatty mood. I&#x2019;ve been in line for what feels like five hours, waiting on an incompetent girl who obviously can&#x2019;t cook two hamburgers at once.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl behind the counter had her head ducked low, concentrating on peeling premade hamburger patties from the wax paper, but I knew she&#x2019;d heard. She probably hated her job. She probably secretly spat on the hamburger patties when she turned her back. I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if at the end of her shift, she went out to her car and wept.<br> <br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t your dad mind that you&#x2019;re hanging out at Delphic Beach?&#x201d; I asked Marcie, narrowing my eyes ever so slightly. &#x201c;Might tarnish the estimable Millar family reputation. Especially now that your dad&#x2019;s been accepted into the Harraseeket Yacht Club.&#x201d;<br> <br>Marcie&#x2019;s expression cooled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised your dad doesn&#x2019;t mind you&#x2019;re here. Oh, wait. That&#x2019;s right. He&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>My initial reaction was shock. My second was indignation at her cruelty. A knot of anger swelled in my throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; she argued with a one-shoulder shrug. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead. It&#x2019;s a fact. Do you want me to lie about the facts?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What did I ever do to you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You were born.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her complete lack of sensitivity yanked me inside out&#x2014;so much so that I didn&#x2019;t even have a comeback. I snatched my cheeseburger and Coke off the counter, leaving the twenty in its place. I wanted badly to hurry back to Patch, but this was between me and Marcie. If I showed up now, one look at my face would tell Patch something was wrong. I didn&#x2019;t need to drag him into the middle. Taking a moment alone to collect myself, I found a bench within sight of the hamburger stand and sat down as gracefully as I could, not wanting to give Marcie the power to ruin my night. The only thing that could make this moment worse was knowing she was watching, satisfied she&#x2019;d stuffed me into a little black hole of self-pity. I took a bite of cheeseburger, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. All I could think of was dead meat. Dead cows. My own dead father.<br> <br>I threw the cheeseburger into the trash and kept walking, feeling tears slip down the back of my throat.<br> <br>Hugging my arms tightly at the elbows, I hurried toward the shack of bathrooms at the edge of the parking lot, hoping to make it behind a stall door before the tears started falling. There was a steady line trickling out of the women&#x2019;s room, but I edged my way through the doorway and positioned myself in front of one of the grime-coated mirrors. Even under the low-watt bulb, I could tell my eyes were red and glassy. I wet a paper towel and pressed it to my eyes. What was Marcie&#x2019;s problem? What had I ever done to her that was cruel enough to deserve this?<br> <br>Drawing a few stabilizing breaths, I squared my shoulders and constructed a brick wall in my mind, placing Marcie on the far side of it. What did I care what she said? I didn&#x2019;t even like her. Her opinion meant nothing. She was rude and self-centered and attacked below the belt. She didn&#x2019;t know me, and she definitely didn&#x2019;t know my dad. Crying over a single word that fell from her mouth was a waste.<br> <br>Get over it, I told myself.<br> <br>I waited until the red rimming my eyes faded before leaving the restroom. I roamed the crowd, looking for Patch, and found him at one of the ball toss games, his back to me. Rixon was at his side, probably wagering money on Patch&#x2019;s inability to knock over a single weighted bowling pin. Rixon was a fallen angel who had a long history with Patch, and their ties ran deep to the point of brotherhood. Patch didn&#x2019;t let many people into his life, and trusted even fewer, but if there was one person who knew all his secrets, it was Rixon.<br> <br>Up until two months ago, Patch had also been a fallen angel. Then he saved my life, earned his wings back, and became my guardian angel. He was supposed to play for the good guys now, but I secretly sensed that his connection to Rixon, and the world of fallen angels, meant more to him. And even though I didn&#x2019;t want to admit it, I sensed that he regretted the archangels&#x2019; decision to make him my guardian. After all, it wasn&#x2019;t what he wanted.<br> <br>He wanted to become human.<br> <br>My cell phone rang, jarring me from my thoughts. It was my best friend Vee&#x2019;s ringtone, but I let voice mail take her call. With a squeeze of guilt, I vaguely noted it was the second call of hers I&#x2019;d avoided today. I justified my guilt with the thought that I&#x2019;d see her first thing tomorrow. Patch, on the other hand, I wouldn&#x2019;t see again until tomorrow evening. I planned to enjoy every minute I had with him.<br> <br>I watched him pitch the ball at a table neatly lined with six bowling pins, my stomach giving a little flutter when his T-shirt crept up in the back, revealing a stripe of skin. I knew from experience that every inch of him was hard, defined muscle. His back was smooth and perfect too, the scars from when he&#x2019;d fallen once again replaced with wings&#x2014;wings I, and every other human, couldn&#x2019;t see.<br> <br>&#x201c;Five dollars says you can&#x2019;t do it again,&#x201d; I said, coming up behind him.<br> <br>Patch looked back and grinned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want your money, Angel.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey now, kids, let&#x2019;s keep this discussion PG-rated,&#x201d; Rixon said.<br> <br>&#x201c;All three remaining pins,&#x201d; I challenged Patch.<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind of prize are we talking about?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bloody hell,&#x201d; Rixon said. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t this wait until you&#x2019;re alone?&#x201d;<br> <br>Patch gave me a secret smile, then shifted his weight back, cradling the ball into his chest. He dropped his right shoulder, brought his arm around, and sent the ball flying forward as hard as he could. There was a loud crack! and the remaining three pins scattered off the table.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, now you&#x2019;re in trouble, lass,&#x201d; Rixon shouted at me over the commotion caused by a pocket of onlookers, who were clapping and whistling for Patch.<br> <br>Patch leaned back against the booth and arched his eyebrows at me. The gesture said it all: Pay up.<br> <br>&#x201c;You got lucky,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m about to get lucky.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Choose a prize,&#x201d; the old man running the booth barked at Patch, bending to pick up the fallen pins.<br> <br>&#x201c;The purple bear,&#x201d; Patch said, and accepted a hideous-looking teddy bear with matted purple fur. He held it out to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;For me?&#x201d; I said, pressing a hand to my heart.<br> <br>&#x201c;You like the rejects. At the grocery store, you always take the dented cans. I&#x2019;ve been paying attention.&#x201d; He hooked his finger in the waistband of my jeans and pulled me close. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get out of here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What did you have in mind?&#x201d; But I was all warm and fluttery inside, because I knew exactly what he had in mind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your place.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook my head. &#x201c;Not going to happen. My mom&#x2019;s home. We could go to your place,&#x201d; I hinted.<br> <br>We&#x2019;d been together two months, and I still didn&#x2019;t know where Patch lived. And not for lack of trying. Two weeks into a relationship seemed long enough to be invited over, especially since Patch lived alone. Two months felt like overkill. I was trying to be patient, but my curiosity kept getting in the way. I knew nothing about the private, intimate details of Patch&#x2019;s life, like the color of paint on his walls. If his can opener was electric or manual. The brand of soap he showered with. If his sheets were cotton or silk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let me guess,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You live in a secret compound buried in the underbelly of the city.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Angel.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are there dishes in the sink? Dirty underwear on the floor? It&#x2019;s a lot more private than my place.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;True, but the answer&#x2019;s still no.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Has Rixon seen your place?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Rixon is need-to-know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not need-to-know?&#x201d;<br> <br>His mouth twitched. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a dark side to need-to-know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you showed me, you&#x2019;d have to kill me?&#x201d; I guessed.<br> <br>He wrapped his arms around me and kissed my forehead. &#x201c;Close enough. What time&#x2019;s curfew?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ten. Summer school starts tomorrow.&#x201d; That, and my mom had practically taken a part-time job finding opportunities to drop the knife between me and Patch. If I&#x2019;d been out with Vee, I could say with absolute certainty that my curfew would have stretched to ten thirty. I couldn&#x2019;t blame my mom for not trusting Patch&#x2014;there was a point in my life when I&#x2019;d felt similarly&#x2014;but it would have been extremely convenient if every now and then she relaxed her vigilance.<br> <br>Like, say, tonight. Besides, nothing was going to happen. Not with my guardian angel standing inches away.<br> <br>Patch looked at his watch. &#x201c;Time to roll.&#x201d;<br> <br>At 10:04, Patch flipped a U-turn in front of the farmhouse and parked by the mailbox. He cut the engine and the headlights, leaving us alone in the dark countryside. We sat that way for several moments before he said, &#x201c;Why so quiet, Angel?&#x201d;<br> <br>I instantly snapped to attention. &#x201c;Am I being quiet? Just lost in thought.&#x201d;<br> <br>A barely-there smile curved Patch&#x2019;s mouth. &#x201c;Liar. What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re good,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>His smile widened a fraction. &#x201c;Really good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I ran into Marcie Millar at the hamburger stand,&#x201d; I admitted. So much for keeping my troubles to myself. Obviously they were still smoldering under the surface. On the other hand, if I couldn&#x2019;t talk to Patch, who could I talk to? Two months ago our relationship involved a lot of spontaneous kissing inside our cars, outside our cars, under the bleachers, and on top of the kitchen table. It also involved a lot of wandering hands, tousled hair, and smudged lip gloss. But it was so much more than that now. I felt connected to Patch emotionally. His friendship meant more to me than a hundred casual acquaintances.

As a child, he spent much of his free time in that city&#39;s famous Hagenbeck Zoo drawing animals. After serving in the army during World War I, he studied philology and natural science at the University of Hamburg. He then married Margret Rey and they moved to Montmartre for four years. The manuscript for the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and Curious George was published in 1941. Curious George has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G. AND THE NINE MONKEYS and FIND THE CONSTELLATIONS.The ingenious little monkey who left the jungle to live with the man in the yellow hat is at it again. What happens when he sets off on his new bicycle to deliver newspapers is enough to make heads spin. He builds a whole navy of paper boats, lands in a traveling circus as a daring bicycle rider, gets an ostrich into trouble, and rescues a runaway bear.</p><h2>Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life</h2><p>Writing with bracing intelligence and clarity, internationally renowned evolutionist and bestselling author Stephen Jay Gould sheds new light on a dilemma that has plagued thinking people since the Renaissance: the rift between science and religion. Instead of choosing them, Gould asks, why not opt for a golden mean that accords dignity and distinction to each realm?<br><br>In his distinctively elegant style, Gould offers a lucid, contemporary principle that allows science and religion to coexist peacefully in a position of respectful noninterference. Science defines the natural world; religion our moral world in recognition of their separate spheres of influence. In exploring this thought-provoking concept, Gould delves into the history of science, sketching affecting portraits of scientists and moral leaders wrestling with matters of faith and reason. Stories of seminal figures such as Galileo, Darwin, and Thomas Henry Huxley make vivid his argument that individuals and cultures must cultivate both a life of the spirit and a life of rational inquiry in order to experience the fullness of being human.<br><br>In <i>Rocks of Ages</i>, Gould&#x2019;s passionate humanism, ethical discernment, and erudition are fused to create a dazzling gem of contemporary cultural philosophy.</p><p>Revered and eminently readable essayist Stephen Jay Gould has once again rendered the complex simple, this time mending the seeming split between the two "Rocks of Ages," science and religion. He quickly, and rightfully, admits that his thesis is not new, but one broadly accepted by many scientists and theologians. Gould begins by suggesting that Darwin has been misconstrued--that while some religious thinkers have used divinity to prove the impossibility of evolution, Darwin would have never done the reverse.<p> Gould eloquently lays out not "a merely diplomatic solution" to rectify the physical and metaphysical, but "a principled position on moral and intellectual grounds," central to which is the elegant concept of "non-overlapping magisteria." (Gould defines <i>magisteria</i> as a "four-bit" word meaning domain of authority in teaching.) Essentially, science and religion can't be unified, but neither should they be in conflict; each has its own discrete magisteria, the natural world belonging exclusively to science and the moral to religion.</p><p> Gould's argument is both lucid and convincing as he cites past religious and scientific greats (including a particularly touching section on Darwin himself). Regardless of your persuasions, religious or scientific, Gould holds up his end of the conversation with characteristic respect and intelligence. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>&#x201c;Daring and thought-provoking . . .

It was the recipient of six major awards, including the prestigious Hemingway Foundation/PEN award. Now Chang-rae Lee has written a powerful and beautifully crafted second novel that leaves no doubt about the extraordinary depth and range of his talent.<br><br><i>A Gesture Life</i>&nbsp;is the story of a proper man, an upstanding citizen who has come to epitomize the decorous values of his New York suburban town. Courteous, honest, hardworking, and impenetrable, Franklin Hata, a Japanese man of Korean birth, is careful never to overstep his boundaries and to make his neighbors comfortable in his presence. Yet as his story unfolds, precipitated by the small events surrounding him, we see his life begin to unravel. Gradually we learn the mystery that has shaped the core of his being: his terrible, forbidden love for a young Korean Comfort Woman when he served as a medic in the Japanese army during World War II.<br><br>In <i>A Gesture Life</i>, Chang-rae Lee leads us with dazzling control through a taut, suspenseful story about love, family, and community&#x2014;and the secrets we harbor. As in&nbsp;<i>Native Speaker</i>, he writes of the ways outsiders conform in order to survive and the price they pay for doing so. It is a haunting, breathtaking display of talent by an acclaimed young author.</p><p>Never judge a book by its cover--or, for that matter, by its name. Otherwise you might overlook <i>A Gesture Life</i>, Chang-rae Lee's fine if awkwardly entitled follow-up to <i>Native Speaker</i>. As he did in his debut, the author explores the dilemma of being an outsider--and the corrupt, heartbreaking bargains an outsider will make to adapt to his surroundings. The protagonist, Franklin Hata, has actually spent his whole life donning one variety or another of existential camouflage. First, as a native-born Korean, he bends over backwards to fit into Japanese culture, circa 1944. Then he attempts a similar bit of environmental adaptation in postwar America--more specifically, in the slumbering New York suburb of Bedley Run. But in neither case does he quite succeed, which gives the novel its peculiar, faltering sense of tragedy.<p> "There is something exemplary to the sensation of near perfect lightness," confesses this resident alien, "of being in a place and not being there, which seems of course a chronic condition of my life but then, too, its everyday unction, the trouble finding a remedy but not quite a cure, so that the problem naturally proliferates until it has become you through and through. Such is the cast of my belonging, molding to whatever is at hand."</p><p> <i>A Gesture Life</i> presents this chronic condition in two different time frames. In one, delivered via flashback, Hata is a medical officer in Japan's Imperial Army. Posted to a tiny installation in rural Burma, he's ordered to oversee a fresh detachment of Korean "comfort women"--i.e., victims of institutionalized gang rape. At first he maintains his professional distance, not to mention his erotic appetite: "It was the notion of what lay beneath the crumpled cotton of their poor clothes that shook me like an air-raid siren." But soon enough he's drawn into a relationship with one of the women, whose bloody and horrific denouement leaves a permanent mark on the "unblissed detachment" of his existence.</p><p> The present-tense, American half of the story revolves around Hata's life in Bedley Run, where he adopts, alienates, and finally forms a shaky rapport with his daughter, Sunny. We might expect this sort of material to pale in comparison with his wartime trauma. But oddly enough, Hata's suburban melancholia is much more compelling--and the gradual disclosure of his past, which is supposed to ratchet up the tension, seems too crude a mechanism for a writer of Lee's superlative talents. (His truest tutelary spirit, in fact, might be John Cheever, who gets an explicit nod at one point.) None of this is to dismiss <i>A Gesture Life</i>, whose dual narratives are written with a rare, unhurried elegance. And if Lee's splice job lacks the absolute adhesion we expect from a great work of art, he nonetheless pulls off a remarkable, moving feat: he puts us inside the skin of a man who, "if he could choose, might always go silent and unseen." <i>--James Marcus</i></p><b>Chang-rae Lee </b>is the author of&nbsp;<i>Native Speaker</i>, winner of the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award for first fiction,&nbsp;<i>A Gesture Life</i>, <i>Aloft</i>, and <i>The Surrendered</i>, winner of the Dayton Peace Prize and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.

But in recent years, a startling new concept has evolved that places it more firmly than ever in a special position. Known as the Anthropic Cosmological Principle, this collection of ideas holds that the existence of intelligent observers determines the fundamental structure of the Universe. In its most radical version, the Anthropic Principle asserts that "intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe, and once it comes into existence, it will never die out."<br> This wide-ranging and detailed book explores the many ramifications of the Anthropic Cosmological Principle, covering the whole spectrum of human inquiry from Aristotle to Z bosons. Bringing a unique combination of skills and knowledge to the subject, John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler--two of the world's leading cosmologists--cover the definition and nature of life, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and the interpretation of the quantum theory in relation to the existence of observers. The book will be of vital interest to philosophers, theologians, mathematicians, scientists, and historians, as well as to anyone concerned with the connection between the vastness of the universe of stars and galaxies and the existence of life within it on a small planet out in the suburbs of the Milky Way.<br><br></p><p>In their classic work, John Barrow and Frank Tipler examine the question of mankind&#39;s place in the Universe, taking the reader on a tour of many scientific disciplines and offering fascinating insights into issues such as the nature of life, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and the history and fate of our universe.<br><strong>John D.

Chapters focused on humans' relationships with, for instance, animals, vegetation and the universe begin with brief summaries of scientific explanation and continue with relevant myths and accounts of daily rituals of such societies as the Chewong in Malaysia, Alaska's Inuit and the Kayapo of the Amazon.

The interviewees, ranging from major philosophers to renowned scientists, talk candidly with Blackmore about some of the key philosophical issues confronting us in a series of conversations that are revealing, insightful, and stimulating. They ruminate on the nature of consciousness (is it something apart from the brain?) and discuss if it is even possible to understand the human mind. Some of these thinkers say no, but most believe that we will pierce the mystery surrounding consciousness, and that neuroscience will provide the key. Blackmore goes beyond the issue of consciousness to ask other intriguing questions: Is there free will? (A question which yields many conflicted replies, with most saying yes and no.) If not, how does this effect the way you live your life; and more broadly, how has your work changed the way you live?<br>Paired with an introduction and extensive glossary that provide helpful background information, these provocative conversations illuminate how some of the greatest minds tackle some of the most difficult questions about human nature.<br></p><p><br><strong>Susan Blackmore</strong> is a freelance writer, lecturer and broadcaster, and a Visiting Lecturer at the University of the West of England, Bristol.

Can the brain itself comprehend it? Blackmore, a lecturer in psychology at the University of the West of England, poses these and other intriguing questions to some of the top thinkers in philosophy and brain studies. In each interview, the author gets to the heart of the struggle to explain subjective experience in objective, scientific terms. Francis Crick, Daniel Dennett, John Searle, David Chalmers, and others describe the fundamental ideas behind the study of consciousness, including free will, the separation of mind and body, artificial intelligence, and conscious versus unconscious experience."--<em>Science News</em><p></p><br>"Succeeds in providing a very brief survey of the multitude of positions occupied by thinkers in this area....

It provokes all kinds of responses, ranging from jokes about psychedelic drugs to brow-furrowing discourses on life's meaning."-- Richard Lipkin, <em>Scientific</em> <em>American</em><p></p><br>"Are some scientists zombies? That is among the thoughts raised by this diverting collection of interviews with neurobiologists, philosophers and others engaged in the study of the mind...a very efficient overview of contemporary strands of thinking about its subject."--Steven Poole, <em>Guardian</em> <em>Unlimited </em><p></p><br>"Blackmore interrogates 20 mind-body experts--philosophers, neuroscientists, psychologists, and various hybrids. She doesn't stand on ceremony, is persistent, probing, honest about her puzzlements, and happy to defend her own views if the occasion arises, which once or twice creates a bit of friction."-- Tom Clark, Naturalism.org<p></p><br>"One remarkable aspect of the consciousness research field is the lack of agreement on what the key subject matter should be. What is the phenomenon for which we need an explanation? Susan Blackmore begins with these questions in <em>Conversations on Consciousness</em>, a collection of interviews with 21 prominent scientists and philosophers. Their answers introduce the reader to some of the concepts and puzzles at the centre of this field<em>Conversations on Consciousness</em> provides a casual and accessible introduction to the topic.

How is it different from other forms of Christianity, and how did it come to have so many different versions throughout the world? Although originally united by location and a common belief, Anglicanism has gradually lost its pre-eminence as the English state church due to increasing pluralisation and secularization. While there are distinctive themes and emphases that emerge from its early history and theology, there is little sense of unity in Anglicanism today.<br><br>Here, Mark Chapman explores the fascinating history, theology, and structures of Anglicanism, and highlights the diversity of the contemporary church by examining how traditions vary from England and American, from South Africa to Malaysia. Chapman looks at current developments and controversies, such as homosexuality and women priests, and offers thought-provoking suggestions for the future of Anglicanism. Putting the history and development of the religion into context, Chapman reveals what it is that holds Anglicanism together despite the recent crises that threaten to tear it apart.<br></p><p><br><strong>Mark Chapman</strong>, a historian and historical theologian, is Vice-Principal of Ripon College, Oxford.<br></p><h2>The Art of Case Study Research</h2><p><p>This book presents a disciplined, qualitative exploration of case study methods by drawing from naturalistic, holistic, ethnographic, phenomenological and biographic research methods. </p><p>Robert E.

Clear descriptions and exceptional illustrations combine to help students develop a firm understanding of the concepts of anatomy and physiology and to teach them how to use that information. Great care has been taken to select important concepts and to perfectly describe the anatomy of cells, organs, and organ systems. To emphasize the concepts of anatomy and physiology, the Seeley A&amp;P&nbsp;authors provide explanations of how the systems respond to aging, changes in physical activity, and disease, with a special focus on homeostasis and the regulatory mechanisms that maintain it. This text has more clinical content than any other A &amp; P book on the market.</p><p>Dr. Rod Seeley holds a B.S. in Zoolgy from Idaho State University and an M.S. and Ph.D. in Zoology from Utah State University.

Set during the tenth year of the siege of Troy, the poem relates how Troilus - with the help of Criseyde&#39;s wily uncle Pandarus - persuades her to become his lover, only to be betrayed when she is handed over to the Greek camp and yields to Diomede.</p><p>During the great siege of Troy, Troilus, the son of Priam, sees Criseyde and falls in love with her. Later, with the help Pandarus- one of the first great character studies in our literature-Troilus wins her love, only to be betrayed.<b>Geoffrey Chaucer</b> was born in London, the son of a wine-merchant, in about 1342, and as he spent his life in royal government service his career happens to be unusually well documented. By 1357 Chaucer was a page to the wife of Prince Lionel, second son of Edward III, and it was while in the prince's service that Chaucer was ransomed when captured during the English campaign in France in 1359-60. Chaucer's wife Philippa, whom he married c. 1365, was the sister of Katherine Swynford, the mistress (c. 1370) and third wife (1396) of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, whose first wife Blanche (d. 1368) is commemorated in Chaucer's ealrist major poem, <b>The Book of the Duchess</b>.<p>From 1374 Chaucer worked as controller of customs on wool in the port of London, but between 1366 and 1378 he made a number of trips abroad on official business, including two trips to Italy in 1372-3 and 1378. The influence of Chaucer's encounter with Italian literature is felt in the poems he wrote in the late 1370's and early 1380s &#x2013; <b>The House of Fame</b>, <b>The Parliament of Fowls</b> and a version of <b>The Knight's Tale</b> &#x2013; and finds its fullest expression in <b>Troilus and Criseyde</b>.</p><p>In 1386 Chaucer was member of parliament for Kent, but in the same year he resigned his customs post, although in 1389 he was appointed Clerk of the King's Works (resigning in 1391). After finishing <b>Troilus</b> and his translation into English prose of Boethius' <b>De consolatione philosophiae</b>, Chaucer started his <b>Legend of Good Women</b>. In the 1390s he worked on his most ambitious project, <b>The Canterbury Tales</b>, which remained unfinished at his death. In 1399 Chaucer leased a house in the precincts of Westminster Abbey but died in 1400 and was buried in the Abbey.<br>Nevill Coghill (1899&#x2013;1980) held many appointments at Oxford University.

His Aunt Armena had told him to be good and not to bother his father, but he decided that her advice could extend to everyone and everything. It seemed that Nick's brother had the same idea -- Jules never hung around long enough to bother anyone anymore. So the whole family kept on not bothering each other right up until Nick and Jules's dad suddenly decided to get married again. </p><p> Leading his new stepsister up the carpeted stairs, Nick had to keep his jaw clenched to stop himself from shouting. He hated that he had to give up his room and move in with Jules, who snored all night and woke up at the crack of dawn to go surfing. If his father hadn't married his stepmother after only six months of dating, Nick would still have his own room. And he wouldn't be stuck with a bedroom-stealing stepsister. Laurie was almost exactly his age and the biggest, weirdest loser he'd ever met. She bothered everyone. </p><p> Nick thought he was being fair about it, too, because he'd been called a loser and a nerd and a spaz himself. He was eleven, kind of fat, and bad at sports, while Julian shredded waves and made it to state in track. The only thing Nick thought he was really good at was school, and that was mostly about being quiet and following directions. So, okay, he knew he wasn't cool. At least he knew better than to advertise everything lame about himself. Laurie seemed to be proud to be the lamest person alive. </p><p> "What are you thinking about?" Laurie asked him, hugging a box to her chest. Her skirt brushed the floor, making the little bells along the hem jingle. </p><p> Nick cringed and set down another box of her crap on the canopy bed. All the boxes seemed to be labeled unicorns, fairies, or books about unicorns and fairies. A few of them had even bled glitter onto the hall rug. </p><p> "Things I hate," said Nick. </p><p> "Like what?" Laurie tucked a tangle of blond hair behind her ear. Bracelets clattered at her wrists. </p><p> He was tempted to tell her. "Clowns," he said instead. "They creep me out." </p><p> "I hate my name," she told him, like he'd just given her the green light to overshare. "I wish I was called Lauranathana." </p><p> "That's stupid," said Nick. "Everyone would make fun of you." </p><p> "I don't care what people think," Laurie said simply, like she meant it. </p><p> He wanted to snap at her, to tell her that everyone cared what people thought about them, but his dad had told him to be "civil" on moving day. He sighed. "Okay, so what stuff do you like?" </p><p> He looked out of her window at the empty concrete shells of houses going up all around theirs. When it had been his window, he'd liked to watch as workers poured and smoothed foundations and cut planks and nailed them in place. He liked to smell the sawdust and see that his dad's development was finally, really happening. Even though there was still some swampy forest left, soon it would all be cut back and turned into golf courses, swimming pools, and lots of other cool things. Stuff he liked. </p><p> He'd imagined playing out there with other kids, but the construction was behind schedule. Nothing was done. His dad kept complaining about the weather -- it was the hottest summer he could remember. And that, along with the brushfires and water rationing, had everyone on edge. The sun had turned the grass on the front lawn crunchy and brown, and Nicholas's dad hadn't filled the pool in the backyard, even though he usually filled the pools as soon as they were built. Now, with the rainy season about to start, Nick's whole summer was turning out to be as lame as his stepsister. </p><p> "I like all this stuff, I guess." Laurie stacked books onto her white beadboard shelves. They were mostly fantasy and fairy tales, but she'd set aside a big tome that had gold letters and what looked like a hawk on the cover. </p><p> "What's that?" he asked. </p><p> "A field guide. So you can tell which kind of faeries are which. I bet there are a lot around here, since there's so much nature." </p><p> "You don't really believe in that stuff, do you?" He took the book from her and flipped through it. It was filled with paintings and sketches of things that made the hair along his arms stand up. They didn't look like faeries. He flipped to the back. "This isn't some kind of ancient magical text. It's fake. It was published in 2005 in New York." </p><p> "It's a reprint," Laurie told him. </p><p> "Look," he said, turning the book toward her. "It says 'fiction' inside. Explain that." </p><p> "They had to put that there," Laurie said, taking it out of his hands. "So they don't get in trouble or sued. And if you don't believe me, you can ask the authors yourself, since they're signing -- " </p><p> "Hey, kids," Nick's father called from downstairs in that new, cheerful voice he used around Laurie and Charlene. "Lunch!" </p><p> After Nick and Julian's mom died and before their dad decided he needed to impress Charlene and her wacko daughter, lunch had been cold slices of leftover pizza from the night before or, on at least one occasion, a piece of apple pie with cheese melted on it. Now, apparently, it was alphabet soup and bologna sandwiches. With the crusts cut off. Nick wanted to hurl. </p><p> Downstairs in the kitchen, Julian was already sitting at the granite island. Earbud cords hung from his head, and his thumbs jabbed at the game console cradled in his hands. His hair was stiff with salt. He didn't even look up when Nick sat down next to him. </p><p> Laurie still had the stupid book tucked under one arm. "After lunch, I'm going to go look for faeries," she told her mother. </p><p> Charlene smiled mildly. "Maybe Nick can go with you. Show you around the neighborhood." </p><p> Nick scowled at his soup. Charlene was okay, but he wished she wasn't around all the time. And he wished she would stop trying to make him be friends with her daughter. Although Charlene hadn't seemed to figure it out yet, he was willing to ignore them if they'd just ignore him back. </p><p> Laurie took a bowl and crumbled a handful of Goldfish crackers into it, making a mess. It never seemed to matter what Laurie did or how bothersome she was. No one was going to tell her to stop. </p><p> "Faeries," Nick's dad said with a grin, tucking a paper napkin into his collar. "I thought they were only in England. Down here, the palmetto bugs'll get them if the lizards don't." </p><p> Nick snickered. </p><p> "They're not all small, you know," said Laurie. She clearly didn't think his dad's joke was funny, which, in Nick's opinion, only made it funnier. </p><p> "It's too hot to look for anything," Nick said, smiling down at his reflection in the granite. "Especially things that don't exist." </p><p> Nick's dad frowned and then rubbed the bridge of his nose. Maybe he was upset his joke hadn't gone over all that well. "Go help her look. Keep her from getting lost." </p><p> Nick pushed the noodle letters in his soup so they spelled l-a-m-e. Lame. Like his summer. Like his stepsister. Like how he felt as he slurped his soup down and, without saying a thing, followed Laurie out into the yard.

His other honors include the Center for the American Indian&#x2019;s Ambassador Award, the Spur Award for Best Western Novel, and the Navajo Tribal Council Special Friends of the Dineh award. A native of Oklahoma, Tony Hillerman lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, until his death in 2008.</p>Morris (American literature, Pennsylvania State Univ., Erie) conducted 15 interviews between 1988 and 1992 of authors writing primarily of the American West. The interviewees are all "postmodernist" and "postregionalist" in their perspectives, sharing an ambiguous and ambivalent attitude toward place and the mythos that represents it. Some of these writers still look to the past but reinterpret it, such as Ron Hansen, Molly Gloss, and Ivan Doig; others, like William Kittredge, seek to demythologize it. Among the writers interviewed are several female voices (Gloss, Gretel Ehrlich, and Mary Clearman Blew), who offer a new vision of the roles played by women in shaping the American West. All of them yield valuable insights into what direction the new Western literary tradition seems to be headed. Novelist Hillerman's volume, in contrast, is far less weighty. It contains 20 short stories, primarily mystery and detective fiction, such as Marcia Muller's "Forbidden Things" and Karen Kijewski's "Tule Fog," interspersed with an occasional fantastical tale. The fictional landscapes here range from the desolation, silence, and danger of Death Valley, and the small, dying towns of southern Colorado to the sophisticated originality and zaniness of Berkekey, California. Across these pages march university protesters, ranch hands, and Yurok Indians. Together, they give life to a multifaceted landscape that is currently undergoing redefinition, as Morris's volume of interviews amply demonstrates. There is no overlap between the writers in these two works. For this reason, owning both works would give a novice reader of Western literature a useful variety.

He analyses the English Roses in great depth, setting them in their place in history, and describing the early hybridizing work that led to the first varieties. With a broader perspective, he considers how to choose partners for roses in the garden; and a unique, illustrated catalog of more than sixty of the best varieties of English Rose provides a rich reference source. Finally, rose growers will find David Austin's advice on how to grow, prune, and care for their own roses truly invaluable.<br>Throughout the book, Clay Perry's ravishing photographs bring the roses to life, both in colorful close-up and in picturesque garden settings.</p><p>Developed since 1969 by the author, English Roses are hybrids of Old Roses with present-day Hybrid Teas and Floribundas. They generally retain the shape and fragrance of the Old Roses, while keeping the disease resistance and perpetual bloom of the Moderns, although as the illustrations show, there is considerable divergence among individual varieties. Austin tells how he began creating English Roses, describes their characteristics, and suggests how best to use and care for them. The book is rounded off by individual portraits of each variety with specifics of size, fragrance, hardiness, and parentage. A list of suppliers follows. This will probably not be the last word on English Roses, especially on their care, but it is an excellent introduction to this new group of roses, beautifully presented in Perry's photographs. Recommended for larger public libraries and academic collections serving agriculture departments.<br><i>- Molly Newling, Piscataway P.L., N.J.</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.For decades, Austin has devoted his life to the development of exquisite new rose varieties he designates English roses. In a stunning presentation that includes a brief history of roses through the centuries, Austin reveals his process of hybridizing these exciting new plants. Now widely available in the U.S., these are the roses creating real excitement among gardeners looking for superior specimens possessing sublime scent, many-petaled form, and color tempered by subtlety. Austin's beautifully photographed, clearly written guide--offering cultivation requirements, pruning instructions, an extensive portfolio assessing the habit of each English rose type--provides information indispensable to gardeners in general and rose connoisseurs in particular. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>Career of Evil (Cormoran Strike)</h2><p><p>When a mysterious package is delivered to Robin Ellacott, she is horrified to discover that it contains a woman s severed leg.</p><p>Her boss, private detective Cormoran Strike, is less surprised but no less alarmed.

Existence began in zero and out of zero came darkness, and from the darkness came light. Number combined with number, set with set, even as the white light added and divided, separating into colors. And now sound came, a sound like singing, rising and falling in a lost cadence, combining into rich harmonies. From there arose a symphony of number, color, and sound, merging and dividing, swelling and fading, an eternal golden braid. <br>And from this shimmering symphony a single thought began to take form. This thought came into existence gradually, fading in and out, coalescing and growing clearer. As this happened, the symphony of number and sound and light died down, like the surface of a turbulent sea subsiding into a gentle susurrus of water, before vanishing entirely. Only the disembodied thought remained. <br>The thought was: I am. <br> 2 <br> Melissa Shepherd skipped her usual breakfast of a venti mocha and crumble cake and instead drank two glasses of French mineral water. She wanted to go into the day with an empty stomach. She didn&#x2019;t want to puke herself like the last time, when Mars Curiosity had landed. The fried eggs had ended up all over the front of her white lab coat, and she had become the star of a viral YouTube video that showed everyone cheering when Curiosity touched down&#x2014;and there she was, with breakfast all over her. <br>This morning would be even more nerve-racking for her than Curiosity. Back then, she&#x2019;d been only a midlevel techie. Now she was a team leader. Today was the first live trial of the $100 million Titan Explorer and its software package. <br>She arrived at seven. She wasn&#x2019;t the only one there&#x2014;a group of engineers had been there all night, charging the Bottle for the test&#x2014;but she was early enough that the giant testing facility was almost empty, filled with spooky echoes as her every footfall reverberated in the vast space. The Environment Simulator Facility was one of the largest buildings on the Goddard Space Flight campus, a warehouse-like space covering five acres of ground, occupied with bizarre machines and testing chambers. This was where satellites and space probes were frozen, shaken, heated, fried, irradiated, spun on centrifuges, and blasted with sound, to see if they could survive the forces of liftoff and the extreme environments of outer space. If they were going to fail, they would fail here, where they could be fixed and redesigned, instead of failing in deep space, where they could not. <br>This first test of the Titan Explorer was different from the usual Goddard test. They were not going to simulate the vacuum and cold of deep space. There were going to re-create the surface of Titan, the largest moon of Saturn&#x2014;a far more hostile environment. <br>Melissa Shepherd took her time strolling through the testing area. She breathed the air, redolent of hot electronics and chemicals, her eyes wandering among the gigantic, silent testing machines. She finally arrived at the central testing chamber, known as the &#x201c;Bottle.&#x201d; The Bottle stood inside a Class 1000 clean room constructed out of hanging sheets of plastic, with a laminar airflow filtering system. At the dressing area she put on her gown, gloves, hair cover, mask, and booties. She had done it so many times before it was rote. <br>She stepped through the heavy curtain of plastic and into the clean area. A soft hiss filled the space, and the air was cool, dry, and scentless&#x2014;filtered of almost every speck of dust and particle of water vapor. <br>The Bottle rose in front of her, a stainless steel container forty feet in diameter and ninety feet high, with gantries leading to hatches. The tank was surrounded by metal bracing, pipes, and conduits. Inside the Bottle, engineers had re-created a small portion of the Kraken Sea, the largest ocean on Titan. Today, they would put the Titan Explorer in the Bottle to test it under real-world conditions. <br>Saturn&#x2019;s largest moon was unique in the solar system. It was the only moon that had an atmosphere. It had oceans. It had rain and clouds and storms. It had lakes and flowing rivers. It had seasons. It had mountains and erupting volcanoes and deserts with dunes sculpted by wind. It had all this even though the surface of Titan hovered at 290 degrees below zero. <br>The liquid on Titan was methane, not water. The mountains were made of not of rock but of water ice. The volcanoes that erupted spewed not molten lava but, rather, liquid water. The atmosphere was thick and poisonous. The deserts were formed of tiny grains of tar, so cold they behaved like windblown sand on Earth. It was an extreme environment. But it was also one that might&#x2014;just might&#x2014;harbor life. Not like life on Earth, but a form of hydrocarbon-based life that could exist at three hundred degrees below zero. Titan was truly an alien world. <br>The Titan Explorer was a powered raft designed to explore the Kraken Sea, the largest on Titan. <br>Melissa Shepherd paused in front of the Bottle. It was a grotesque-looking thing, almost like a torture chamber. <br>She still couldn&#x2019;t believe that she was a key member of the Kraken Project, the first attempt to explore Titan. It was a dream come true. Her interest in Titan hearkened back to when she&#x2019;d been ten years old and had read Kurt Vonnegut&#x2019;s novel The Sirens of Titan. It remained her favorite book, one she dipped into again and again. But not even a genius like Vonnegut could have imagined a world as weird as Titan&#x2014;the real Titan. <br>Melissa Shepherd pulled out the checklist of the day and began going over it, visualizing the crucial tests that lay ahead. As eight o&#x2019;clock came around, the others began to arrive, greeting her with a nod or smile. At nine o&#x2019;clock, the actual countdown would begin. As they trickled in, chatting and laughing with each other, Melissa felt once again like an outsider. She had always felt a little awkward around her NASA peers. They were mostly �bernerds, brilliant overachievers who had come out of places like MIT and Caltech. She wasn&#x2019;t able to share in their nostalgic tales of winning spelling bees, triumphing in math club, and participating in the Intel Science Talent Search. When they&#x2019;d been the teacher&#x2019;s darlings, she&#x2019;d been boosting car radios to buy drugs. She almost didn&#x2019;t graduate high school, and was barely able to get into a third-tier college. She wasn&#x2019;t the normal kind of smart. It was a hard-to-control, neurotic, hypersensitive, manic, and obsessive form of intelligence. She was never happier than when she was in a dim, windowless room, all by herself, coding like mad, far away from messy, unpredictable human beings. Despite all that, in college she&#x2019;d managed to get her neurotic behavior under control and buckle down. Her odd genius was finally recognized, and she was able to finish up with an MS in computer science from Cornell. <br>Compounding the problem, and a never-ending problem for her, was that she was a six-foot blonde with long legs, a dusting of freckles, and a cute, turned-up nose. Girls like her were assumed to be brainless. They were not supposed to be rocket scientists. The only thing that saved her from being a total Barbie was a large gap between her two front teeth, called a diastema. As a teenager she had stubbornly refused to have it fixed despite her mother&#x2019;s entreaties&#x2014;and thank God for that. Who would have thought that a gap-toothed grin would have been a professional enhancement in her chosen field? <br>It still amazed her that she had been appointed leader of the team that coded all the software for the Titan Explorer. The assignment gave her a wicked case of impostor syndrome. But as she worked on the extremely daunting software problem&#x2014;one never before faced in a NASA mission&#x2014;she came to realize this was perfectly suited to her abilities. <br>The challenge was this: Titan was two light-hours from Earth. The Titan Explorer could not, therefore, be controlled in real time from Earth. The four-hour delay in passing instructions was too long, and the Kraken Sea of Titan was a fast-changing environment. The software had to be able to make decisions on its own. It had to be smart. It had to think for itself. <br>That is, it had to be artificially intelligent. <br>In a weird way, Melissa&#x2019;s outlaw past was a great help. She broke all the rules in writing code. To accomplish this task, she had created a new programming paradigm and even a new language, based on the concept of &#x201c;scruffy logic.&#x201d; Scruffy logic was an old idea in programming, and it referred to computer code that was loose and imprecise, striving for approximate results. But Melissa took scruffy logic one step further. She understood that the human mind works with scruffy logic. We can recognize a face or take in an entire landscape in an instant, something not even the most powerful supercomputer can do. We can process terabytes of data immediately&#x2014;but imprecisely. <br>How do we do it? Melissa asked herself. We do it because the human mind is programmed to visualize massive amounts of data. When we look at a landscape, we don&#x2019;t process it pixel by pixel. We take it all in at once. Program a computer to visualize numerical data&#x2014;or, better yet, visualize and auralize data&#x2014;and you&#x2019;ve got strong AI built on a platform of scruffy logic. <br>And that is precisely what Melissa did. Her software processed data by seeing and hearing it. In a sense, like a human being, it lived inside the data. The data actually became the physical world it inhabited. <br>And even though she was a resolute atheist, she called this new programming language Fiat Lux, after the first words of God when He supposedly created the world: Let there be light. <br>Instead of striving for correct output, Fiat Lux, in the beginning, produced output that was weak and filled with error. That was fine. The key was self-modification. When the program spewed out erroneous output, it self-modified. It learned from its mistakes. And the next time around, it was a little less wrong. And then a little less. <br>And for a while the self-modifying software platform that Melissa and her team were building worked well. It grew in accuracy and complexity. But then, over time, it began to degrade, totter&#x2014;and finally crash. For a year Melissa beat her head against the wall trying to figure out why, no matter how they framed the initial iterations, the software eventually fell apart and halted. One sleepless night she had a revelation. It was a software trick that would fix the problem&#x2014;a trick so utterly simple, so basic, so commonplace, and so easy to do that she was astonished no one had thought of it before. <br>It took her thirty minutes of coding to implement it, and it absolutely fixed the halting problem. It took AI programming to another level. It produced strong AI. <br>Melissa had kept the trick a secret. She sensed that it was worth billions of dollars, and that in the wrong hands it could be quite dangerous. She never even told her team about it, and so basic was the code that no one even noticed or understood the very simple thing it did. Suddenly, the software stopped crashing and no one knew why &#x2026; except her. <br>After thousands of simulations, in which the software self-modified, it was capable of reproducing all the qualities one would look for in a manned mission. It could operate all the equipment on the Titan Explorer raft with no input from mission control. It simulated a human astronaut being sent to explore a distant world, an astronaut possessed of such qualities as curiosity and caution, courage and prudence, creativity, judgment, perseverance, and foresight, all combined with a strong survival instinct, physical dexterity, and excellent training in engineering and troubleshooting. <br>Most important, the software continued to be self-modifying: it never stopped learning from its own mistakes. <br>The Kraken Project was the most complex ever attempted. It made Mars Curiosity look like a buggy ride through Central Park. The basic idea was to splash down a raft in the Kraken Sea. Over a period of six months, the Titan Explorer would motor around the sea, exploring the coastline and islands, eventually traveling several thousand miles from one shore to the other. A billion miles from Earth, this lonely raft would have to brave storms, wind, waves, reefs, currents, and possibly even hostile alien life-forms swimming in its methane waters. It would be the greatest sea journey ever made. <br>All this was in Melissa&#x2019;s mind as she finished her checklist and approached the control console, ready to begin the countdown. Jack Stein, the chief engineer, had taken his place at her side, with the mission director next to him. Stein&#x2019;s puffy clean suit and cap made him look like the Pillsbury Doughboy, but Melissa knew what was underneath that suit all too well. That had been one of her first impulsive moves at Goddard, getting involved with Stein. She and Stein had remained close after that intense fling, and it had somehow made their working relationship all the better. Melissa couldn&#x2019;t quite say why the relationship had ended, except that Stein had broken it off, gently alluding to the rumors and gossip in the hothouse environment of Goddard and how what they were doing had the potential to damage their careers. He was right, of course. This was an incredible mission, the opportunity of a lifetime. It would ring down in history. <br>As she took her place at the console she briefly locked eyes with Stein, gave him a nod and a half smile, which he returned with a crinkle around his eyes and a thumbs-up. Stein was booting up various instruments and making sure all systems were go, ensuring that the computers and valve servos that controlled and maintained the extreme conditions in the Bottle were working. Melissa initiated her own sequence checks. <br>From the elevated position on the console platform, she had a good view of the Bottle and the Explorer raft itself. For this test, the interior of the Bottle had been cooled to 290 degrees below zero and partly filled with a soup of liquid methane and other hydrocarbons. The atmosphere of Titan had been carefully synthesized and piped in&#x2014;a corrosive mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen cyanide, and tholins&#x2014;and pressurized to 1.5 bars. It had taken a week to prepare, chill, and charge the Bottle with this toxic soup. It was now ready to receive the Explorer for its first real-world test. This initial test was simply to see if it would survive, and if its antenna, mechanical arm, and spotlight would extend and retract under those extreme conditions. Later, they would run more complicated operational tests. If something was going to fail, it had better fail here, where they could fix it, rather than on the surface of Titan. Melissa hoped and prayed that if failure did occur, it would be in the hardware and not in her software. &nbsp; 3 <br> <br>Since her earliest consciousness had formed from a kind of white mist, she had lived in the palace. It was located on the shores of a sea, surrounded on three sides by a high wall of snowy marble. The wall had no gate or openings, but the palace grounds were open to the sea. <br>Her tutor&#x2019;s name was Princess Nourinnihar. They spent every morning together, in the palace garden, and the princess would teach her marvelous and mysterious things. Her first lessons focused on who she was, how she had been created, how her mind worked, and the nature of the world around her. She learned that her world consisted of a vast matrix of numerical data, a numberscape, which she processed through visualization and auralization. She lived inside the numbers. She saw them and heard them. Her mind was itself a complex, ongoing Boolean calculation. Her body, her senses, and her movements were also a numerical simulation. She was constrained to obey physical laws, bec...</p><h2>Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare: How Churchill&#39;s Secret Warriors Set Europe Ablaze and Gave Birth to Modern Black Ops</h2><p>From the award-winning historian, war reporter, and author Damien Lewis (<i>Zero Six Bravo, Judy</i>) comes the incredible true story of the top-secret "butcher-and-bolt" black ops units Prime Minister Winston Churchill tasked with stopping the unstoppable German war machine. Criminals, rogues, and survivalists, the brutal tactics and grit of these "deniables" would define a military unit the likes of which the world had never seen. <br>When France fell to the Nazis in 1940, Churchill declared that Britain would resist the advance of the German army--alone if necessary. Churchill commanded the Special Operations Executive to secretly develop of a very special kind of military unit that would operate on their own initiative deep behind enemy lines. The units would be licensed to kill, fully deniable by the British government, and a ruthless force to meet the advancing Germans.<br>The very first of these "butcher-and-bolt" units--the innocuously named Maid Honour Force--was led by Gus March-Phillipps, a wild British eccentric of high birth, and an aristocratic, handsome, and bloodthirsty young Danish warrior, Anders Lassen. Amped up on amphetamines, these assorted renegades and sociopaths undertook the very first of Churchill's special operations--a top-secret, high-stakes mission to seize Nazi shipping in the far-distant port of Fernando Po, in West Africa. <br>Though few of these early desperadoes survived WWII, they took part in a series of fascinating, daring missions that changed the course of the war. It was the first stirrings of the modern special-ops team, and all of the men involved would be declared war heroes when it was all over. <br><i>The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare </i>focuses on a dozen of these extraordinary men, weaving their stories of brotherhood, comradely, and elite soldiering into a gripping narrative yarn, from the earliest missions to Anders Larssen's tragic death, just weeks before the end of the war.<br></p><p><b>Damien Lewis </b>is a former war reporter. He is a prolific writer, penning over a dozen books, including <i>Zero Six Bravo, War Dog, </i>and <i>Judy. </i>"One of the most extraordinary stories of World War II . . . an eloquent and welcome tribute to their selfless, sometimes reckless courage--a howitzer of a tale that more people should know about."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Daily Mail</i></i></b><br><br>"An enjoyable, thought-provoking read."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Soldier Magazine</i></i></b><br><br>"A truly astonishing story."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Weekend Sport</i></i></b><br><br>"Kill without mercy, party like there's no tomorrow: Churchill's secret band of fearless warriors broke hearts, rules, and the Nazis' spirit." &#x2015;<b><i><i>The Daily Mail</i></i></b><br><br>"A valuable addition to World War II history, and a harbinger of the sort of war that the United States and other countries are learning to wage in the 21st century."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Washington Times</i></i></b><br><br>"The narrative reads like a thriller penned by novelist Vince Flynn, except this book is based on historical facts and records as well as interviews with participants. After reading this informative and engaging book, one can only admire the courage, tenacity, and innate ingenuity of these military 'misfits' who served with little recognition or due respect."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Toy Solider and Model Figure Magazine</i></i></b></p>
